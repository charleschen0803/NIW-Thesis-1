CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. My name is Greg, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder,
this event is being recorded.

Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you
may now begin.

Kristin Silberberg
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. So this morning, our Chairman
and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of third quarter results
referencing our presentation, which you can find on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation,
we'll be happy to take questions. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of
Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color.

Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties
that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on
Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review
our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliation in the appendix.

With that, I will hand over to Bruce.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Thank you, Kristin, and a good debut for you. Good to have you on the team.

Kristin Silberberg
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We feel really positive about how Citizens
continues to rise to the occasion and meet the unprecedented challenges of 2020. We're taking great
care of customers, colleagues and communities, while posting strong results that demonstrate the
diversification and resilience of our business model. We are delivering record levels of pre-provision profit,
and we're managing risks on our balance sheet well in the near term, while also preserving and making
the strategic investments to position us for growth and success in the long term.

Financial performance in Q3 featured record revenue, fee income and mortgage results. The low rate
and flat yield curve environment puts pressure on NIM, but our well-positioned mortgage business has
performed exceptionally well, capturing the refi opportunity, gaining market share and providing a natural
offset to low rates. We included a page on this business in our investor deck. In short, we believe the
mortgage business has room to run given a positive market environment, plus our own strong positioning
and capabilities.

In addition to mortgage, we saw a solid quarter in Capital Markets revenue given strong advisory and
underwriting performance and a nice rebound in wealth fees. Consumer fees also continue to move higher
off of the COVID and related lockdown lows, which should continue as the economy further reopens and
consumer behavior normalizes. These factors drove noninterest income growth of 11% sequential quarter
and 33% year-on-year. Combined with a modest decline in NII and broadly stable expenses, we delivered

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

underlying positive operating leverage of 2.6% sequential quarter and 9% year-on-year. Our pre-provision
net revenue grew by 22% year-on-year, and it's up 14% on a year-to-date basis.

Now this capital generation ranks near the top of peers and has allowed us to grow loans to support
customers, build a prudent level of credit reserves given the uncertainty of the environment, maintain
an attractive dividend payout, while delivering a 9.8% CET1 ratio, which is within our targeted range of
9.75% to 10%. This capital and reserve strength gives us tremendous financial flexibility going forward
from a strategic and an operational perspective.

Our view on the economy continues to be cautiously optimistic. Our consumer credit book is tracking
favorable to expectations given past stimulus, economic reopening and forbearance.

On the commercial side, we are seeing some selective credit stress in industry segments that are most
impacted by COVID-19 and the lockdowns. We took sizable charge-offs on 2 credits during the quarter,
as loss recognition can be a little lumpy. That said, we feel we are near peak charge-offs in commercial,
assuming the macro environment stays on the current trajectory.

Our work on TOP and BSO continues to make solid progress. We are adding material work streams to TOP
6 largely centered on digitization, and we will provide a full expense guide on our year-end call. On BSO,
we completed a student loan sale as we developed an originate-to-distribute model, and we've executed
an attractive sub-debt exchange that delivered both financial and regulatory capital benefits.

It's been quite a remarkable year, and we feel we've handled the challenge as well, and we're poised for
success as the economy recovers.

With that, let me turn it over to John for a thorough review of our financials. John?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone.

Let's start with a brief overview of our headlines for the quarter, starting on Page 5. This was an
outstanding quarter for Citizens, despite the ongoing challenges in the operating environment. We have
generated record revenue in PPNR in the last 2 quarters, with an excellent balance sheet position at
September 30.

For the third quarter, we've reported underlying net income of $338 million, EPS of $0.73 and record
revenue of $1.8 billion. Our underlying ROTCE was 9%.

PPNR increased 6% linked quarter to another record level and was up 22% year-over-year. We posted
record fee income for the quarter faced by record mortgage fees and strong results in Capital Markets and
Wealth. Also we delivered positive operating leverage of 2.6% linked quarter and 9% year-over-year, as
we continued our strong expense discipline.

Net interest income was down 2% linked quarter due to a 3% decline in loans given line draw paydowns
and a 5 basis point reduction in NIM due to rates and elevated cash. This was mitigated by excellent
results in interest-bearing deposit costs, which fell 13 basis points linked quarter to 35 basis points. I
should note that on a normalized basis, which adjusts for PPP loans, commercial line repayments and the
education loan sale completed in the quarter, average loans were up slightly linked quarter.

We increased our allowance for credit losses to $2.7 billion, which translates to a prudent ACL coverage
ratio of 2.29%, excluding PPP loans, up from 2.09% last quarter. Note that the reserve build during the
quarter of $209 million impacted EPS by $0.40 and ROTCE by 5 percentage points.

We believe charge-offs should be stable in Q4. And barring a deterioration in economic outlook, we should
start to see reserve releases beginning in the fourth quarter.

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Even with a significant reserve build, we demonstrated excellent balance sheet strength, ending the
quarter with a CET1 ratio of 9.8%, up 20 basis points linked quarter and back within our pre-COVID
operating level of approximately 9.75% to 10%.

Our liquidity ratios also improved as we ended the quarter with an LDR of 87%, and we remain in
compliance with the LCR. Our tangible book value per share is $32.24 at quarter end, up 2% compared
with a year ago.

On Page 6, I'll cover net interest income. Net interest income was down 2% linked quarter given the
impact of lower rates and a 3% decrease in loans as line draws were repaid, partly offset by lower
interest-bearing deposit costs and improved deposit mix. Despite the challenging rate environment,
net interest margin held up well, down 5 basis points this quarter. Rates drove a 7 basis point decrease
through lower asset yields, and higher cash balances were a 2 basis point impact. These were partially
offset by lower interest-bearing deposit costs and outsized growth in DDA.

Moving to Page 7. We delivered record results again this quarter in fees, reflecting our ongoing efforts to
invest in and diversify our revenue streams. Underlying noninterest income was up 11% linked quarter
and 33% year-over-year as our fee income ratio improved to 37%.

Mortgage banking delivered record results again this quarter on continued strength in originations, more
than offsetting the modest decline in margins compared to last quarter's all-time high. The mortgage
business continues to provide an excellent natural hedge as intended against low-rate pressure on NII.

The Wealth business rebounded nicely in the quarter with revenues rebounding to record levels. This was
driven by a strong increase in transaction volume and a solid increase in AUM.

Service charges and card fees continue to trend back to pre-COVID levels. Key consumer drivers were
increases in credit card purchase volume and debit card transaction volume, each of which is nearing pre-
COVID activity levels.

Capital Markets fees were down linked quarter driven primarily by a recovery in trading values in the
prior quarter. Excluding this, Capital Market fees were up 11% driven by accelerating activity in loan
syndications and M&A advisory.

Turning to Page 8, let's take a closer look at the mortgage business. The strong performance of the
mortgage business again this quarter has really boosted our overall performance, providing diversification
in this low-rate environment. The business continues to demonstrate the benefits of the scale and diversity
of our origination channels off the back of our 2018 acquisition of Franklin American. We have made
significant investments in the business over the last few years, upgrading our customer-facing technology
with our focus on innovating the customer experience. Over 60% of retail applications are now completed
through our digital app.

The strength of our multichannel distribution capabilities has enabled us to meet the extraordinary
increase in demand in the market, with 2020 the largest year for mortgage originations in U.S. history.
We expect volumes to remain elevated through 2021 at today's rates, and we expect to make market
share gains even as rates rise as we transition to a more purchase-driven market given our strength and
execution consistency and leveraging our scale and channel diversification across our retail, correspondent
and wholesale channels.

Turning to Page 9 on expenses. Underlying noninterest expense was down slightly linked quarter, reflecting
continued strong expense discipline that generated robust positive operating leverage in the quarter. This
continued expense discipline has contributed to the year-over-year and linked-quarter improvement in the
efficiency ratio, now at 53%. Salaries and employee benefits were relatively stable linked quarter and up
3% year-over-year due to expenses connected to strong mortgage banking production volumes.

Next, on Page 10, average core loans were down 3% linked quarter and up slightly after normalizing for
the impact of PPP loans, commercial line repayments and loan sales. We saw growth in consumer lending
in both mortgage and student.

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Moving to Page 11. Average deposits were broadly stable linked quarter and up 14% year-over-year, as
consumers and small businesses benefited from government stimulus and clients built liquidity. We were
especially pleased with our progress on deposit costs, which declined 29% or 10 basis points to 25 basis
points during the quarter. Interest-bearing deposit costs were down 13 basis points to 35 basis points.

We executed our deposit playbook to manage down deposit costs across all channels, while improving our
overall funding mix. We brought interest-bearing deposit costs down significantly by leveraging data and
analytics to personalize offers and optimize pricing for our Affluent and Mass Affluent customers.

We continue to see a shift towards lower-cost categories, with average DDA growth of 8% on a linked-
quarter basis and 40% year-over-year. This continues the peer-leading momentum we have demonstrated
in growing low-cost deposits over the last 3 years.

Turning to Page 12 to discuss our CECL methodology and reserves. We have summarized the key aspects
of our macroeconomic scenario, which is a foundational element of the CECL reserve estimate. This
scenario has improved slightly on that use in Q2. Nonetheless, we used management overlays and
qualitative factors to build reserves, focusing on expected performance trends in specific commercial
sector portfolios most impacted by COVID-related lockdowns, namely retail- and hospitality-related CRE
and casual dining as well as in selected retail products. We feel we are well reserved at this point for
extended pandemic and lockdown impacts from these sectors. Notwithstanding this sizable reserve build,
our CET1 ratio improved 20 basis points to 9.8% given our robust PPNR growth and lower RWAs.

On Page 13, we provide detail on our customer forbearance programs. In commercial, loans with payment
deferrals declined to 1.4% of our commercial loan book, down from 5.2% at June 30, and this has further
decreased to 1.2% as of October 13.

For retail, loans in forbearance have declined to 3.8% compared to 6% at June 30 and have further
declined to 3.4% as of October 13. This would be approximately 2% if we reported forbearance ending
immediately after the last deferred payment.

The performance of customers that have exited forbearance is trending well, with approximately 95% in
current status. Also for customers that have not taken any forbearance, the delinquency status is trending
favorably.

Deferrals in business banking are 8.1% and are expected to decrease to approximately 1% by the end of
October, with about 40% of our customers having received PPP funds and reopenings alleviating some of
the stress.

Turning to Page 14 on credit. Nonaccrual loans increased 29% linked quarter given a $254 million increase
in commercial, which was driven by 2 credits to mall REITs impacted by COVID-related lockdowns and
as well as a $33 million increase in retail. Note that our total mall rate exposure is approximately $400
million, with 2 credits now in NPA status and the other performing okay.

Net charge-offs were 70 basis points this quarter driven by 2 large credits in commercial: one to a mall
REIT; and one in metals and mining. The increase in commercial was partially offset by an improvement in
retail, reflecting the impact of forbearance and the improving economic backdrop in Q3.

We took a prudent $209 million reserve build this quarter, which increased our coverage ratio from 2.09%
in 2Q to 2.29% in 3Q, excluding PPP loans. Despite the somewhat lumpy increase in NPAs and charge-
offs during the quarter, we are seeing broad signs of progress in commercial credit quality as the economy
recovers.

In the appendix on Page 23, we provide you with an update on our view of the commercial portfolio. In
the commercial portfolio, as businesses have reopened and liquidity has improved from capital raising
and federal stimulus, we have seen sectors begin to stabilize. These include a combination in foodservices
credits, including quick-service food concepts that have performed well during the pandemic; the retail
trade sector, getting our portfolio of lower-risk gas stations and essential services; the less price-sensitive
credits in the energy and related sector; and finally, the arts, entertainment and recreation sector as
sports teams and stadiums that have further benefited from professional sports resuming.

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Given these positive trends, the areas we consider to be of elevated concern have dropped from 10%
in 2Q to approximately 5% of total loans. The remaining areas of concern have been particularly hit
by COVID-related closures mainly across retail-related CRE and hospitality, casual dining, retail trade,
educational services and price-sensitive energy.

On Page 15, as I mentioned earlier, we feel well positioned to manage through the current environment
with strong capital and liquidity positions. Our CET1 ratio improved to 9.8%, up 20 basis points linked
quarter given our strong PPNR generation and reduction in risk-weighted assets. We are now back in our
target range of 9.75% to 10%.

PPNR as a percentage of average assets was 3.9% year-to-date on a 9-quarter DFAST calculation basis
and has increased steadily over the last 5 years, reflecting the benefits of investments and increasingly
diversified revenue base. Strong deposit growth outpaced loan growth, which improved our liquidity
metrics and drove the spot LDR down to 87%.

During third quarter 2020, the company completed a subordinated debt exchange that will benefit total
capital going forward by increasing the percentage of qualifying Tier 2 debt.

Turning to Page 16, I'll update you on TOP 6. We continue to execute on the transformational and
traditional TOP programs, and they've clearly been instrumental in our ability to deliver positive operating
leverage and drive ROTCE improvement. The initiative we launched are expected to achieve the original
2020 pretax run rate target of $225 million, and we are still on track to hit the $300 million to $325
million by year-end 2021.

We are also adding significant work streams to TOP 6 largely focused on accelerating our digital
capabilities to create increased efficiencies and frictionless customer experiences. These should deliver
at least $100 million run rate by the end of 2021, and we are working to increase this, though we are
also working through the cost impact of how much we'll invest or reinvest in strategic initiatives to drive
future growth. We will be updating our expense outlook, including the benefit of the expanded initiatives
to upscale these programs as part of our 4Q earnings call in January.

On Pages 17 and 18, I want to highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company.
As we continue to strategically invest through the crisis to position us well for the medium term, we are
focused not only on digitization, but also initiatives that position the franchise well for the long term.

On the consumer side, we are focused on national expansion, with Citizens Access integrating some of
our lending businesses to further develop our national value proposition. In merchant finance, we are
continuing to add new merchants to our point-of-sale platform, launching 5 important new merchant
finance partners, with more in the pipeline, and we are piloting a new customer-led point-of-sale value
proposition.

In commercial, we continue to expand our capital and global markets capabilities, including completing
our first lead-left high-yield fixed income issuance, and we are also seeing increased client adoption of our
digital treasury solutions.

Now let's move to Page 19 for high-level commentary on the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect NII
to be broadly stable, with no expectation of PPP forgiveness benefit until next year. NIM is expected to be
down low to mid-single digits. Loans should be stable, securities up modestly. Fee income is expected to
be down mid-teens off the record third quarter level, reflecting lower mortgage banking fees. While we
expect to see mortgage results come down from 3Q record levels, we do see a significant fee opportunity
that should continue into 4Q and well into 2021 at attractive margins, albeit lower than recent historic
highs.

Noninterest expense is expected to be up modestly, reflecting seasonal factors, and we're on track for full
year operating leverage of around 4%. We expect relatively stable net charge-offs in the range of 60 to 80
basis points of average loans. We also expect a reserve release in Q4 given reserve builds taken year-to-
date, and we should see a decline in NPAs.

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

On Slide 20, to sum up, we continue to navigate successfully through the COVID-19 crisis. The resilience
of the franchise is again on display with record PPNR, record fee income and positive operating leverage.
We remain well positioned to continue to strategically invest and deliver on key initiatives. Our ability to
execute well drives our strong profitability, capital and liquidity positions.

With that, I'll hand it over to Bruce.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board
Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for the Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Wedbush Securities.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

I was just curious, what gives you the confidence that nonperforming assets are going to decline? And at
this point in the cycle, there still seems a lot of uncertainty that you'd be willing to release reserves next
quarter.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. Why don't I start, John, and then you could pitch in. So if you look at what drove up the NPAs this
quarter, it really was isolated to just 2 exposures we had to mall REITs, which, frankly, had been really
stellar-performing companies, best in class, which we've had long relationships with. But obviously, the
COVID and lockdowns and changed behavior caused some stress there, and so we've recognized that.

We do a pretty careful job of forecasting the migration through criticized assets and what could go NPA.
And so we think beyond that, we don't really -- as I think John said in his prepared remarks, we're seeing
some broad signs of optimism and some improvement in the overall commercial book. So we really don't
think we're going to be taking a lot new in, and then we'll have some charge-off -- some degree of charge-
offs, which will reduce the NPA. So you put that all together, and I think we're feeling pretty confident on
the commercial side.

And then if you look at consumer as well, we've had really, really healthy trends, even surprising -- to the
point of being surprising, but very solid in terms of delinquencies, so feel really good there as well. John?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes, may I -- I'd just add, just higher level. We have pretty good line of sight when you think about
over the next 60 to 90 days about what's going to migrate on the commercial side. I mean, we've got
paydowns and charge-offs that are coming through. And things -- as we mentioned in our overall areas
of market concern, we were at 10% last quarter. That number has fallen to 5%. We delineated where
the puts and takes are with respect to that in our slide deck. And so we've done a bottoms-up cash burn
analysis, which Don can comment on. So we feel reasonably comfortable with that guide on a nonaccruals
basis.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

And yes, just on the reserve levels with releasing reserves, just, I feel like there's still enough uncertainty
in the economy. Just what gives you a decision to release -- properly release reserves next quarter?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. I mean I'll go ahead and take that one. I mean, I think this comes back to the methodology of CECL
in the first place. I mean, we've been -- over time, there's been significant uncertainty with respect to the
scenario, and you saw how that trajectory played out over the first and second quarter where we built in
both quarters.

This quarter, the scenario actually got a little better. And I think, at least from what we can see, the level
of uncertainty has started to shape into something that we feel comfortable with our outlook. I think the
difference this quarter in terms of our build is we've been spending a lot of time with individual sector

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

reviews, and that really was those management overlays and the qualitative factors and what drove our
build this quarter.

After we've gotten through all of that, when we -- if the scenario -- barring a deterioration in the
environment, we feel like after analyzing what we expect the loss content to be in these categories, that
the reserving requirements have been satisfied. And so therefore, the loss content has been provided
for. And therefore, on a go-forward basis, the way CECL works is that you would charge off against the
reserves that you've already built, and the provisions would be driven by your origination and go-forward
activity. So from our standpoint, that would mean reserve releases, which -- with provisions less than
charge-offs.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America.

Erika Najarian
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So as we take a step back, obviously, unfortunately, given the timing of where we are in the year, I'm sure
you'll get a lot of questions on '21, and I know you'll defer us to January for details. But as we take a step
back and we think about all the work that you've done, either through the TOP programs and building your
fee income-generating capabilities and weigh that against, obviously, the interest rate challenges and the
swap income roll-off, as we think about normalized return sort of post the spike in credit that we all expect
for '21, as you think about normalized ROTCE for Citizens sort of in a post-COVID recovery world with no
help with rates, do you think that you have enough in the till with TOP or fee generation to achieve like a
10% or low double-digit ROTCE on the other side?

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I'll start and then, John, you can add your perspective. But yes, I think that's certainly the case,
Erika. So if you look at what we've delivered just this quarter was 9% with a huge reserve build, which the
build basically cost us 5% of ROTCE. So you can do the math on that.

But we'll, I think, going forward, have lower credit costs. We'll have some NIM headwinds. But again, we
consider hedges as part of the strategy in managing a low-rate environment, but our mortgage business
was also part of the strategy as well. And so there seems to be a great fixation on hedging, and some
folks have put hedges on. I think we've done a nice job there, but some folks may have some longer
duration or more hedges, but they don't have the size mortgage business that we have.

And so I think, if you look at our PPNR generation through this year, we're really top of the class in terms
of how we've been performing. So we expect there to be linked to run in the mortgage business through
next year. 60% of the households in the country would benefit, I'd say, by more than 50 basis points in
terms of the math if they refinance their mortgage. So there's going to be continued demand on the refi
side.

As the market goes back to a purchase market, we also are very well positioned. We probably have the
most diversified origination channels of any bank-owned mortgage company with exposure to retail, to
correspondent and wholesale. We've worked really hard to digitize that business and gain market share
and be able to handle volumes efficiently. So I feel really good about that.

So I'd say we're kind of on the doorstep of crashing through double-digit ROTCE. I think we can get there
and certainly sustain it. But it's going to take all the levers of the fee investments that we've made, doing
more TOP and continuing to focus on driving efficiencies, looking for volume in terms of loan growth, and
we see -- we think there's going to be some opportunities. We think we uniquely have some niches on
the consumer side that some of our peers don't have. And I think also, in commercial, we've been able to
achieve nice growth through the build out of some of our regional geographies.

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

So we know what we have to do, we know what the objective is and we're going to keep driving towards
that original medium-term targets. I think you probably need a little help from rates to get all the way
there. But certainly, double-digit seems like a bar we can hurdle. John?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. I think -- not too much to add other than I think it's -- I think that we have been a self-help story in
the past, and I think we absolutely remain so going forward.

In the NII space, our BSO actions and with interest-bearing deposit costs at around 35 basis points,
there's a lot of opportunity there for us. And we are a completely different bank than we -- this is first is
last. And so you can expect that our interest-bearing deposit costs are going to find new lows for the bank
compared to where we were at the end of the last ZIRP.

On fees, like night -- it's night and day with respect to our diversification. A combination of the organic
investments that we've made and the inorganic acquisitions that we've made have been extremely
powerful in the fee generation space as you're seeing in mortgage. But we shouldn't forget about wealth,
which is hovering around record levels on its own. But sometimes, it gets overshadowed by the eye-
popping numbers in mortgage, but the diversification there is great. And the Capital Markets business has
never been more diversified.

And then in -- and finally, expenses, we've had a history of our TOP 6 programs. That will continue, that
will be a hallmark of what we do, and we have a lot more opportunity there as well. So those are the final
points I'd make.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I just wanted to ask on credit broadly. What is your sense for when loss content will really begin to
materialize? I think it kind of feels like it keeps getting pushed back, and the consensus view now seems
to be sort of mid- to even late 2021. So just curious to hear your thoughts.

And then just at a very top level, what kind of cycle, like, do you really think you're sort of setting
yourselves up for? It seems like with current info, most of the economy will sort of slog through, and it's
just these isolated areas that will see the real pain. So is this something where we could really resolve
most of the credit cycle next year? Or do we see this sort of bleeding on for a couple of years from here?

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Sure. So what I'd say on that is you have to look at commercial and you have to look at consumer.
Consumer has been extremely well behaved, and we've had folks on forbearance. The people rolling
off forbearance have actually been current, and we haven't seen any uptick in charge-offs. But I think
the residual folks who are on forbearance, there will be some charge-off content there, and I think that
probably doesn't peak until sometime in the middle of next year. So whether that's Q2 or Q3, we'll see.

I think on the commercial side, we've got hit with 2 one-offs this quarter. And there's -- the pig is going
through the python. I don't think there's significant jumps on the commercial side. I think we're probably
nearing the peak charge-offs, but they'll stay elevated for a while before they move back down, I think, in
the second half of the year.

So I'd say our outlook is that most of this should resolve over the course of next year, setting us up for, I
think, more normalized charge-off rates as we head towards 2022.

Any comments there, Brendan? Do you want to comment on the consumer side at all?

Brendan Coughlin
Head of Consumer Banking

Yes, let me just add a little specificity. So John quoted a few numbers in forbearance. We're increasingly
confident that, that portfolio is of high quality, particularly with some portfolios that were of high interest
that hadn't gone through a cycle before. Our student portfolio is holding up incredibly well so far, and the
merchant finance portfolio is equally holding up incredibly well. And in fact, that portfolio has almost no
customers in forbearance at all. And delinquency is still flat for pre-COVID.

So we're feeling really, really strong about consumers. As John mentioned, the customers that are firmly
still in forbearance has moved from a peak of ever forbearance at 8% to now 2%. And our delinquency
rates have been flat to down at the same time. So we're seeing a lot of gearing out of the forbearance
portfolio with very minimal impact to distressed consumer behavior so far. So -- and we're out of the
woods, but surprising on the green shoots that we're seeing are quite positive.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. And Don, maybe you want to talk about…

Donald H. McCree
Vice Chairman & Head of Commercial Banking Division

Yes, I'd echo that. And I do think it's kind of elevated for next year, but we're kind of peaking out where
we are right now. I think -- remember, I'll just emphasize what Bruce said. Our view is based on a client-
by-client liquidity analysis, where we project out current rates of cash generation versus current rates of
cash burn, and we're seeing really positive trends. We've taken 25% of the companies that were in the
high-risk category out of that category based on our last analysis.

We're also seeing record level of customer deposits, so they have heavy levels of liquidity sitting with us.
And we're seeing -- on a customer-by-customer basis, we're seeing the bigger customers, as everybody
knows, are going to the public markets and grabbing any amount of liquidity that they get in the high yield
in the equity markets. And the smaller customers, while they're having a little bit of a more difficult time,
they're managing their businesses in a really conservative way for cash. So they've kind of cut expense
levels, and they're positioning their businesses to survive a extended slowdown, if there is an extended
slowdown. So we feel good about what the customers are doing on an individual basis.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Great. That's perfect color. And I guess, if I could sneak one in here. Just Bruce, you noted the kind of
emerging emphasis on things like hedging programs, which you guys have benefited from. I've noticed
the same thing. I guess, maybe, John, as you sort of think about things into next year, when and how
do we see some of those hedges that you guys have put in place roll off? And sort of what is the sense?
Should we just sort of recast our focus onto the fee drivers such as mortgage and wealth that you alluded
to earlier? Or how do we kind of replace those benefits as they do roll off?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. I mean, basically, the hedges that are in place roll off throughout 2021. By the end of 2021, most of
that benefit is starting to wane. But what I do is take a step back on NIM overall. The levers that we're
pulling and have very large opportunity to get after is what I mentioned earlier. With respect to interest-
bearing deposit costs sitting at 35 basis points, we expect those to decline significantly in 2021. We --
that's on the sort of funding side of things.

We also are focusing on the asset side, so we have broader BSO efforts, rotating our capital and allocating
it into better risk/return categories and profiles.

And then I'd -- you heard from Bruce earlier, the mortgage business has room to run. There are trillions
of dollars of mortgages that are -- that have a refinance incentive. And I think that -- I would say, that
we're -- we have -- that business is rate-sensitive and has been part of our hedging story and has done
incredibly well and a lot of the NIM headwinds. Frankly, I guess I could say most of the headwinds, all of it
in 2020, and probably on a cumulative basis through 2021, most of those rate headwinds will be offset by
expected mortgage fee -- elevated mortgage fee revenues.

So -- and then, of course, you heard -- when you have rates falling, that's a big impact, and we'll have
to look at all the levers across the self-help that we feel like is alive and well here, and that would include
expenses, and TOP 6 is part of that.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. And the last thing I would say, Scott, and I know hope is not a strategy. But if you consider that we
could see real progress on the health front, and you could get -- these treatments are progressing nicely,
vaccines are progressing, you could see another stimulus bill. It seems like the folks in Washington are
getting closer on that. You could actually see a fairly decent rebound next year, which could result in a
steepener in the curve, which could create a lot of benefits and also opportunities to lay on some more
hedges. So anyway, we're keeping our eye on that but…

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. We may be on some hedge…

Also on the credit front, I know you mentioned the -- that you're closely tracking loss migration, and that

-- do you have what your total criticized assets trends were for the third quarter and how that may break
down in terms of the special mention versus classified?

Okay. All right. And then also on the credit side, the -- wanted to see if you could just give us a little bit
of update on what you're seeing in your commercial real estate portfolio. Are you beginning to see stress
there? I know you mentioned the mall REITs, but just curious about other properties, how that portfolio is
trajecting. It looks like you added a fair amount to the reserve this quarter there.

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. I think it's really what we mentioned. It's retail and hospitality where we're focused. If you click
through the different asset classes, office looks like it's holding up pretty, well with rents being paid. Well,
multifamily, looks like it's holding up pretty well. We've got our eye on trends there.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

We don't have the big exposure to some of the cities suffering, bigger tips like New York and San
Francisco, fortunately.

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Right. And then you get into industrial and health care, and those are also holding up quite well. So the
place we're focused is on the retail and hospitality.

On the hospitality side, we've got an exposure to business travel, which has obviously slowed. But we've
got very diversified sponsors, and we've got some support provided by those sponsors in terms of flag
chains, which have overlay guarantees on some of that. So it's really around the other areas of retail, and
we feel like we're in pretty good shape with the reserves we put up at this point.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I think what we tried to do here was really look at if we're in an extended period of either lockdowns
or consumer behavioral shifts that goes well into 2021. And if that puts more stress on these narrow
sectors, let's make sure we've taken credit off the table and put up a sizable reserve there.

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

And the other thing I mentioned is we are working with all of the sponsors. We really bank the best
sponsors out there, and they're working with us, and they're restructuring the properties that are having
temporary dislocation. So -- and we've given some forbearance, but they're also putting some money in to
pay interest and keep the properties operate.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. If I could just ask one more on the efficiency, that $100 million, just to confirm, we
do not yet know how much will fall to the bottom line of that $100 million.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. That's good, John. So we conveyed -- we communicated appropriately. So we are going to -- we're
working on launching a number of work streams. Some of those are in Brendan's area in consumer, the
big digitization push. And so far, the tally is up to at least $100 million. So that's good news, and we're
going to keep trying to drive that higher.

We also have a couple of pages in there on some of our strategic initiatives. And so one of our objectives
here is to really keep investing for our future, so that we come out of this challenging period in even
better position with a stronger franchise that's positioned to grow and to continue to do well. And so we're
working through the pacing of some of those investments and which ones to prioritize.

So we're kind of reluctant at this point to give you a full update on expense guidance until we complete
that work. But I'm sure, we knew there was going to be a clamoring for what have you got so far, so we

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

If I could just follow up on the last question a little bit. So TOP 6, you're on track, and you still have
another $75 million to $100 million by year-end. And then the new $100 million on top of that, not looking
for expense guidance, but just can you help us understand, of that $175 million to $200 million that you
-- at minimum, you expect to get next year, the approximate mix of like what comes through expenses
of that and what comes through revenues of that because you're talking about like these new revenue
opportunities, as you had just alluded to, Bruce?

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes.

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. I'll go ahead and take that. I mean, I think in -- the majority of this is an expense-driven program.
There are some revenue opportunities that are there in the traditional TOP program, as we have done
historically. But for example, the transformation piece of this is 100% expenses for the most part. And
I would say that, that's really the main driver of the program. But we also do use the program to fund
revenue opportunities as well and to drive the upside on that front.

I would hasten to add, though, that when you start doing the numbers, you're looking at the run rate
target of around $225 million by the end of this year. That rises to as high as $325 million, so there's $100
million there. And then we also mentioned the additional $100 million at least that Bruce mentioned as
well. So we wanted to make sure that we weren't losing track of those different hundreds.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes. Exactly. Yes. Okay. Very good. And then second question, just, John, on the PPP in general. Many
banks have thought through that forgiveness might start in the fourth quarter. It seems like you guys
are conservative in terms of not at least putting it in your core, your NII guide. But can you just help us
understand, and I know it's more of a timing question, but just what you expect and how do you expect us
to all go with regards to forgiveness timing. And also just how much was PPP in the 3Q NII as well?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. Sure. I'll start off and maybe Brendan will comment on it. But in terms of process, I mean, the
forgiveness process can take up to 5 months. There's many steps that have to be made. Maybe Brendan
can talk about the invitation approach that we're taking in the fourth quarter. But I think that our view is,
given the complexity there, that it would be appropriate to -- in the outlook to not include any acceleration
with respect to forgiveness as a benefit.

That said, we do -- as you know, the way the accounting works is that we are incorporating the expected
fees on a level yield basis over the life of the 24 months of these loans. And so every quarter that goes

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

by, we are recognizing P&L that is attributable to the PPP program. In the third quarter, the yield on the
program is nearing -- somewhere between -- nearing 3% in terms of yield. And from a pretax standpoint,
if you -- it's maybe in the $25 million range for the third quarter.

So that gives you a sense. And all of that, when I call it pretax flow, that's really after the expenses.
That's a tiny bit higher on the NII line. So -- and that number will be -- with no forgiveness, we'll see that
again in a similar number in the fourth quarter given the way that the accounting works and if forgiveness
really -- is really a 1H 2021 event as we are forecasting.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. And I would say one thing on that. It's Bruce, and then I'll let Brendan go. But Ken, initially, you -- we
take it out over roughly 8 quarters, and I think we had $140 million, $150 million roughly to amortize on
a straight-line basis. But we thought that forgiveness would occur much sooner. We had thought some of
that would trickle into Q3 and Q4. But now, it looks like that will largely be a '20 -- first half '21 event.

But the spike is going to be lower since the longer this goes towards the end of the period, then you won't
get the same spike as if you had a massive acceleration into, say, Q3. That would have really altered the
timing in a material way. But at this point, since we are steadily recognizing and then there's less time
remaining to accelerate, the spike shouldn't be as dramatic, just to make that mathematical point.

Brendan Coughlin
Head of Consumer Banking

Yes. On the timing, the one thing I would just add is, keep in mind, the customer doesn't need to incur
interest charges until October of next year, and so there's no huge pressure point for our customers to
apply for forgiveness right this second. And so with -- they don't have to pay, they don't have to pay. So
with the various bills going through Congress that would possibly be quite positive to these customers,
there's a bit of a waiting game, and that's what we're hearing from most customers is that they'd rather
wait and see what flexibility is afforded to them before they jump in and start the forgiveness process. So
we're getting a handful trickled in.

And then to John's point, once the customer provides all their documentation, the SBA still has a 3-month
window to stamp it and say, "Yes. It's able to be forgiven." And that's the recognition event, is when the
SBA stamps it. So there's a bit of a tail on this as we expected, as Bruce pointed and John pointed out to
be…

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

And a few things. Some small business owners are being cautious here and just holding on to that cash to
see what the forgiveness terms are that they would not have to pay it back, which is one of the reasons
we still have elevated cash balances. So they've dipped into their own pocket to keep the lights going in
the business. And so we'll -- I think there's just a bit of caution generally, as you said.

Brendan Coughlin
Head of Consumer Banking

Yes, yes.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Understood. One just quick clarification, John. That $25 million pretax, was that the fee part of it? Or was
that also with the NII just from the loan yield?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. It's -- that's a fee part of it and the NII, so it's all-in, and that's consumer and commercial.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So just in terms of credit, it sounds like the management overlays drove most of the reserve build this
quarter. What did your CECL model, if we look at CECL by itself, actually tell you to do with the reserves?

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

I think it's hard to parse it, Ken, actually, because, to us, the CECL model is not just a macro forecast. It's
a process that involves many, many, many variables, and management judgment is one of those variables.
So I think it's just hard to parse that.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then maybe just on the same topic. I guess, why apply the management overlays this
quarter? I mean, I'm sure you had some earlier in the year, but it seems like maybe this quarter had more
of the qualitive adjustments rather than during the…

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Yes. I think we've had -- overlays are -- and qualitative factors are part of the process every quarter. I
think the reason to call these out was you had a slight divergence. It looked like the macro forecast was
a little better. The backdrop was a little better. But what we're seeing is that consumer behavior and the
effect of lockdowns is going to be more prolonged, and I think we saw when we were assessing it in the
first quarter and second quarter. We think it could be well into 2021 before we get back to the life as we
knew it, into a normal lifestyle, which means these retail and hospitality, entertainment, travel, all of that
genre could still be in a difficult situation for longer.

So you wouldn't necessarily pick that up from your macro forecast. I mean that's a kind of unique aspect
of certain businesses are disproportionately impacted from the new normal about how we're living our life,
and so that's why we're calling that out.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan.

Vivek Juneja
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

A couple of -- I'm going to just follow up on some of the themes that have been coming up. The release in
reserves, Bruce and John, that you're expecting in the fourth quarter, which loan categories do you think
that you're expecting to see that at this point? Where is that visibility coming from?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. I mean, I'll go ahead and take that. It's -- Vivek, it's kind of like -- the way CECL works, as you know,
I mean, we provide for all of the loans that we -- that are outstanding at September 30, both for the loss
content that we see after considering our macroeconomic scenario and then our qualitative factors that
we review by loan category. And if we're right, and it's very hard to say that you can be, there's so much
uncertainty, that -- a lot of that build, as you know, in the third quarter came through the commercial
portfolios and, as we've mentioned earlier, CRE and retail and hospitality, and we also mentioned casual
dining as sectors where we've built reserves.

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

So once that's done, then, theoretically, at least, you're just going to charge off against those reserves
going forward, assuming you were right about what the loss content is and what the scenario will be. The
rest of your provisioning then would only be focused on your front book activity and growth. So where
we're going to grow going forward, let's say, for example, in the residential mortgage and student and
merchant spaces, we would provide additional reserves for those loans as they come on as well as the C&I
loans that we're going to see as you get to the end of the fourth quarter. So it really is -- you have to sort
of look at it in those 2 buckets as we extend…

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

And just to make an assumption that the environment won't deteriorate in a meaningful way, so that you
wouldn't need to add to any further reserves around the back book. Now there could be some of that, but
we don't see it -- a sufficient amount of it to result in a reserve build and a need for reserve build.

Vivek Juneja
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And what are you thinking about the student loan book? Because that forbearance rate has stayed
pretty high. It hasn't come down. It's higher than even resi mortgages. Could you comment on why that's
the case? They've just not come up for -- how long is the forbearance period? Have they just not come up
yet? Or have they gone -- or what percentage have gone in for an extension of the deferral?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

So we're actually starting to see it gear down a little bit in the recent weeks. It was lagging a little bit
principally because the majority of our student loan book is student loan refi. And a lot of those customers
also have government loans, which had significant forbearance periods that were kind of automatically
granted. And so customers were triggered by the government event, and they called all the private
lenders and banks and raised their hand for forbearance. And there's sort of no reason for them to delink
those 2.

So we've been aggressively working with our customers to make sure we try to understand where they're
at and if there's a capacity to pay. But if they are still on the fence, we've been allowing them a little bit
of leeway to land on their feet. But every underlying dynamic we see in that portfolio is quite positive.
We call it a superprime portfolio. The credit is [ 7 80 ] plus in that portfolio. And particularly in the refi
portfolio, they'll make 6-figure income. That's the sector that's been the least impacted by unemployment.
And so we feel quite strong that this is -- there's no significant underlying dynamic that's different in
student than any other portfolio in consumer.

Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So a couple of questions. First, John, you mentioned that you -- the hedges should mostly roll off, and the
headwinds from the hedges rolling off should be pretty -- for the most part, fully realized by the end of
'21 and certainly '22. And I think we've estimated that the headwind is probably in the $200 million, $250
million annualized from the hedges rolling off. Can you -- is that -- I mean, can you just give us a sense of
the magnitude of the incremental headwinds, if our number is more or less right? How should we see that
-- those incremental headwinds sort of materialize in '21 and in '22?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. It would be a fraction of that. I -- without really getting into the numbers, it's not nearly that big. It's
not -- it's nowhere near that from what we can see. How we track through 2020, I mean, you got to think

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

about where -- what the terms are and -- which we publish. And you can see what the terms are on those
swaps, I believe. But it's much, much lower than that.

And I'd say, if I could just bring it back bigger picture to -- sure, those are running off, but the mortgage
business has been part of our hedging strategy all along. The majority of the NIM headwinds on a
cumulative basis are being offset in 2020 and 2021 by the mortgage business. And we also have a
very significant lever with respect to interest-bearing deposit costs this time around in ZIRP given all
of the investments we've made in the analytics and product capabilities and orientation of our bank
across consumer and commercial with respect to the relationship-driven deposit gathering that we have
embarked upon, which takes years to do, but that started many years ago. So we're starting to see that
bear fruit. Those are the things I think about when you're trying to consider the puts and takes for next
year.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. No, I get that. But maybe we can go over with the mechanics offline, but there does seem to be
a sense from the investment community that the headwinds we're talking about, on a static basis, not
factoring in some of the offsets are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But just to be clear, you're
saying that estimate, just on aesthetic basis, nothing else, just the hedge you're rolling off, that number is
way too high. Is that correct? Is that right?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

That's correct, that's correct. And we can take you through the math on that offline with some publicly
available information, and we'll just make sure that you can -- you're seeing it the way we see it.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Just one other question on NII. What are you assuming for forgiveness in -- ultimately throughout
the course of the first half of next year, what percentage of loans?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

So the full percentage -- so we're -- there's a 15% tail that we think will be forgiven on the back end. And
so the other 85% will come through mostly in 1H, but there's some that will come through in the third
quarter as well.

Operator

That question comes from the line of Dave Rochester from Compass Point.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Just on your NIM guidance, was just curious how much deposit growth you're assuming that feeds into
that, if any or if you're looking for more of that continued favorable mix shift that you've been having
there, favoring the lower cost of deposit?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. It's primarily a mix shift story. I mean, we've gotten surge deposits like many other banks. We think
some of that may stick around for quite a while in through -- well into 2021, so there's that benefit. We've
paid down -- everything you can pay down, and we're sitting around with some excess cash. And so
excess cash is a drag on NIM, call it, about a 2 basis point drag or so in -- on a quarter-over-quarter basis
in the fourth quarter. But it's getting up to near, call it, 8 to 10 basis points on an absolute basis in the
fourth quarter, all that excess cash. We'll see -- we'll look to see that pay down over time.

But as it relates to deposits, really, we're seeing great mix shift into DDA. We've had, I think, 3 years
running now, peer-leading DDA growth, and that's part of the next story. And it's just accelerating that
trend that already was happening with us. That's nice to see on the deposit side.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Yes. You mentioned the cash that's sitting there. I mean, are there any lumpy maturities on the borrowing
side that maybe you can take advantage of and use some of that cash to pay those down? Anything over
the next year that we can look for will help the [ push-in ]?

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. I mean not a lot. So our flow of funds are down to 0. And then our senior debt, we only have very,
very modest and maturities coming in early 2021.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

We just called one issue, and we did a sub debt exchange. So we're working that as much as we can, but
not a huge amount of opportunity there.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Yes. All right. And then if you guys have any color on new loan yields and securities purchase yields that
you guys are seeing today. I'm just trying to get a sense for where we could ultimately be going on the
average earning asset yield if we continue to see this flat curve over the next couple of years.

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. And so for securities, I'll take. And maybe Don or Brendan want to talk about spreads, but -- I mean,
on the loan side. But it's not a great story on the securities side. There's a 40, 45 basis point, call it,
negative front book/back book in terms of runoff, which comes off at around, call it, 190 basis points. And
you've got reinvestment coming on at around 140 or 145 on the front book for securities. So that's the
story there.

I think in commercial, we're seeing strong -- sort of spreads are up, but rates are down, so that's good. In
the consumer side of things, we're seeing some interesting positive trends there in auto, which has been
quite good and really strong spreads there.

And maybe I'll just let Don or Brendan add anything else.

Brendan Coughlin
Head of Consumer Banking

Yes. I think auto has been very strong. Student loan refi has also been very strong. We're seeing a
significant increase in margin across basically all the products. So…

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Maybe I'll also add merchant. We just had a nice string of wins. And Apple just launched their -- is
launching their new product.

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 16, 2020

Our merchant business kind of has the profile of a credit card business. Apple, we're gearing into the
new product release for them right now with the 5G bump, so we're enthusiastic about that. Microsoft All
Access has geared up for this big launch right now seasonally.

And we just launched, as John pointed out earlier, 5 new merchant partners really centered in home
improvement, electronics and fitness, similar to our Peloton relationship with the firm. So we're really
bullish about the growth there. We're actually getting some really decent momentum that should really
help offset some of the yield headwinds on some of the other portfolios by bringing in something of that
high yield.

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & CFO

Yes. On commercial, we're generally getting anywhere from 10 to 30 basis points better spreads on new
originations, and we're also putting LIBOR floors on a lot of transactions, which are helping the overall
yield. That seems to be holding.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
CEO & Chairman of the Board

Okay. All right. Thanks for the question. Okay. I think that's it for the queue. Thanks again for dialing in
today, everyone. We appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. And everybody, stay well.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and
for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.
