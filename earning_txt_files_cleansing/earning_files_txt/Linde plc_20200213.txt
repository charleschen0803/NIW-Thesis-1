Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q4 and Full Year 2019 Linde
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being
recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr.
Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.

Juan Pelaez
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, Daniel. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2019 fourth quarter
earnings call and webcast. Once again, this is Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this
morning by Steve Angel, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer.

Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please
read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides, and note that it applies to all
statements made during this teleconference.

The reconciliation of the adjusted pro forma numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Steve and
Matt will now give us an update on Linde's performance, including 2019 highlights and our new 2028
sustainability targets.

We will then be available to answer questions. Let me turn the call over to Steve.

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

So if you had told me a year ago that this is where we would be today as a new company, I would have
been delighted. We had the plans in place, but we had a lot of work to do. And I'm pleased to say the
team executed beautifully. A few financial highlights for the year. We saw underlying growth of 4%, half
price and half volume. Operating margins climbed nicely, 160 basis points to 18.7% and earnings per
share grew 23% ex FX.

We had strong cash flow for the year, especially in the second half, which is always a good sign of a
healthy and improving business. I'll let Matt expand more on that. And with that strong cash flow, we
invested $4 billion back into the business in CapEx, half for contracted large projects and returned
$8 billion to shareholders between dividends, share buybacks and the squeeze out of our minority
shareholders.

And return on capital, the single-most important metric for any capital-intensive business, rose 130 basis
points to 11.6%.

We also reached a record backlog of projects, $4.4 billion for our sale of gas business and $5.7 billion for
our third-party engineering business, $10 billion in total.

I'm pleased to say that we won practically every project we chose to pursue. This provides the foundation
for growth in future years as we bring these projects online. And with respect to integration, it's largely
done.

We conducted our first employee survey, and we were pleased with the overall results. This is a good
indication of how well the team integrated 2 high-quality companies in a relatively short period of time.

We began implementing our strategy, which is to build network density in core industrial gas geographies,
leverage our significant advantage in engineering and technology to win more than our fair share of sale of
gas opportunities and capture the full value of the merger, which includes cost and CapEx efficiencies and
growth synergies, and it is the latter that we are getting more and more excited about every day.

LINDE PLC FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

Coming out of this year, we definitely expect to see additional growth from merger synergies on top of
base industrial production, price and project start ups. And beyond that, beyond the typical 3-year kind
of post-merger phase, I believe the greatest and most enduring value created from our merger will come
from the sharing of our collective knowledge, experience and capabilities.

We also wanted to establish a strong foundation of operational excellence. Our safety performance
continues to trend positively with best-in-class performance in many categories. Another key priority for
this year was to implement a robust productivity initiative, and we made a lot of progress towards that
end.

Productivity initiatives need to be revitalized from time to time, and we see the expansion of our digital
tools and capabilities driving continuous improvement in our company for years to come.

Let's talk about 2020. Yes, it is an uncertain world. We gave you a chart in the back, so you can
understand our exposure on a country-by-country basis.

It's never a bad idea to have nearly 1/3 of your sales and operating profit in the United States. It is a good
time for me to remind you of the resiliency of our business model. We generate strong cash flow through
the economic cycle. When the economy is strong, we invest more in CapEx for growth. And when it is
weaker, we return more of that cash to shareholders. Add to that, the value created by our merger, and
you can see why I am confident in our ability to continue to generate double-digit earnings growth.

Regarding climate change. Everyone wants to know if you're a part of the problem or part of the
solution. Here at Linde, we are definitely part of the solution. We have a long track record of success and
sustainability having been recognized in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index chemical sector for 17
consecutive years, the only chemical company in 2019 that can make that claim.

We are also aligned with the aspirations of the Paris climate accord. However, this requires many parties,
government, industry and society as a whole to come together and play an active role.

I can tell you that as a leading industrial company, we will certainly continue to do our part to make
our world more sustainable. In fact, that is our mission statement, making our world more productive.
Through our solutions, technologies and services, we are making our customers more successful and
helping to protect and sustain our plan.

At Linde, we make products that are beneficial to our environment and society as a whole. In fact, over
50% of our sales today come from our sustainability portfolio, that is products that bring environmental
and social benefits. We make high-purity oxygen for medical needs and to purify water for drinking. We
produce krypton that is used for insulation. We make nitrogen that helps keep our customers operations
safer. We manufacture coatings for turbine blades that make aircraft engines more energy efficient. And
we make hydrogen to desulfurize and decarbonize transportation fuels to meet ever stricter environmental
standards.

In terms of greenhouse gas impact, the products we provide, enable our customers to avoid more than
twice as much greenhouse gas emissions as Linde emits as an entire company. That is a track record we
are proud of, and we certainly want to continue to live out our mission statement of making our world
more productive.

But in addition to that, we want to set new sustainability goals. By the year 2028, which marks 10 years
from the date of our merger, we will invest at least $1 billion in new decarbonization capital projects.
Examples of that would be carbon capture and sequestration; hydrogen mobility, like the agreement we
just signed to build hydrogen refueling stations in South Korea; green hydrogen projects for industrial
customers; and hydrogen to produce renewable fuels.

We will spend at least 1/3 of our R&D annual budget on decarbonization. We will continue to develop
industry leading technologies, like dry reforming, which uses CO2 as a feedstock in lieu of steam to
produce syngas. This is a technology we developed in conjunction with BASF. And we want to continue to
advance our own carbon capture technologies to make them more economically viable. We will continue to

LINDE PLC FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

invest in promising green hydrogen technologies, like our $50 million investment in ITM to scale up their
electrolyzer technology for industrial and hydrogen mobility applications.

We will double our annual purchases of renewable power. How much is that, you might ask. Today, we buy
about 16 terawatts of renewable power or about $1 billion of renewable power purchase each year. That
is enough electricity to power 4.7 million homes here in Germany. And our goal is to double the amount
of renewable power we will purchase. As a result, we will lower our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by
35%. Why not more, you might ask. We would love to, but that's going to be a function of the availability
and reliability of renewable power, which is far from certain today in many of the countries we operate in
around the world.

I can tell you that everyone at Linde, all 80,000 of us, are excited and passionate about what we can do to
make our world more sustainable.

And now I'll turn it over to Matt.

Matthew J. White
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by providing a summary of the fourth
quarter results, which can be found on Slide 5. Sales of $7.1 billion increased 1% over both prior year and
third quarter. Versus 2018, underlying sales improved 3% due to 1% more volume and 2% higher pricing.
Price improvements are broad-based across every region and in line with global weighted inflation rates.
The volume increase is mostly driven by project startup activity as organic volumes were relatively stable
due to growth in Americas and engineering, mostly offset by weaker economic conditions in Europe and
South Pacific. Furthermore, Asia volumes declined from lower activity in the electronics end market and
prior year equipment sales.

Comparing to third quarter 2019, underlying sequential sales improved 1%, primarily from timing in the
Engineering business. Note that we continue to experience positive sequential pricing, but the rounding
has resulted in 0%. We have included more detailed information in the appendix, including Slide 10, which
provides 2019 sales by key geography. This information is intended to clarify Linde country exposure and
the overall portfolio mix.

Two points to note on Slide 10 are that gases and engineering account for 84% and 10% of global
sales, respectively, and that the top 12 gas geographies represent over 3/4 of global sales. These top
geographies are comprised of 10 different countries and 2 subregions of Continental Europe.

Referring back to Slide 5. Operating profit of $1.35 billion or 19% of sales, increased 17% from prior year
and resulted in a 250 basis point margin improvement. This margin expansion was largely attributed to
the significant productivity effort from all employees managing local price and cost inflation.

Sequentially, operating profit declined 3%, and operating margin decreased 80 basis points. This decline
was anticipated due to timing of engineering project completions. However, sequential operating margins
increased in all geographic segments, as management actions continued to improve business quality.

Year-over-year EPS improved 25% compared to the 17% increase in operating profit. The difference
relates to how we have been deploying the divestiture proceeds, either to reduce net interest expense or
lower share count.

The balance sheet still has significant cushion versus our target A credit rating. So we have ample dry
powder for both growth investments and distributions back to shareholders.

In fact, you can see that fourth quarter operating cash flow of $2.2 billion is 16% above the third quarter
and represents approximately 105% of fourth quarter EBITDA. Obviously, a very strong cash performance,
which I'll speak to more in the next slide.

CapEx increased 6% sequentially due to base CapEx. This increase was primarily driven by growth
investments that do not meet the backlog criteria, such as small on-site plants.

LINDE PLC FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

And as a reminder, base CapEx represents any capital spending that is not directly listed in the $4.4 billion
sale of gas project backlog. That would include maintenance, replacement and other growth initiatives.

The last figure shows return on capital, which is one of the most important metrics for this industry.
It improved 40 basis points from third quarter and 130 basis points from 2018, due to pricing, cost
management and project contribution over a relatively stable capital base.

Please turn to Slide 6 for further details on 2019 full year cash flow. The left side shows operating cash
flow by quarter, summing to $6.1 billion, including a $0.8 billion outflow related to onetime merger and
restructuring payments. You can see a substantial improvement from the first half, which averaged $1
billion per quarter to the second half, which averaged $2 billion per quarter.

There are 3 primary drivers to this improvement. First, as anticipated, the merger-related cash outflows
reduced from $516 million in the first half to $287 million in the second half. In fact, the fourth quarter
had only $92 million, as we expect this number to continue to decline. Second, there is inherent
seasonality in the cash flows due to timing of cash bonus, tax and interest payments, where first half
has more outflows than the second half. Finally, the improved operating results and working capital
management supported stronger cash flow in the back half of the year.

Looking ahead, I still anticipate full year operating cash flow to EBITDA ratios in the high 70 to low 80
percentile range after adjusting for any merger-related cash outflows.

The combination of the $6.1 billion operating cash flow, $5.1 billion divestiture proceeds and $0.4 billion,
primarily from debt, provide $11.6 billion of capital available for deployment in 2019.

The pie chart to the lower right shows how we allocated that capital, with almost $8 billion going to
shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, including the onetime merger squeeze-out
payment. We also reinvested $4 billion back into the business, with half supporting secured growth.

Overall, the very strong cash generation in 2019, coupled with a disciplined capital allocation process,
enabled us to pursue all opportunities that met our investment criteria, while returning the surplus to
investors.

I'd like to wrap up by reviewing earnings guidance on Slide 7.

Full year 2020 EPS guidance range is $8 to $8.25 or 10% to 13% growth rate when excluding an assumed
1% currency headwind. The key drivers to this range can be found in the bottom left section of the slide.
Incremental productivity initiatives are anticipated to have the greatest impact on EPS growth as we
continue to see opportunities to optimize the base business. Pricing actions, net of cost inflation, will also
deliver incremental earnings. Furthermore, share repurchases and project backlog round up the positive
factors.

Recall that project backlog represents incremental sales and earnings growth, underpinned by long-term
customer contracts with a fixed payment structure.

Note that these top 4 EPS growth drivers are from either management actions or deployed capital, and
thus are independent of macroeconomic or geopolitical effects.

The final factor of base volume in FX would be impacted by the macroeconomic climate, and thus leads to
the most of the variability.

Industrial production and the U.S. dollar average spot rate are the primary indicators. As you can see,
the current guidance range assumes no help from the economy. In fact, it is currently estimated to be a
headwind. Of course, this is just an assumption at this stage. If the economy is better, we will capture that
value, but we believe this assumption is prudent in light of recent economic trends.

For the first quarter, we are estimating EPS in the range of $1.86 to $1.94 or an increase of 11% to 16%,
excluding a 1% currency headwind. This range assumes normal seasonality in addition to headwinds in
our Chinese merchant and package volumes due to the coronavirus outbreak. While it's still too early to

LINDE PLC FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

assess the overall effect of the virus, this range incorporates the most recent estimate of our customers'
impact.

In summary, 2019 marked a successful inaugural year despite only having 10 months since the effective
merger date. 80,000 employees worldwide came together as 1 and worked tirelessly to deliver on our
commitments and integrate 2 great companies into 1.

Looking ahead, we're excited about additional opportunities to create further value through business
optimization, technology sharing and portfolio enhancements. And while the economic outlook may be
unclear, we have confidence in our ability to continue growing earnings per share double digit percent.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

First question, just want to touch on some of the carbon footprint stuff that you highlighted, which is
admirable. But one way to think about it, if you think between now and 2028, you'll probably spend north
of $40 billion in total capital and the capital number you put in there was $1 billion or a little bit more than
$1 billion. Can you kind of rectify those numbers? That's a relatively small percent. Does that signify that
you don't think there's real capital investment in some of these new green technologies or that you're
going to want others? So can you just talk about what that does to your footprint as you move to this
lower carbon aspiration?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Well, yes, the $40 billion, you're just taking $4 billion and extrapolating it over 10 years, that'd be $40
billion, half of that would be large projects. So just about everything we would be talking about in that $1
billion kind of number would be large projects. I do think that there's a very good chance that the number
is going to be larger than that based on the projects that I'm looking at today. They're all in various
stages, some of them are very early stages, but some of the size of the projects are quite significant. So I
think that's a good number to start with, and we'll continue to reevaluate that over time.

Patrick Duffy Fischer
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. And then would you expect the returns on that $1 billion? Or if the number is larger than $1 billion
to be in the same range as what the historic Linde-Praxair was? Or would they get a different discount rate
applied to them?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

No, I expect them to be the same returns. So just got to be clear about that. But if you look at IRR, we
always are looking to earn a good spread above our cost to capital, risk adjusted.

Operator

Our next question comes from Nicola Tang with Exane.

Nicola Tang
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

The first one was on the outlook and the sort of headwinds you're flagging on the base volume and FX
side. I was wondering on the base volume side, could you be more specific in terms of the outlook by
either geography or by specific end markets? I think in your comments, you mentioned the Q1 headwinds
in China, but perhaps you could expand across the regions?

And then the second question was also actually on the sustainability targets. You mentioned the 35%
reduction in greenhouse gases in the next 10 years, could you give us the sort of reference point for your
CO2 equivalent emissions per dollar of EBITDA today?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

LINDE PLC FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

So as far as the volume assumptions, what we're looking at is a weak industrial production, particularly in
Europe. And I think all of you -- or many people here are aware of what the December numbers were in
Germany. I think it was down -- I think it was 3% sequentially and about 7% year-over-year. So declining
industrial production certainly in Europe. In the U.S., industrial production is quite weak today. And then
if I look at the rest of the world, I think clearly, the start for China is not a positive due to some very
unfortunate reasons for them. So I think just based on what we see in the world today, that's kind of our
view. Now I could throw South Pacific in that too. Australia is not doing particularly well. So no matter
where you look around the world, it's a slow IP growth world. And if it does better, we'll certainly be able
to capitalize on that, and it will be reflected in our top line and our bottom line numbers.

With respect to the greenhouse gas, was your question, what is our footprint today? Was that your
question?

Nicola Tang
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Yes. It was, what's the sort of base reference point on CO2 emissions of EBITDA today?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Yes. Well, we published that in our sustainability report. The number is about 40 million metric tons of CO2
equivalent annually. And a big percent of that is what they call scope 2 emissions, which basically means if
you buy electricity and some of that electricity is produced by carbons, that's just what's available on the
grid than as an electrical consumer, you are penalized, so to speak, with that CO2 emission. So that's why
the number ends up being something of that magnitude.

Nicola Tang
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Okay. But it also includes scope 3, is that correct?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

No. Scope 1 and scope 2 includes in that number.

Nicola Tang
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

It doesn't include that, okay.

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Yes.

Operator

And our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Nice end of the year. Steve, you talked about sales synergy is one of the areas that could accelerate in
2020. I don't see that in the EPS drivers, if you will, but is it part of the productivity area? Where does
that show up? And maybe give us a little bit of color on what excites you in terms of the sales synergy
going forward?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

LINDE PLC FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

Yes. It is not on that graph. So we did not attempt to display that. And I said, really kind of coming out
of this year, meaning 2020, I was not referring to 2019, I expected to see more contributions. And what
excites me is, we just had a global leadership conference, we spent a good part of that conference talking
about growth, looking at the combination of applications we have, the strength of our product line portfolio
and the work that's being done to optimize that even further going forward.

I look at decarbonization and what both parties bring to the equation in terms of being able to capitalize
on some of the growth opportunities that will be there, and I talked a little bit about that in my comments.
And then you just kind of get into cross-selling and a lot of other areas that we can take advantage of. So
it is something I'm getting more excited about as I see the potential. I do believe that, I've said before,
it's hard to put a number on it, but I do think we're going to start seeing it coming out this year and going
forward.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Right. And then a quick follow-up in terms of pricing. What are you looking for in 2020? And how much of
that is just pricing from the base business as well as maybe improving the pricing culture on the Linde side
as you head into the 2020?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Well, I think, again, if you look at that little Christmas tree chart that we put together for you. I mean, you
could infer from that, that we're looking at another 2% price in 2020, and I think that's about the right
number at this point. This is something we'll continue to work. It's not a 1 year and done thing. So I think
we're making good progress.

Operator

And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

In your vision for 2020, do you expect volumes to grow on a consolidated basis or no?

Matthew J. White
Executive VP & CFO

Jeff, this is Matt. So right now, when you look at the range that we laid out on the project backlog,
absolutely, yes. When you look at the economic inclusive of the FX, if the FX were 0, the upper end
may have negligible to slightly positive growth. And again, this is just an IP look at this stage. As Steve
mentioned, there are actions to try and grow above IP, even on the base merchant and package with
some of the technology. You may view this outlook is conservative, but this is how we've looked at it at
this point. And that section there is what's driving most of the range at this stage. But rest assured, if the
economy performs better, we will absolutely capture that. Remember, it's a contractual business even in
the merchant and to a large extent, package and we obviously would also be taking appropriate actions
to try and mitigate any down -- decline in various markets. So -- but right now, the view is, is that the
base would be slightly up to negative and then the project contributions will continue to come through as
expected.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. In terms of your, I guess, cost reduction and cash flows, it looks like your cash outflows for
restructuring will drop, I don't know, $400 million next year or something like that. So should your cash
flows benefit by that? In other words, whatever you generated this year in operating cash flow should be
another $400 million, $500 million because of the smaller cash outflows, plus you're going to grow on top

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

LINDE PLC FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

of it. It seems like your cost cutting is ahead of schedule over a 3-year period. Is that right? And -- so
could you comment on that?

Matthew J. White
Executive VP & CFO

So this is Matt, again, Jeff. I can answer the first part of the question. Absolutely, you're right. You are
correct. The $800 million that we had in 2019 will be much lower in 2020. I would say, at least $500
million. Because to your exact point, a lot of the merger costs are behind us on a cash basis. There are
going to be some small ones on some of the final divestitures that occurred here in the back half of the
year. You just have some late either income taxes or payments of invoices. And so that part will have
some effect in the first half, but then from here on out, it'll be mostly restructuring. And I think as it's
been discussed in prior calls, Asia was probably the first out of the gate and corporate Americas. We are
in the midst of some in Europe. So I think you will still see some of that effect going through definitely
through 2020. And possibly, depending upon the economies, could extend it to 2021, that will be to be
determined. But at this stage, from a cash perspective, absolutely would be a decline from 2019 to 2020.

Operator

Our next question comes from Peter Clark with Societe Generale.

Peter Anthony John Clark
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research

I have 2 questions on EMEA, if I can? Obviously, a healthy sequential price again. I'm just wondering,
particularly in terms of the cylinders, how things are going? Because clearly, the added value you can have
through pushing on the cylinder side is probably pretty impressive, I think, when you look at the Linde
portfolio that came in. And then the second one on the synergies, you alluded to this, I think, but it's,
obviously, Asia first out of the gate, a lot of synergies last year, it's probably the biggest kicker regionally.
Would I be right in thinking maybe Europe proportionately produces most on the synergy front in 2020?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Peter. Yes, 3% price year-over-year, another price sequentially. And as you've heard me
say this before, it's always good to be seeing price on a trending basis. 50% of this business is packaged
gases. So you don't move prices that well unless you're doing a good job on a transaction basis in a lot of
-- with a lot of customers.

Yes, the Eastern European business that was -- the old [indiscernible] business is now part of Linde plc, is
a great franchise. I think you appropriately pointed that out.

With respect to productivity, Matt started talking about, yes, Asia was out of the gates quickly, corporate
moved pretty well, Americas moved pretty quickly and EMEA is a little bit slower in terms of addressing
some of the personnel adjustments that are part of the merger. And we knew that coming into this, we
need to work through the European Works Councils, work through the local works councils, and that's
something that we've been doing on a very constructive basis. But there will be more to come as a result
of the negotiations that have taken place to date.

And our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Steve, just on your balance sheet, you entered the year still underlevered, what's your thinking and Matt's
thinking on perhaps leveraging off the balance sheet a little bit more to maybe buy back a little bit more

CEO & Director

I'll let Matt answer that.

Matthew J. White
Executive VP & CFO

So David, you're exactly right. I mean, we are looking for a target rating of A, A2, and our current balance
sheet has significant room to go -- to reach there, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So we ended
the year at a net debt figure of around $11 billion. Clearly, we're going to raise that. My view is probably
$2 billion is kind of a round number that I think we would, at a minimum, look to raise it possibly more.
It depends on conditions, a lot of different conditions. But I think when you look at -- like I mentioned, in
2019, I mean, we were able to distribute and utilize almost $12 billion of capital. So I think we had a good
start, and we were able to -- proceeds were higher-than-anticipated, cash was higher-than-anticipated.
Those are good problems to have. So we probably got a little bit behind on deploying the capital, but that
just gives us more ample dry powder and opportunity as we look forward. So nobody knows what will
happen in the markets, but we will continue to have a very strong balance sheet that we can leverage and
utilize, and that's some -- we'll continue to do.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Perfect. And Steve and Matt, just on the merger cost synergies. I know they're kind of embedded in
productivity. But can you talk about what are the incremental merger cost synergies in 2020 versus '19?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

I don't -- David, I don't really try to separate those out anymore in terms of buckets. I'm just looking
at operating margins, larger productivity buckets. I don't try to distinguish as to whether it came out
of a merger bucket or it came out of the productivity bucket. So to me a cost -- a cost saving is a cost
saving, and that really is the way we're looking at it. And the way you and everybody else will know
that we're accomplishing what we hope to do coming in this merger is if operating margins continue to
expand, and they are. If you -- if I just do the math, with the fourth quarter gas margins [indiscernible]
engineering 20%. So we're starting to make some good progress. I think that's going to continue. Matt
has been talking about cash flow this morning as well, and that's obviously a very good sign that a merger
is working and that the costs are coming out and the cash flow is flowing.

Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Could you touch on 2 things. One, I guess, can you directly address the investor concern about Linde's
ability to pass through carbon prices to the extent that they're enacted in different parts of the world?
And secondly, as you think about the impact of a softer end market environment, is this showing or
accelerating any process to rationalize the broader Linde footprint?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

As far as the footprint itself, I mean, we have spend a lot of time looking at the footprint, we look at all
the countries that we're in as a result of the combination. We look at some of the businesses that we both
have been in that we brought to the merger, and we have plans around all of that. Now some of that takes
time. Usually, it takes longer than I like, but we have a process. We're working through it diligently. We
know what we want to do. I'm not really familiar with the point on not being able to pass through higher
carbon prices. I mean that is something that we have contractually around the world, and we've been
aware that this was something that could happen. I'd say, going back 5 or 6 years, we started making

sure that our contracts had provisions that if there is any environmental legislation of any type that might
cause some type of carbon tax as a result of electricity consumption or making hydrogen and CO2 as the
byproduct or what have you, that we would be able to pass that through and customers accept those
terms.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.

Robert Andrew Koort
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Just wondering if you could talk, Steve, on Slide 7, the Christmas tree, you called it, the drivers of growth
in 2020. How do those look different than what happened in 2019 when you had the slightly higher
earnings growth [indiscernible] the variances year-on-year there in terms of contribution.

Matthew J. White
Executive VP & CFO

Bob, it's Matt. I can probably answer that. I think when you look at the price cost inflation, productivity,
those -- you can look at it either way. Do you put price net of inflation or do you put productivity net of
inflation. But I would say, the combination of those 2 were -- contributed the largest amount. If you want
to call it the management self-help. I think from a backlog perspective, we are expecting more in 2020
than in 2019 due to the start-up range.

Share repurchases. Obviously, we repurchased on a net basis $2.6 billion in 2019, $2.6 billion. Looking
forward, we have ample capacity to do that or more. The base volume FX. FX was quite severe, at
minus 4%, but the base volumes, as you saw, was actually positive at 2%. So that would have created
a negative 2. We are anticipating a worse outlook in 2020 than that. So if '19's macroeconomic was a
repeat in 2020, obviously, that would be a positive for us all around on this assumption. But at this stage
-- again, this is an assumption. We're not projecting that we know the future. We just have an assumption
or trying to lay out the basic guidelines, and we'll manage the business accordingly.

Robert Andrew Koort
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Got it. And Steve, I think you made the comment about looking at your project execution on a risk-
adjusted basis. Your backlog, obviously, is much more tilted to Asia than your current portfolio. Can
you talk about how you look at project return hurdles in Asia relative maybe to the core business that's
generating those 12% returns today?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

We look at them the same way. I mean, it's starting off with what is your cost to capital with the expected
return, adjusting for risks. And when I say risk, I mean, I'll give an example of a very large project with
Samsung that we're starting to start up as we speak. Long-standing customer. I think we all know who
Samsung is. We've had a great relationship with them over years. We have an incumbent position in
several of their locations. They pay in about 25 days. So when I go through the normal assessment of
risk, they come out very well as a low risk, and it's an excellent return. So I don't really look at projects in
Asia any differently than I would look at them in other parts of the world, but it's always important to go
through that risk profile to make sure that what you think is a return that you should get, you'll actually
get it.

LINDE PLC FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

I just want to ask 2 quick questions. First of all, on the green hydrogen comments you made at the very
start of the call, you've got a number of electrolyzer units at the moment. I was wondering if you could
just tell us what the average size of that is? And with the ITM Power investment, where do you think that
could go in the future? And also could you just give us a quick update on how things are in China from
Linde's point of view just in relation to the coronavirus?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Okay. All right. So we have about 80 electrolyzers under operation, about 40 megawatts. So you can do
the math there. A lot of them are quite small. Typical module size today out of ITM is about 2 megawatts.
There are plans to grow that in terms of making larger scale modules, which then can be stacked, and you
can build out the remaining plant equipment and systems around that. I think the number -- it's hard for
me to put a number on what it can be. But I think we're looking at much larger projects going forward,
particularly with some of the industrial customers we're talking to, they have an interest, sincere interest
in moving to green hydrogen and the connected load, the megawatt load would be quite high based on
some of the things I'm looking at. So it's going to grow a lot. Now so what are some of the hurdles? Today,
the cost of electrolysis for producing hydrogen through electrolysis is probably 4x what it would be based
on producing hydrogen from more conventional means, like natural gas-based steam methane reforming.
So there's some work that needs to be done to bring the cost down, scaling up is part of it, more efficient
modules is part of it, lower cost, renewable power is part of that. So we're very much cognizant of that,
and those are things that we're working on. So that will help drive this marketplace, the ability to bring
those costs down. Of course, if government steps in and provides some of that difference, that would help
it move more quickly.

To China and coronavirus. We have about 2,600 people in China. In the Wuhan region, we have about 1%
of our people are in Wuhan. We have very small operations there today. So with respect to Wuhan, we're
not dramatically affected. No -- fortunately, as of today, no one of our 2,600 employees nor any of our
employees around the world have a confirmed -- have been confirmed with coronavirus. So we're very
pleased to hear that. We provide aid as a corporation to our Chinese team, and much of that is flowing
to Wuhan. We prioritize the flow of key products that are needed to fight this virus, like oxygen, medical
gases. And obviously, we've been watching the situation very closely from a business standpoint. On-site
customers have not really shown much of an effect, not yet. The merchant liquid, to give you an example,
in a typical year during lunar new year, merchant liquid capacity would probably drop to about 30%.
Rather than seeing 1 week of that this year, we saw 2 weeks and they're slowly coming back from that.
And as Matt explained early on, we've accounted for that.

Certainly, based on what we know about the virus, we've accounted for that in our guidance. So that's the
situation. Tough situation for the people there, but they're working through it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just a question on backlog dynamics. I mean, Steve, you've talked about the slowing macroeconomic
activity and I think in the past, we've talked about maybe a deceleration in sort of the urgency around
project signing. So I'm just curious, are you seeing anything changing in terms of the opportunity set
that's out there or the counterparties' desire to move forward?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

I would still characterize it as not a lot of hurry. People are not in a lot of hurry to get projects closed.
The proposal rate on large projects is low. Most of what we're looking at is in the smaller range, say,
$50 million, maybe up to $100 million, maybe a little bigger than that, but nothing over $250 million.
I think that's just reflective of kind of where we are as an economy. But if I were to kind of try to look

LINDE PLC FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

downstream in terms of what I think could happen with respect to the backlog, I believe that the U.S.
Gulf Coast is still advantaged with low-cost natural gas that's still going to continue to attract, especially
chemical customers. I think we could see some growth, more growth with hydrogen in places like the
U.S. Gulf Coast, but not restricted to that. As a result of IMO 2020, some of the decarbonization projects
that we're working on, again, some of them are fairly large, but it will be interesting to see how quickly
they evolve and develop, but that could be additive to the backlog. And then I think you have to look at
electronics, though it's been in a lull this past -- during the second half of 2019 and especially in the fourth
quarter, I think the long-term trends are very positive.

So this lower nanometer geometry, artificial intelligence, 5G, this EUD technology that Samsung and
others have been adopting, and I think that will drive stronger electronics demand going forward and
could result in increased adding projects to the backlog.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And just a follow-up on the CapEx for 2020. If my math's correct, it's down versus 2019, and I
know part of the reduction is probably the synergies -- the CapEx synergies that you guided to, but maybe
you could just bridge the '19 and '20 CapEx for us in terms of what the differential is?

Matthew J. White
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Vincent, it's Matt. You're absolutely right. If you break it down between the project and between the
base CapEx, we absolutely are expecting probably 100, 200 kind of synergies that we would anticipate to
see on a year-over-year basis. And realize, as stated, in that base, there are small growth projects like
the 30 VPSAs that we had recently announced. So when we can get those, we'll take those all day long,
so they can cause some quarterly number movement. But in the end of the day, we definitely anticipate
some synergies in that line. As far as the project, frankly, the bigger that number is, the happier I am
because that means we're ahead on our project schedule. So that one is pretty much just lockstep with
our engineering project outlooks in terms of timing of construction. But those are, as you can imagine,
very tightly managed on a project basis from our engineering team, and that's something that we'll just
continue to build to our schedules.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

A couple of questions, sticking with the project backlog. Steve, in your prepared remarks, I think you
made a comment that you won practically every project that you chose to pursue. And so if activity
remains sufficient, does that suggest that you may have upside to push the envelope and increase returns
above the current rate of 11.6%?

And then my second question is more specific on your engineering backlog. Looks like that increased
$800 million or so sequentially. On Slide 14, you referenced the Amur project. Just wondering if you could
comment on that project specifically? And what impact you would expect that to have on the helium
market. And whether you can pull some more helium off of that yourselves?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Yes. So all the projects that we're starting up are going to be accretive to return on capital. So it's 11.6%,
I believe, that's the number that you're looking at. And of course, I'm looking at internal rate of return
when I look at these projects, unlevered after-tax internal rate of return above the cost to capital. But
after a few years, these projects are typically already accretive to ROC and then over time, they're
definitely accretive to ROC.

LINDE PLC FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 13, 2020

So I would say that we look at just about every project. In fact, I always encourage my teams to bring
all the projects forward, and we'll take a look at and we'll decide whether or not we think they're worth
participating. But the criteria we use is pretty straightforward. It has to fit our strategy as a company, and
it has to have a good return above cost to capital, as I described earlier. And we're going to maintain that
twin criteria, but we do want to look at practically everything that's out there.

With respect to the Linde Engineering, yes, the backlog numbers are up for sure. The Amur project is not
related to helium. The Amur project is a mixed feed cracker for Sibur and so that's not related to what
you're thinking about. But there is -- there are natural gas plants for gas [indiscernible] that are being
built and starting up that will be -- we'll have helium online, I would say, the second half of next year is
when you would start to see the impact from them.

Operator

Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

With regard to the base CapEx, what portion of that is actually tied to revenue-generating projects versus
kind of the more normal maintenance or efficiency type projects?

Matthew J. White
Executive VP & CFO

John, this is Matt. That's not a number we disclose. But I can tell you, it's a meaningful part of that
number, and it's something we evaluate. But as you can imagine, when you get into things like
transportation, cylinder, storage equipment, tanks, it gets a very fine line, what is growth, what is
replacement. So this is something internally we spend a lot of time on, but it's just not a number
externally that we disclose. But I can tell you, unlike VPSAs and those type of plants that we've
announced, they are under $5 million a spend, but they're in the upper end. So they're $4 million to $5
million, sometimes they could be a little lower. So those would be included in this number as well.

John Patrick McNulty
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. And I guess, when you think about the returns on those projects versus kind of the more base or
the more kind of big project pipeline, how do the returns compare?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Well, they're very solid. The configuration of a typical small on-site project is, it's 100% facility fee. So
-- and they're easy to construct. So I've always liked these small on-site projects. I'm excited about the
capability that we now have between the 2 companies. We have every offering covered now in small on-
site, and it's something that we're very much focused on as a company, very strong, 100% kind of take-
or-pay commercial contracts. They are easier to construct, much simpler configuration. So all you have to
do really is select the right customer.

Martin, I'd prefer not to get into specifics about which companies that we're looking at divesting. And
you will -- I just -- all I'm going to say is really we're pretty active as we look at add businesses and
geographies that we don't think belong in our portfolio long term from a strategic standpoint. And you'll
hear more about that as the year progresses.

Martin Roediger
Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division

And the second question is on the sustainability topics. Can you help us to understand how much short
you are in terms of certificates when it comes to the European trading scheme? And do you think your
actions to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity will help you to be better prepared for the Phase IV in the
European trading scheme, i.e., that you are not short anymore in emission certificates?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Well, I don't know exactly how the trading scheme is going to work at this point. I believe that these are
management targets. So we decided as a team, these are things that we wanted to go after. As I said
earlier, renewable power has a lot to do. The availability of renewable power has a lot to do with what our
emissions profile ultimately looks like. And the sooner the world converts to renewable, the much better
off we will be. We're going to be very active in terms of going out and contracting for renewable power.
And that's how you're able to increase purchases from $1 billion to $2 billion.

But as far as reaching carbon neutrality at some point in the future, there are other things that would
need to happen beyond 100% renewable power, we would need, I think, a very strong carbon tax around
the world. We need advancements in technology. All things that can be achieved, but they just take a
longer time frame.

And our final question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

Steve, you noted some slowing in electronics markets in Asia, I think that a number of players in the
semiconductor space are encouraged that we're starting to see a recovery. So can you just talk about
what you were seeing kind of in the second half and particularly in Q4 and maybe comment on your
outlook for 2020 in electronics?

Stephen F. Angel
CEO & Director

Yes. So as you know, there are big inventory builds and memory chips, prices dropped precipitously.
Samsung did not have best quarter they've ever had when they announced here recently. So that is what's
-- that's really been in the news, I think, the last several quarters in 2019. Most people think that it will
be better, that this bottom is that it's going to improve in 2020, and it's going to improve based on a lot
of the trends that I mentioned earlier. So I don't have a number for you, but I think it should be better in
2020. And certainly, when we start up some of these big projects, that will be quite additive.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

And then I wanted to also ask you about the Americas. You commented that manufacturing and metals
end markets were weaker. Talk about what you're seeing in hard goods versus packaged gases? And also
maybe comment on the new trade agreements that are in place. Any sense that those could have some
positive impact on manufacturing and metals in the U.S. during 2020?

is down high single digits, whereas gas is flat. So clearly, hard goods is feeling the effect. Gas not nearly
so much so. Looking forward to the year with respect to trade agreements, I think, to the extent that we
supply large capital equipment, export companies that will have some positive effect. I quite frankly don't
think it's going to be a huge number, but it could have some positive effects.
