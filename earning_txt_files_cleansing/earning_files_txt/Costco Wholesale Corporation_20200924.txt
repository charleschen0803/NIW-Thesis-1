Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Costco Q4 earnings call. [Operator
Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to Richard Galanti. Please go ahead.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Thank you, Laurie, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will
include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or
performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties
include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to
time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak
only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements,
except as required by law.

In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020, the 16
and 52 weeks ended August 30. Reported net income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.389 billion or
$3.13 per diluted share compared to $1.097 billion or $2.47 a share -- per diluted share last year in the
fourth quarter.

This year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by incremental expense related to COVID-19 premium
wages and sanitation costs totaling $281 million pretax or $0.47 a share, as well as a $36 million pretax
charge or $0.06 per share related to early payment of $1.5 billion of debt. These items were partially
offset by an $84 million pretax benefit or $0.15 a share for the partial reversal of a reserve of $123 million
pretax, $0.22 per diluted share related to our product tax assessment taken in the fourth quarter of last
year.

Net sales for the quarter increased 12.5% to $52.28 billion, up from $46.45 billion in the fourth quarter a
year earlier. For the fiscal year in its entirety, fiscal 2020 came in at $163.22 billion, a 9.3% increase over
the $149.35 billion in fiscal 2019.

Comparable sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were as follows: on a reported basis for the 16
weeks, U.S. was 11%. Excluding gas deflation and FX, U.S. was 13.6%. Canada reported 9.1% up. Again,
ex gas deflation and FX, 12.6% up. Other international reported 16.1%, ex gas deflation and FX, 18.8%,
bringing the total company to a reported number of 11.4% comp, and again, ex gas deflation and FX, up
14.1%. For the company, e-commerce reported was 90.6% up. And ex gas and FX, 91.3% up.

In terms of the fourth quarter comp sales metrics, foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively
impact sales by about 50 basis points, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by
approximately 220 basis points. Traffic or shopping frequency on a worldwide basis was down 1.2% during
the fourth quarter and showed an increase of 1.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction, our average
basket size was up 12.7% during the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the negative impacts from gas
deflation and FX, which are included in that number.

We've kept you up-to-date in our monthly sales calls on the impacts from the pandemic as we've been
able to identify those. Overall merchandise sales in the core, core being food and sundries, hardlines,
softlines and fresh, as well as pharmacy, have all been strong, while sales in our ancillary, other ancillary
and travel businesses, though now open, have been soft.

Next, moving down the income statement, membership fee income. We reported a fourth quarter
membership fee income of $1.106 billion, up $56 million from $1.05 billion in the fourth quarter of '19.
The $56 million increase ex FX would have been $60 million up. During the quarter, we opened 8 net

new units and 13 for the entire fiscal year. In terms of renewal rates, at fourth quarter end, our U.S. and
Canada renewal rate remained at 91.0%. And worldwide rate also remained at its similar number from a
quarter ago at 88.4%.

In terms of the number of members at Q4 end, both member households and cardholders, total paid
households at fourth quarter end was up -- was -- came in at 58.1 million and cardholders, 105.5 million.
In the fourth quarter, we standardized the membership count methodology globally, which we'd apparently
done differently in different markets, North America versus others, and so that increase includes that
slight adjustment. The change resulted in adding approximately 1.3 million paid members and 2.0 million
cardholders to our member base.

So as an example, from Q3 to Q4 when we showed going from 55.8 million to 58.1 million or up 2.3
million, that 2.3 million increase includes the 1.3 million adjustment upwards. Similarly, the 3.7 million
increase from the end of third quarter to fourth quarter, that 3.7 million increase includes 2.0 million of an
adjustment. I'd like to note, however, that neither the membership fee income dollars nor the renewal rate
calculations were affected by this adjustment. At fourth quarter end, paid executive memberships totaled
22.6 million, an increase of 765,000 during the 16 weeks since third quarter end.

Going down the gross margin line -- going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin came
in at 11.24%, up 18 basis points from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 11.06%. That 18 basis
point increase, excluding gas deflation, came in what would have been minus 4 basis points, and excluding
a portion of the direct COVID expenses would have been up 8%, and I'll show you that in the numbers
that I ask you to jot down here.

If you jot down the following numbers, 2 columns. First column will be fourth quarter as reported. Second
column will be fourth quarter ex gas deflation. The first line item would be core merchandise. Year-over-
year on a reported basis, core merchandise was up 101 basis points; ex gas deflation, up 82 basis points,
so plus 101 and plus 82 in the first line item. Ancillary businesses being the second line item reported
minus 66 basis points, and without gas deflation, minus 71; 2% reward, minus 4 and minus 2 basis
points; other, minus 13 and minus 13 basis points, and that would give you totals on a reported basis of
plus 18 basis points, which I mentioned, and ex gas deflation, the minus 4.

Now the core merchandise component of gross margin again was higher by 101 basis points year-over-
year and 82 basis points higher ex gas deflation. Similar to last quarter and even more dramatic of an
impact during this quarter, we had a significant sales shift from ancillary and other businesses to the core.
This resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations
versus last year.

Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own sales, so core-on-core, if you will,
margins year-over-year were up by 70 basis points. Fresh foods was the biggest driver of the year. With
the strong sales in fresh, we benefited from efficiency gains in both labor productivity and significantly
lower, what we call, D&D or damage and destroyed or products spoilage. Food and sundries, softlines,
hardlines, as well, as I mentioned, fresh foods already, but in addition, food and sundries, softlines and
hardlines, all had higher margins year-over-year in the quarter as well.

Ancillary and other businesses gross margin again was lower by 66 basis points and 71 basis points ex
gas deflation. Most of the -- our ancillary businesses were lower year-over-year, with the most significant
negative impact coming from gasoline and travel, which accounted for about 3/4 of the decline. Costco
Logistics, which was primarily our acquisition this past March of the big and bulky last-mile carrier called
Innovel, that was our newly acquired business. That impacted ancillary margins by minus 8 basis points.
Again, we acquired this, this past March and we anticipated losses in this business as it ramps up. Note
that these losses do not take into account any added sales from expanded product offerings, lower
delivery prices and improved member satisfaction.

Next, 2% Reward, nothing really to say there, minus 2 basis points ex gas deflation. And other, the minus
13 basis points, nearly all of this is attributable to the costs from COVID, $64 million of the $281 million
previously mentioned. These are direct costs for incremental wages and sanitation allocated to our cost
departments and to our merchandise fulfillment operations so it impacts cost of sales.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was lower or better by 47 basis points,
coming in at 9.62% of sales this year in the fourth quarter versus 10.09% last year in the fourth quarter.
Ex gas deflation, SG&A was lower or better by 66 basis points.

Again, if you jot down the following 2 columns of numbers. First column is reported year-over-year SG&A
change and the second column would be ex gas deflation. Core operations as reported were better or
lower by 42 basis points and ex gas deflation, lower or better by 57 basis points, so plus 42 and plus 57;
central plus 1 and plus 3; stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 4; other, plus 1 and plus 2. And that gives
you the total on a reported basis SG&A being better by 47 basis points and ex gas deflation being better
by 66.

SG&A in the core, excluding COVID-related expenses, which I'll discuss in a moment, was significantly
leveraged, of course, with a strong core merchandise sales increases. As I mentioned, central stock
compensation showing small improvements year-over-year as a percent of sales. And now the other plus 1
and -- plus 1 basis point reported and plus 2 ex gas deflation, as I discussed earlier in the call, the quarter
was positively impacted by an $84 million reversal of last year's fourth quarter $123 million pretax reserve
related to a product tax assessment taken a year ago in the fourth quarter.

The net impact from this item was plus 43 basis points. That plus 43 basis points is in this plus 1 and plus
2 basis point number. Also included in other are the incremental COVID costs or $217 million of the $281
million total amount. That equates to 42 or 41 basis points without gas deflation, offsetting it the other
way. So that's why you have a very small number in that line. Again, these are the cost for incremental
wages and safety and sanitation.

Next on the income statement, preopening expense. Preopening expense last year in the fourth quarter
was $41 million. This year in the fourth quarter, it was $15 million less, coming in at $26 million. Last year
in the fourth quarter, we had 12 gross openings, 10 net and 2 relos, and that compares to 10 openings
gross or 8 net in the fourth quarter of this year. The big difference in those 2 numbers, this year's fourth
quarter relates primarily to warehouses opened during the quarter as well as warehouses scheduled to
open in the first quarter. Last year's preopening included $12 million in preopening expenses related to our
new -- our then new poultry complex.

All told, reported operating income in Q4 increased 32%, coming in at $1,929,000,000 this year compared
to $1,463,000,000 last year. And it would be a slightly higher percent increase if you excluded the items
that I had mentioned earlier.

Below the operating income line, interest expense was higher year-over-year by $6 million, coming in at
$51 million this year compared to $45 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was
lower by $83 million year-over-year. As discussed earlier, following the completion of the debt offering,
we prepaid $1.5 billion of debt during the quarter. There was a pretax expense of -- or what's known as
a make-whole payment of $36 million related to the early retirement of that debt. That's in this interest
income and other line.

Actual interest income was lower by $28 million lower -- it was actually lower by $28 million year-over-
year in the quarter due principally to lower interest rates being realized. And lastly, FX and other was
lower by $19 million.

Overall, reported pretax income in the fourth quarter was up -- came in higher by 25%, coming in at
$1.869 billion this year compared to $1.492 billion last year. Again, these exclude those items I point --
that's including those items I pointed out earlier. In terms of the income tax rate, our tax rate in Q4 of '20
was 24.9%, a little lower than a year ago when it was at 25.7% in the fourth quarter a year ago, so a little
benefit there.

A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, with COVID, we had some delays in some of
the planned openings for the fiscal year that just ended this past August 30, and a few of those have been
pushed into this year that we're in now. In the -- for the year, we opened 16 total units, including 3 relos.
So last year, we opened a net increase of 13 locations. Our plans for this year is to open about 20 net,

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

23, including 3 relos. That's our best guess and plan at this point. And as of Q4 end, our total warehouse
square footage stood at 116 million square feet.

In terms of capital expenditures, for the 16-week fourth quarter, we spent approximately $852 million,
and the full year, we spent $2.8 billion. Our estimated CapEx for all of fiscal '21 is in the $3 billion to $3.2
billion range.

E-commerce. Overall, our e-commerce sales, as you've seen each month, have increased nicely. For the
fourth quarter on a reported basis, up 90.6%, and ex FX, 91.3% increase during the fourth quarter. A few
of the stronger departments, and there are several, health and beauty aids, food and sundries, appliances,
TVs, computers and tablets, housewares and small electrics. Total online grocery grew a very strong
rate in Q4, several hundred percent. This e-commerce comp, if you will, that number -- the e-commerce
numbers I just mentioned above follow our usual convention, which we exclude the third-party same-day
grocery program. If we included that third-party same-day, our e-commerce comps result would have
been approximately 120% up during the quarter.

Overall, our e-comm sites were relatively smoothly during the quarter despite the dramatic volume
increases, and we were able to improve our delivery times throughout -- on delivery times throughout the
quarter as we adjusted to the ramped-up order volumes.

Now quickly turning to COVID and the coronavirus and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it.
From a sales perspective, as indicated by our past 3 monthly sales releases, we've enjoyed strong sales
results during the June, July and August time frame. Certainly, the sales strength starts with our being
deemed essential, resulting in strong sales of fresh foods, and foods and sundries, and health and beauty
aids and the like.

We've also benefited from the much improved sales and products and items for the home outside of
the food area. As people are spending less on travel, air and hotel and dining out, they seem to have
redirected at least some of those dollars to categories like lawn and garden, furniture and mattresses,
exercise equipment, bicycles, housewares, cookware, domestics and the like. And lastly, a few of our
ancillary businesses, notably our optical and hearing aid operations, were closed for 12 to 16 weeks and
reopened during the mid-summer.

From a supply chain perspective, kind of a 40,000-foot view, in terms of China, at least judging by the
shipments to us, most of the factories are up and running. There are still some production challenges due
to certain components downstream in the supply chain in areas like electronics, computer and certain
white goods. It is getting better and improving each week. And like us, we feel that our suppliers' factories
have gotten a bit better over the last several months of instituting safety protocols. That's our best guess.

And in terms of getting back to normal, each week is showing improvement and catching up, still a little
behind. Food and sundries, some limits on paper goods but getting better. Toughest area overall is still
sanitizing wipes as well as latex gloves. In terms of other PP&E, we're in pretty good shape, selling quite a
bit of masks and the like. Milk and butter, things like that are generally okay.

In terms of fresh foods, proteins are currently all pretty good. There had been some slowdowns over the
past few months and some allocations and some limits that we had to put on some sales of those items,
but that's gotten back to normal at this point. Seafood and produce, all good as it has generally been
throughout.

In terms of holiday merchandise planning, Halloween, a few -- a small reduction in the amount of
costumes, some more basic candy items as well as for Christmas going a little more basic in some areas
and as well as looking at things and needs and uses for the house, but viewing it, given our strength of
late, relatively optimistically.

And Costco travel has shown some very modest improvement but still significantly impacted during the
quarter due to reduced demand. We do see our members starting to book travel again although generally
further out than we have historically seen.

Our warehouses overall have remained open and are back to regular hours, with additional -- with an
additional hour on certain weekday mornings and many markets for seniors and persons with disabilities.
The warehouses are still, of course, following the social distancing and sanitation guidelines -- sanitization
guidelines. And since May 4, as you know, we've required all members and employees in the warehouse to
wear masks.

Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results, which is for the 5
weeks ending Sunday, October 4, on that following Wednesday, October 7, after market close.
With that, I will open it up to Q&A and give it back to Laurie. Thank you.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Richard, my first question is, how should we think about or how are you planning COVID costs for Q1 of
the next fiscal year? And if I'm not mistaken, I thought that for this fourth quarter, there was a range --
I don't know if there was a range, but we were expecting them to be lower sequentially and I think they
were pretty similar. So you mentioned the basics, what it constituted, but can you talk about why?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Sure. As you may recall, on our third quarter conference call, we indicated that such types of costs in the
Q4 would be at least $100 million or over $100 million, and of course, $281 million is over $100 million,
but quite a bit larger. But the reality is, the biggest factor is we chose to continue, at least for the time
being, the $2 an hour premium. That represents about $14 million a week. To date, we are doing that and
we've committed to doing that at least through, I believe, the first 8 weeks of fiscal -- of this fiscal quarter.

And again, we'll take that time and again. Our numbers have been very good. Our employees are on the
front line. And so that -- mind you, the fourth quarter was a 16-week quarter versus Q3, which was a 12-
week quarter so on a per week basis, it's come down. There's other things that have been -- that won't be
repeated in the first quarter, at least.

If you go back to the very beginning of time, for the first 4 to 5 weeks when we stopped doing food
samples, we employed those third-party employees ourselves. We paid our third party to have them help
us in the warehouse. That was during those 3 to 4 weeks of craziness in late February to mid- to late
March when people were coming in and hoarding and what have you, and that helped quite a bit.

So there's some costs that have -- that I don't expect to be continued. The biggest component, of course,
would be the $2 premium. And we'll see. At this juncture, we've committed to it our employees for the
first 8 weeks of this quarter.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. My follow-up is you mentioned the holiday, and I think you said you're looking at it optimistically
or favorable for now. Can you talk about maybe a little more detail why? It seems like the results speak
for themselves for now, but there could be a lot of change over the next couple of months. And has
your customer diversified their basket with you? And you think you'll be able to retain them across more
categories and keep trips as more retail gets their traffic back?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Sure. Sure. Well, look, I mean, the main data points that we look at is, is how strong things have been
in the last 3.5, 4 months. June, July and August sales results, which we've all shared with you guys, the
trend in traffic has improved so it's been positive the last couple of months instead of slightly or even
more than slightly negative going back to April and May. While the average ticket or average basket size
has continued to be relatively strong.

So -- and probably if you ask what's -- what are the -- what's some of the biggest surprises that we had
looking at the last 3 months of sales results compared to what we had expected a few months before that.
I mean, the big surprise is, is we expected fresh and food and sundries and paper goods and the like and
health and beauty aids to be strong, particularly food because of the weakness -- people dining out. But I

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

think we're a little surprised by the strength in many of these discretionary nonfood categories, things for
the house and big-ticket items.

Again, not only furniture for the -- inside the house but patio furniture. Live goods were particularly
strong, where, in some instances, we had try to cut back a few orders back in March and April for seasonal
summer goods like patio furniture. Very quickly, we were having to scramble for more of those. And so, so
far, so good.

We recognize that people were coming into Costco. We believe they feel safe, given the safety protocols
and the mask requirements. The sheer size of the building itself and the width of the aisles. So all those
things have helped us in that regard.

We're also back to, after a couple of months of not having our traditional multi-vendor mailer coupon type
of offerings, because several key items were limited or on allocation, we've gotten back to that. And so I
think our -- at least our most recent 3-plus month history has given us some comfort at this point.

Now as soon as I say that, things may change. But at this juncture, we feel very good about how will we
-- what it looks like going forward, recognizing, looking at some of these things with a more basic in terms
of Halloween and Christmas and the like.

Operator

Your next question is from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So my first question is, what's driving that strong core-on-core margin outside of the fresh category, which
clearly would benefit from a shrink perspective? Is it sell-through and low clearance? Is it mix within the
categories? Or is it something else?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, on fresh, it's all of the above. I mean, it's strong sales on a relatively higher initial margin business
within our small confines of margin range. But then 2 components of cost of sales in fresh is labor
productivity and spoilage. We don't have spoilage. We sell out, not literally, but almost literally to the piece
on these end things and so you're not throwing stuff away. You're not -- there's -- it's a great business
from a gross margin dollar perspective, given the sales strength in it. So that's clearly the biggest thing.

But again, if you look at the other 3 core areas, core food and sundries, hardlines and softlines, they're all
up but up a nice amount but nothing like fresh foods. So that's helped.

Now mind you, other things have offset that and the sum of all of those things is still a positive. The things
that have offset it would be things like the fact that certain ancillary businesses, which are higher-margin
businesses, were closed for a 12- to 16-week period. Our food court, of course, has been limited of what
we do there. We took out all the tables. We've limited their product offerings.

Travel, which is -- while a small business, is an extreme example of high margin. Many items in travel
is just a brokerage fee. It's almost sales minus no cost of sales equal gross margin, if you will. It's the
markup or the commission on some of that stuff, a portion of that.

So those things have come down, but the sum of all those negatives are outweighed by the overall
strength in core merchandise sales. And pharmacy, pharmacy has been relatively strong, too. And within
that, fresh has been the biggest driver of it.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. So a follow-up question that you were surprised by the negative gas impact in ancillary. I mean,
your peers, while not the same quarter, saw tailwinds for the periods that crossed over. And so can you

10

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

talk about how much of that 66 basis points is specifically gas versus the other businesses? And as you
look forward, considering that opticals open and food courts, at least for the smaller menu, open and
starting to see some traction around travel and gas prices being stable, do you expect that at this point
that, that ancillary headwind could abate?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

I think it will be less negative, but I think it's going to be around for a while. I mean, if you look at gas,
gas is more profitable per dollar -- per gallon of sales than it was a couple of years ago, because I think
if prices have come down, traditional retail has not been as competitive, which allows us to be more
competitive, but still make a little more. And it's -- and our trough at the lowest point, I'm guessing, back
in April and May, there was a week where we -- our gallons were down close to half.

Today, they're down closer to maybe down 10%, maybe 5% to 15% depending on the day or the week.
But in normal times, for the last few years pre-COVID, when the U.S. gasoline industry had comps in the
very low single digits, we'd be in the very, very high single digits or close to 10% or 11% even sometimes.

So we've -- so things have changed there. It's still a profitable business. And -- but when your sales --
when your price per gallon goes down 20%, 30% and your gallons are down even some small amount,
and it's a 10-plus percent of sales of our business, it has that effect on it. At the end of the day, the sum
of all of this has still been quite good for us.

Christopher Michael Horvers

And could you break out that -- the 66 that's specifically related to gas?

Richard A. Galanti

And your next question is from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Curious, Richard, how you're thinking about the recovery of your gasoline business, particularly from a
gallons perspective. And I guess, how this interplay is holding back foot traffic into your store. Clearly, it's
getting better but it's being impacted a little bit by the gas business.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

Well, I don't know exactly. I haven't seen numbers in the last week or 2, but I believe our, call it, 10%
negative gallon comp is still way better than the U.S. as a whole -- the U.S. gallon -- gasoline industry as
a whole. And so -- but we'd rather have plus 10% to minus 10%. The fact is, is that people are coming in
less but they're buying more each time, and the sum of those 2 things, as we've shown, we used to enjoy
5% to 8% comps pre-COVID on a regular basis. And the last 3 months, we've enjoyed 14s, if you will. And
so overall, we'll take that. But it's got to be a small impact still.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay. And then just it's been a while since I asked this, but the crossover between customers that
purchase gas and then shop in the store on like kind hours, do you have that number handy?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

I haven't seen it lately, but historically, it had been -- during the hours that the warehouse itself is open
because the gas station is open a couple of hours perhaps on either side of that, it's in the low 50s.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Low 50s. Okay, great. And then just switching gears a little bit on capital allocation. You ended the year
with over $30 per share in cash and cash equivalents, and you obviously remain significantly under-
levered. Curious how you and the Board are approaching this high-class problem?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, we have our regular quarterly Board meeting in a couple of weeks, we'll see. But at the end of the
day, we talk about it every Board meeting, all the different alternatives. Certainly, we -- when we went out
to borrow the $4 billion, which was really a net increase of $2.5 billion because we used $1.5 billion to pay
off existing debt, the fact was is that we were planning for a worst-case scenario where we would need
more -- there'd be a slew of seasonal summer merchandise that we might have to hold for a year, as well
as there'd be a lower inventory turn, particularly on discretionary nonfood categories.

Up until June, when we've seen the numbers really go in the northern way, June, July and August, much
of that need has not occurred. So yes, we are in a good position right now. We'll continue to look at it. But
you'll know this after we know.

your next question is from Karen Short of Barclays.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I guess, first question, just on the $2 premium. I guess, the real question is, I mean, I know you called
out the 8 weeks, but would it be more prudent, as we kind of model this, to just kind of think that that's
more or less the new norm? Meaning $14 million a week is kind of what we should add on, on an ongoing
basis? It just seems that it's hard to take something like that away once you've offered it. So just thoughts
on that.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

I don't think it's completely hard to take away. We communicate via our CEO and our Head of HR to our
employees. We've done that and we've continued to extend it but saying this will be it and then we've
added a little more.

have to wait and see, Karen.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then I wanted to just...

Richard A. Galanti

I wouldn't necessarily budget it in for the full fiscal year, but we don't know at this point. We know it's at
least 8 of the 12 weeks in Q1 and it may be more.

Karen Fiona Short
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just back to traffic for a second. So within your reported traffic numbers is obviously e-
comm, right? So I wanted to just ask a little about what your physical in-store traffic looks like? And then
I think on the last call, you were asked on color on traffic with your more loyal executive members versus
the lower level members. Do you have any color on both of those?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Looking real quick. I really -- I don't have color in terms of -- generally, I mean, executive members do
everything, spend more -- come in more frequently, buy more each time and renew at a higher rate.

I'm looking real quick here, hold on. I don't have traffic. Comps -- within our comp number, e-commerce
benefits it by a little over 3%.

out.

Operator

And your next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So Richard, now that we're 6 months into the pandemic, does Costco come out of this situation in better
position to experience incremental margin expansion over time? And is there any factors that you've
learned that would allow the company to generate more margin expansion than it would have otherwise?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, the more margin we can generate, the more likely we're going to give some of it back. In this case,
arguably, given our strength, we've certainly given it back, but we've remained very competitive, but
we've also maintained that $2 premium to our employees, which we appreciate.

I -- the first part of your question when you started asking about how do we feel we're going to come out
of the pandemic and as things change? I mean, look, there's factors, as people eat out more and go out
more or travel more, there's less for the home, that's on a macro basis. We have to believe here and we
do believe that we have picked up new members. We've picked up sales from existing members, from
categories that they're buying more at Costco now, relatively speaking, in part because certain other
venues or traditional venues are either closed or not frequently -- not frequent as often.

So again, we've been blessed in that regard. I think the other thing that I've witnessed over the last
several months is our merchants' ability to pivot and to add items for the houseware items, additional
items. And so I think net of all those things, I still think, on a macro basis, when people start eating out
more and start flying more and attending -- going on vacations, some of these monies that are now being
used for purchasing things for the home is going to move that way.

That being said, I think there are several areas where we've -- we're retaining more of their dollars, and
some portion of that will continue to retain when it gets back to normal.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And on an unrelated note, looking at e-commerce growth, what percentage of your membership
base is currently buying from you online? What's the profile of the member who's driving the growth? And
presumably, a lot of the spend is incremental because the spend of those numbers is going up. Could that
change how you are thinking about emphasizing or investing behind your e-commerce business?

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

Yes. I don't have all those specifics. What I know is what was happening even before COVID and has
been exacerbated in a positive way since COVID is more -- some members have signed up to utilize those
services. More members are utilizing those services and spending more on it. If you think about the 1-
day fresh, it is up several hundred percent-fold, recognizing it was a smaller base, even as it's gone down
from its peak a couple or 3 months ago, it's still a lot higher than it was before. And my guess is even as
people get used to wanting to go out, there's some people right now that aren't going to the supermarket
or aren't going out to Costco to shop. They love this service.

There are some people that are going to -- there's going to be some group of people going to like that.
And given our quality and value, we and the supermarket are not mutually exclusive of one another, and
we think we'll keep some of that. So we are certainly doing more to market to members, not only in-store
promotions, but online promotions as well.

Robert E. Nelson
Senior Vice President of Financial Planning & Investor Relations

We feel better too on offerings [indiscernible].

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Yes. We feel -- I feel better about our offerings today certainly than a year ago or than 2 years ago,
recognizing there's a lot of low-hanging fruit because some of the things we hadn't done historically. We
know that on the -- I'll hate to use the phrase again, but on the big and bulky side, a lot of those things
-- yes, for 4 years, we had talked, which is pre-COVID, we talked about going from $50 million in white
goods sales in store in the U.S. with a limited sales penetration, if you will, to fiscal '19 doing almost $700
million, I think, just under $700 million.

That business has increased at a more rapid pace than the last year for 2 reasons: COVID and people
buying things for the home as well as, in our view, the original things we're seeing trends-wise in terms of
how to utilize -- better utilize our big and bulky Innovel acquisition, what we call now -- what we now call
Costco Logistics for big-ticket furniture items, lawn and garden items, exercise equipment and the like.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Paul Lejuez of Citi.

Paul Lawrence Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Paul Lejuez. Richard, can you maybe talk about what you're seeing in terms of spending by new customers
relative to existing customers, but also relative to what you would typically see from a new customer? And
then second, I guess I'm curious if you have looked at club usage by members at all. What percent of your
members used the club this quarter versus last quarter? Any way to frame that?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

I don't know if I can answer all those specifically, but keep in mind, some of our new members signed up
simply for same-day fresh or 2-day dry. Same-day fresh, you have to be within a market -- a trade area
where there's a Costco; 2-day dry, you can be anywhere, I think, almost anywhere in the United States;
and with Instacart, it's both United States and a good part of Canada now.

And so we have some members, if they weren't a member but they're signing up just to get 2-day dry and
they're not near a Costco, needless to say they're just buying those types of basic dry grocery items and
that's it.

Generally speaking, what we've seen in any given member, whatever type of member, they buy more
each year over the first few years of their membership. And then there's the age thing as well. The sweet
spot for us is still 40 to 55 year olds as they've grown economically, grown family-wise and are not on

the downside of that curve in terms of empty nesting and what have you. But I don't have any specifics
beyond that to give you.

Paul Lawrence Lejuez
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

How about club usage?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Club usage? Same thing. Again, I can tell you, I don't have anything specific, right, the last few months.
But club, other than traffic, has improved greatly from its trough 5 months ago, not back to where it was
pre-COVID. But one of the things that we see is that the typical member over the first 3 to 5 years is
growing their total purchases, which is a combination of their basket and their frequency. And clearly,
when we can convert somebody to an executive member, they are buying more and shopping more
frequently than that.

Operator

Your next question is from Oliver Chen of Cowen.

Oliver Chen
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Richard, on the e-commerce frontier, it's been really impressive what you've done. What is some of the
lower-hanging fruit that you see ahead there? And also, if you could brief us on the penetration now and
how you might see that step change and where that will head in the future.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, I mean, the main lower penetration things are, if you go back 3 or 4 years ago, I don't think we
had good e-mail addresses for much more than 1/3 of our member base and we didn't focus on that
kind of stuff. Today, we have well over 60% and growing. We now require you, when you sign up, and
more members are signing up online than in-store in general anyway, when you sign up, you sign up
with an e-mail address. So we're doing a lot more to collect and gather those e-mail addresses and then
communicating with them more often. So that's probably the single biggest low-hanging fruit.

The other thing is, is we feel that we've been able to use e-mails, if you will, not only to drive e-commerce
special promotions, but also in-store special promotions. As well, the COVID, we were pleasantly surprised
by just the sheer increase in people using same-day fresh. Anecdotally, I can't tell you how many people
have mentioned to me how they love it, and they may very well be shopping same-day fresh or same-day
whatever from their local supermarket as well. But we've got a lot of great items on there and it's hitting a
chord.

Oliver Chen
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And Richard, as we look to this holiday season, which is definitely like no other, what factors would you
prioritize as how you're planning it as best you can differently this year versus others? And is the multi-
vendor mailer in good shape? And are you going to leverage that a lot for holiday as well? I would love
thoughts around dynamics of supply chain and marketing for holiday.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, the multi-vendor mailer is back, and there may be a few items that we don't have because of certain
supply limitations. But for the most part, it's completely back after, I think, 2 or 3 of those, so 6 or 9
weeks of multi-vendor mailers, if you will, that we didn't do. I think the biggest difference is, again, for

the Christmas holidays, is getting back to basics. But you're still going to see some hot exciting items at
Costco.

The -- again, as I mentioned, even on Halloween, we still have costumes. I think we brought in something
like 80% of what we would have normally brought in, 80% or 90%, and we're actually selling them. So we
added some vendors over the last several months, given certain shortages. One of the challenges is, right
now, we've had great numbers in electronics and white goods, notwithstanding the fact that the numbers
would be better if there was greater supply. We all read about there are certain supply issues on laptops
and computers and things like that, on some of the gaming things, on some of the white goods, where
there might be downstream shortage or at least some allocation of compressors. So we're doing very well
on that. We've added some different vendors in some cases. And I think the fact that we did so well this
summer relative to what we had anticipated has given us the confidence to be still pretty aggressive going
into the fall.

Oliver Chen
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Our last question on same-day fresh and the momentum there, what are the margins like and what are
your thoughts about that margin and the take rate and also taking some of those capabilities in-house
versus using the white label?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, at this juncture, we have a very good relationship with other competitors, I'm sure, having a good
relationship also with Instacart. There's a few other smaller ones that we're using. We're not necessarily
looking to take that in-house at this juncture. But we are always looking at various third parties, and we
have good existing relationships, and we want to keep growing those as well.

Your next question is from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners.

John Edward Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Richard, so a couple of things in gross. If you -- even if you take out fresh food, right, it looks like the
other 3 were up quite a bit. Maybe dive into a little bit similarities driving those 3 big categories versus
what might be unique to each. And then how sustainable is that, right? Because this obviously is one of
the better core in cores we've seen in a while.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Sure. Well, look, first and foremost, there's -- well, I guess, 2 things. There's a little bit less promotional
activity going on. You think about TVs and electronics, those have been such a strong category, not just
for Costco but in general. The manufacturers haven't been doing as many promotional things. So -- and
the other thing is, is given just the sheer sales strength, when you're comping -- if we comped to the --
whatever it was in August 14, and I don't have it in front of me, whatever, but in some of these categories
that we talked about what was stronger, you're talking comps in the low to high 20s. When you've got
those -- that kind of sales strength, you have very -- on a much smaller scale, you have less markdowns.

So you've got a -- whatever your regular margin is on those categories, less -- a little bit less without a
little bit of an offset from end of cycle and some of those cycles are 60, 90 days, by the way, on some of
those SKUs. So that's helped you a little bit.

And then on ancillary rights, you said 75% was gas and travel. But it was gas the bulk of that? And if so,
was gas more the compare last year versus any decision you made, right, to take less margin? I imagine
it's not bad to take less margin and try to drive traffic because market is just not there, right?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

I think in terms of less margin, that's more of our DNA. When things are really good, we're going to
drive sales even further and do that. Or when things are good, we're going to -- we feel a little more
comfortable doing the $2 an hour for another month, whatever it might be. But at the end of the day,
there's probably less price competition out there today than there was a year ago, and so we're able to
maintain our fair margins.

John Edward Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

All right. And then lastly, what's the current thought process on 2 things: expanded BOPUS, which you
haven't wanted to do for cost reasons; and a third tier of membership? I don't know if it'd be a higher tier
or a middle tier but sort of segmenting that a little more.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Yes. Well, on buy online and pick up in-store, we continue to look at what others do. We continue to
scratch our head a little bit. It's not that we'll never do it but it's not on the agenda for this week. And as
it relates to an additional tier of membership, again, I don't think that's on the top of the priority plate at
this juncture, given everything else that's going on.

Your next question is from Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital.

Scott Andrew Mushkin
R5 Capital Ltd

So I guess I want to get back to Richard, to the e-commerce traffic mix and the comments that you've
made prior about really wanting to get people into the club. If the pandemic shifts that, where you're
going to see permanently traffic being an issue there, how are we supposed to -- how are we thinking
about like impulse purchases and just the Costco model once we exit the pandemic, if this kind of sticks,
with omnichannel just being a much bigger piece of the pie overall?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, first of all, keep in mind, if our online business was 5-ish percent a year ago and now it's 8-
ish percent, that's a big delta in 1 year. And it'll continue -- it will probably continue to increase as a
percentage from there. And that excludes the third-party Instacart type business, the 1-day grocery. And
so look, we've been pretty good at pivoting along the way and we recognize there's lots of attributes to
value. The first and foremost is the lowest price on the greatest quality or quantity of goods, of services
and the trust that we've endeared with our members. I think that we'll figure that out as we go along.
We're not -- we may be occasionally stubborn on something but we're not completely intransient if we
see we need to do something. We've figured out how to do things in a little different way than others, and
we'll continue to do that.

Scott Andrew Mushkin

And as far as the pickup, I know I think you were quoted in a recent article on this. I mean, how are you

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, keep in mind, when third parties do it, their cost for picking, we believe, we don't know exactly what
they are, but we believe based on our wages and benefits, is less. And they've created a model that works
with their density and everything else. They're not just buying and delivering from Costco, they're buying
and delivering to others. So there are some economics in that model that makes sense. The -- our view
also is, is there are some retailers that are doing it because they feel they have to.

One of the things the article you're talking about is the article today. The one, in my view, I think, I would
disagree in the article is that we should be concerned because our sales have started slowing, which is the
contrary. They're stronger than they've ever been in the last 3 months. So we don't have our head in the
sand on it. We look at it. We have people here that study it. And maybe we'll surprise you 1 day. But at

Your next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.

Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

I guess, just 2 related questions on real estate. So as you look at your store growth for this year, what's
the split between international and domestic? And also just given some of the challenges in brick-and-
mortar, I'm mostly just curious if you're starting to see more opportunities on the real estate front.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Yes. I mean I think our general view is, is that we still feel that we want to open -- looking at this year
and the next 5 years, open somewhere between 20 and 25 a year net new units. About half of those, a
little more than half will start by coming in the United States. And that'll trend over the 5 years to maybe
being slightly over 50-50 in the U.S. to slightly under 50-50 in the U.S. We still think we have plenty of
opportunities in the U.S.

It does take longer in certain other countries. I think we're just about ready to do a second unit in France.
We just opened our third unit in Spain after having opened our first unit in Spain, gosh, 5 years ago. We
have 1 unit in China with 2 planned for fiscal '22. We're now in fiscal '21. And so some of these countries
do take longer. But we are also putting a little bit more emphasis on that, where we've been successful
and we think we can be successful. And -- but I think again, at the 40,000-foot level, if we did 20 to 25, a
little more than half in the first couple of years is U.S. and by year 4 or 5 or 6, it'll probably be instead of
60-40 or 55-45 U.S., it'll turn to be just the opposite.

you've been there for 5 years. Like it just seems to me like there could be a lot more store expansion if
you really wanted to push it. And I guess what I'm wondering is, what keeps you from accelerating that
further?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

I think there are a couple of things. First of all, I've always said that we're a very hands-on company. And
one of the things we've learned when we've gone a little too fast, not to suggest 1 in 5 years is too fast,

it's not. But -- and I remember in Japan, we got to 10 or 12 locations and then in about 18-month period,
we opened 8 or 9 and we had a little bit of operating indigestion. As it relates to France, it took us close to
10 years to get our first open. The level of people and entities that can appeal that process and fight you
to keep you out is unbelievable. And again, in Spain, we actually have 3, fourth this year.

Generally speaking, if I look at various countries, we'd open 5 in the first 5 years, that would be relatively
fast for us. And -- but again, it gets back, I think, to getting that hands on and make sure that we feel
comfortable how the market is doing. We're probably a little slower than we could be but we feel good
about it. And it's worked for us, and we'll, I think, continue to do that.

Robert Scot Ciccarelli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

But Richard, that's on the international front. That makes sense. You've got to get comfortable with the
market and supply chain, of course. But what about just in the U.S.? Like you're obviously comfortable
with all the -- how to navigate kind of store openings and what kind of restrictions you might have. It just
seems to me like if you've got a decent amount of white space...

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Fair enough. Well, I think some of the white space gets better each year. If I look at even the Seattle
market, there was a multiyear period where we didn't open any additional units and then we opened on
the East side here, Redmond, and a couple of others. And part of it is cannibalizing nearby units. And
-- but no, we try to be relatively methodical and disciplined of kind of the returns that a new unit can
generate, net of cannibalization. And could we open 20 instead of 12 or 13 in the U.S.? Absolutely. But it's
how fast the real estate people and the regional operations people get with our CEO to go through that
process and...

Your next question is from Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

And it's getting late, so I'll be quick, but I wanted to ask you about the membership fee income up
about [ 5% ] and change, I think, this quarter, which has been pretty consistent throughout the year.
But I guess, how much of that do you think is from new members that you're picking up because of the
pandemic? Some of your competitors are seeing big increases in new members from the pandemic. It's
hard to tease that out from your numbers. I mean we compare this -- we can compare it to past MFI
numbers but it's a little lumpy because of the fee increases. So any idea of what you're picking up in terms
of new members because of the pandemic.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

We don't disclose that. It's still a smaller percentage of the total. It's not a majority of the total.

And does it surprise you that those membership numbers aren't accelerating more as you might see from
some of your competitors?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Our view, when we've looked at some of our competitors' numbers, is partly because they have a much
lower number of members per location than we do. And we -- that's our view. But the fact is, is when we
look at how penetrated we are in so many of our markets, I mean, we are, even in California, where we
have 120, 130 units, I forgot how many units we have there, I believe we're north of 60% -- slightly north
of 60% member household market share. In states like Oregon and Washington, we're well in excess of
that. So I think that's part of the issue in our view. We've got a lot of people already.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Right. Yes. Yes, it makes sense. All right. If I could ask 1 follow-up on gas gallons sold, you said you're at
10% today. That's not 10% for the quarter, down 10%, that is, I believe, right? That's sort of a point in
time. Did you mention how your gas gallons sold were for the -- as we go through the whole quarter?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

We did not. That's a more recent number in the last month, let's say. I mentioned that it may have been
even in the end of Q3, which ended like May 10 or May whatever, around then, where we're like a minus
50%. But my guess is, is we're somewhere in the low to mid-teens for the last month.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

For the last quarter or for the last month?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

The last month in low teens.

Michael Allen Baker
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. And so the total quarter is somewhere in between those 2 numbers, presumably?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Yes. Yes.

Your next question is from Peter Benedict of Baird.

Peter Sloan Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Richard, just a question on how the product shortage issues that you guys have seen around COVID might
be influencing your view on where you might go next in terms of vertical sourcing. I mean, I don't assume
there's anything electronics or white goods, but has the experience in the last 4 or 5 months maybe bent
the curve in terms of when certain initiatives might be pulled forward?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

21

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

Well, in terms of vertical initiatives, we've got -- the last 2 or 3 years have been quite a bit, not only a
bakery commissary that serves U.S. and Canada, just across the Canadian border, not only a second
meat plant in Illinois versus the one we've had for many years in California, not only the poultry complex
and not only a couple of smaller produce initiatives we've got going on right now. And last, but not even
expected, but the acquisition of Innovel or what we now call Costco Logistics. So we got our hands full
with a lot of things right now.

I don't necessarily see -- I think one of the things that we've learned from COVID, we have great
relationships with large companies, both consumer product name companies and private label name
companies doing literally multi-hundreds of millions of dollars of 1 item. When there has been some
shortage of supply, we've had to expand that vendor network a little bit. There are some instances, where
given our sheer volume in Asia now, can we find a comparable manufacturer or an existing supplier that
wants to do something over there. So I think there's some -- there'll be some ways to continue to reduce
costs on key items. But in terms of what's the next big vertical, I don't know if we know at this point.

Peter Sloan Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. No, that's fair. And then just last on the travel bookings, you had mentioned that you're starting to
see a pickup there but it's further out than normal. Can you -- can you frame maybe what's normal and
what you're kind of seeing right now? I thought that was interesting.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

This is my definition of what I've understood previously at normal is if you go back pre-COVID, the
majority of your bookings each day related to stuff in the next few months, maybe a little further out for 5
months before Christmas or 5 months before the beginning of summer. Today, you've got people booking
things out 5 and 9 months in some cases.

Now there's 2 reasons: one, there's some great deals out there; and two, in many instances, there's
no cancellation charges. And so we'll have to wait and see. And part of that will be dictated by -- we've
actually sold and had some members go on some cruises of late, still a very small number. The car rental
business has picked up a little bit better than the other but still down relative to what it had been pre-
COVID.

Overall -- yes. Overall, and mind you, if we book something out 9 months, we don't take it into revenue
until it's -- the trip is taken. So even though business has improved in terms of what we show in our
numbers, there's very little -- it's just starting to -- it's not -- first of all, it's not negative right now. There
are a few months there in April, May, June -- or April, May, certainly, where cancellation costs were greater
than trips being taken.

Your next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital.

Kelly Ann Bania
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just wanted to ask maybe a 2-part question here. More and more, retailers are talking a little bit about
advertising maybe as a way to offset their lower margin e-commerce business. And so I was curious,
one, if you could talk about where are e-com margins, just with all the acceleration. And maybe just also
remind us what bucket that is in your table. But then also just philosophically, how do you think about
that? Maybe any -- taking on any more ad revenue to your dotcom business.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, we're taking on more ad revenue and we keep learning more about that as well as we drive that
business. And -- but overall, the margins, it's lower gross margins. Part of that is category specific.

22

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  SEP 24, 2020

Electronics, which is by far the largest single component of e-commerce, is a high single-digit margin. If
you think about it, in the Costco warehouse, you've got fresh that's in the low double digits, sometimes, a
preteen or early teen. And you've got, again, conversely electronics, which is mid to high.

You also, as we try to drive the business in certain new categories like apparel, where you buy 2 items
and get $5 off or whatever they're marketing or promotional item is, there's a lower realized margin on a
given category in some of those categories versus in store. So overall, you also have less SG&A. And I get
back to what Costco has always been a top line company. We're looking to grow at top line. Certainly, the
profitability of e-commerce has improved dramatically in the last year with these strong sales but it's part
of the ecosystem.

Robert E. Nelson
Senior Vice President of Financial Planning & Investor Relations

And it's in ancillary with -- [ where it is ].

Your next question is from Laura Champine of Loop Capital.

Laura Allyson Champine
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Just a quick one, Richard. You've managed to improve inventory turns or grow inventories slower than
sales since the onset of COVID. I know that some of this has been supply chain issues or issues with
certain SKU sourcing, but that seems to be clearing up. How long can you keep improving inventory turns
at this pace?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, if we keep doing 14% sales for a while, but I say that tongue-in-cheek because we -- if you go back
to April and May, the inventory turn had come down, one of the reasons we were planning for additional
capital -- working capital needs. I -- yes. Look, I think we've gotten to a point when we've enjoyed a turn
based on how you calculate it in the 12% to 13% range, when you get up to that range, it's difficult to
some extent as well. Gas helps it because we turn gas every day. Fresh foods helps it because we turn
fresh foods every week or less, I think about every week, maybe a little better than that. And the fact that
we didn't have a big denigration on nonfood items, which we had thought would be an offset to that. So
it's helped a little bit right now. But if you ask me if I could just keep where we are right now, I'd say sure.

Blake Anderson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just lastly, can you talk about renewal rates and your expectations on those? Should we
expect them to maybe creep higher, given all the comp strength you're seeing now?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Yes. Sorry, you're 0 for 2. We don't guide. No, we don't guide. There are things that help the comp -- that
help the renewal rate, getting people to executive, getting people to do our credit card. Some of the things
we do now when you sign up online...

Robert E. Nelson

Autobill.

Richard A. Galanti

Autobill. And so those are things that help push it upward a little bit or...

Robert E. Nelson
Senior Vice President of Financial Planning & Investor Relations

Delivering [and issuing, too].

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Yes. The fact -- to the extent -- but conversely, if we ramped up internationally, and not that we are going
to do that overnight, but if we ramped up internationally, you start -- in any new market or new -- the first
few warehouses in a new country, you work on a much lower renewal rate to start with, but a much higher
number of initial sign-ups because there's a lot looking at those. And so all those things weigh in. We feel,
so far that -- I know as soon as we show a minus 0.1% in the quarter, which, knock on wood, we haven't
of late, people will worry what's going on. But our view is, is that we're hanging on to our members. We're
getting them to -- we're -- in most countries, even in new countries, we've seen the trend to more often
improve than not. And so I think we feel pretty good about that. Why don't we take 2 more questions?

Richard A. Galanti

Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

-Ish, all right. So on traffic, I guess that was my follow-up. You talked a lot about, and it's nice to see the
U.S. traffic come back through the quarter. Could you help us understand why international traffic remains
negative and if there's any outlier countries driving that? Or is really the U.S. the outlier with traffic would
come back? And if you're concerned that, that could influence the renewal rates in those international
markets?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, no, Canada is the outlier internationally. Mind you, U.S. is a little over 70% of our company's sales.
Canada is around 10%, maybe...

Robert E. Nelson

15%.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

15%? I'm sorry, 15%. And so you've got other international being less than...

Robert E. Nelson

It is going to drive it, but a lot more restriction code here so...

Richard A. Galanti

There have been more restrictions in Canada. Australia also, there have been more lockdowns of late. But
Canada, and we have no direct warehouse competition in Canada. We've seen their traffic...

Robert E. Nelson

More negative in the basket, even bigger.

Richard A. Galanti

Yes, more negative with a basket even bigger than the U.S. So we still got them buying and we've seen
that improve also. It's -- and that negative has been reduced. So hopefully, that will continue as well.

Richard A. Galanti

It went further down, to start with, too. I mean, I think even -- I'm shooting from the hip here, but even

And we have Robert Moskow of Crédit Suisse.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I wanted to know if you're noticing any regional differences in terms of how consumers are behaving
during the pandemic. Infection rates are rising in certain states. There's threat of more, I don't know if
it'll fully go to lockdowns or not. But do you see any differences in terms of how they're getting ready for
Halloween or worried about trick-or-treating or anything like that? And how are you responding to that?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

I can't be specific -- tell you specifically about Halloween. The only -- if I look back over the last several
months, the only thing that we saw was, is when certain states unlocked more quickly, we saw a little
pickup there faster earlier because people were getting out faster, some of those states that did that.
Other than that, we haven't seen anything dramatic.

Robert E. Nelson
Senior Vice President of Financial Planning & Investor Relations

I would say, honestly, too, pandemic has progressed, people were comfortable. They're still going out
more.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Right. Yes. Bob makes a good point here. I think -- and we're all a little guilty of it is as the pandemic has
progressed, we're all hopefully...

Hello? God dammit. Hello?

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. We hear you.

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Oh, you hear me now. I thought I hang up on you. Sorry. I think as the pandemic has continued, people
have gotten a little more comfortable, hopefully still maintaining the safety protocols but going out more
often, and that's helped us. The numbers picked up a little bit as well. And overall, again, anecdotally, we
feel that people feel more comfortable coming into a place where masks are required, where the places
-- the physical spaces are larger with more cubic feet of open air, if you will. So I think those things have
probably helped us. But the only real difference we saw was during those couple of months where some
states opened up a little faster than others.

business in 2021?

Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

Well, that's -- it's a net positive but we don't know. Does that also mean as people eat out more
frequently, they're going to buy less food, fresh food or food items at supermarkets and Costcos? There's
probably some different offsets there. Again, we believe that some of the things that we've picked up
through this pandemic, in part because a lot of these nonfood discretionary categories and big-ticket
categories, some of that's going to be sticky. And once they've shopped and had a good experience at
Costco at a great value, they'll hopefully continue that.
