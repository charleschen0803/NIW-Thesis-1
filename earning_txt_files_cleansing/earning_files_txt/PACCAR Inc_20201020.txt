Operator

Good morning, and welcome to PACCAR's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings,
please go ahead.

Ken Hastings
Senior Director of Investor Relations

Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name
is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Preston Feight,
Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley,
Senior Vice President and Controller.

As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-
only mode.

Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including
general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. For additional information,
please see our SEC filings and the Investor Relations page of paccar.com.

I would now like to introduce Preston Feight.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Good morning. Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on our excellent third quarter
results and business highlights.

First and foremost, I appreciate our outstanding PACCAR employees. They have continued to focus
on staying safe and healthy while delivering the highest quality trucks, advanced powertrains and
transportation solutions to our customers. PACCAR achieved strong revenues and net income in the third
quarter. PACCAR's quarterly truck deliveries doubled to 36,000 vehicles compared to the second quarter of
this year.

PACCAR's quarterly sales and financial services revenues were $4.9 billion and third quarter net income
was $386 million. PACCAR Parts achieved quarterly revenues of over $1 billion and pretax profits of $210
million, exceeding the strong third quarter of last year. Truck, Parts and Other gross margins increased to
12.8%.

PACCAR Financial achieved robust new financing business and pretax income of $56 million. U.S. and
Canada Class 8 truck industry orders through September were 18% higher than the same period last year.
PACCAR expects fourth quarter deliveries to be 10% higher than the third quarter as build rates increase
in all markets.

The fourth quarter will have fewer build days in North America and more build days in Europe. Fourth
quarter Truck, Parts and Other gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 12% to 13%.

We have raised our 2020 market size estimates in North America, Europe and South America. We estimate
Class 8 industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada to be in a range of 190,000 to 210,000 trucks this
year. Peterbilt and Kenworth have achieved 29.7% market share through September compared to 29.2%
for the same period last year.

For 2021, U.S. economy is expected to grow about 4%, and we estimate the U.S. and Canadian Class 8
truck market to be in the range of 210,000 to 250,000 vehicles. In Europe, truck industry registrations

in the above 16-tonne market are estimated to be in a range of 210,000 to 230,000 vehicles this year.
DAF has achieved market share of 16.1% through September this year and European economies are
projected to grow about 5% next year and we expect truck registrations to increase to a range of 230,000
to 270,000 units.

The South American above 16-tonne market is projected to be in a range of 95,000 to 105,000 units
next year. DAF Brazil introduced a new XF truck in the third quarter, which has been well received by our
customers. In the Brazilian above 40-tonne segment where DAF competes, DAF market share through
September increased to a record 9.3%.

PACCAR's zero emissions vehicle programs continue to move forward. We have begun accepting orders
for our industry-leading battery-electric trucks that will serve the medium duty, regional haul and refuse
markets in Europe and North America. Production of these trucks will begin next year. Vehicle charging
stations will be available through PACCAR Parts.

We're pleased to share that PACCAR, Kenworth, Peterbilt, PACCAR Parts and Dynacraft were each
recognized as a top company for women to work for in transportation by the Women in Trucking
Association. We were honored for excellent working environment and company culture that supports
gender diversity. PACCAR is committed to hiring and promoting the most talented people in the world and
we know that the best people represent the diversity present in the global community.

Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other
business highlights. Thank you. Harrie?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

Thanks, Preston. PACCAR continues to provide excellent operating cash flow for reinvestment in future
growth and distributions to stockholders. Last month, the PACCAR Board of Directors announced a regular
quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. PACCAR Parts achieved quarterly revenues of $1.020 billion and
pretax profits of $210 million. PACCAR Parts benefited from the economic recovery, high truck utilization,
a growing global distribution network and investments in our state of the art e-commerce platform. E-
commerce is PACCAR Part's fastest growing business.

PACCAR Financial Services third quarter revenues were $398 million and pretax income was $56 million.
These results reflect strong portfolio performance, low past dues and record used truck sales. Robust used
truck sales led to a reduction in used truck inventory. PACCAR financial is increasing its used truck center
capacity worldwide, which enhances margins. PACCAR Financial recently opened used truck centers in
Lyon, France; Denton, Texas; and in Prague, Czech Republic and plans to open another facility in Madrid,
Spain next year.

PACCAR's truck resale values come on a premium over the competition.

Research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $270 million to $280 million this
year. And capital investments are projected to be in the range of $570 million to $600 million. In 2021,
we're planning for R&D expenses of $330 million to $360 million and capital investments of $575 million to
$625 million. PACCAR is investing for long-term growth in new truck models, low-emission diesel and zero
emissions powertrain technologies, advanced driver assistance systems and connected services.

And finally, our independent Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers continue to provide outstanding support
to our customers. Our dealers are well capitalized and have invested $2.6 billion in their businesses in the
last 10 years, making a significant contribution to PACCAR's success.
Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.

PACCAR INC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.

Nicole Sheree DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I guess, maybe starting with the outlook for 4Q. I know you guys said that you expect build rates to
increase across all markets. Is there any way that you could kind of characterize the level of growth that
you're seeing in North America versus Europe, given the element of build days?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes, great comments, Nicole. You already captured part of the answer in talking about build days, but we
have seen increases in build rates throughout the third quarter and more than doubling from the second
quarter. The fourth quarter will also see increases in build rates, daily build rates in all markets. And then
from a total delivery standpoint, we'd expect to see a higher number of deliveries in Europe because of the
build mix there, where we have more build days in Europe compared to the third quarter where there's the
holiday shutdown.

But all markets are seeing increases in build rates as the -- with the strong order intake we've been
seeing.

Nicole Sheree DeBlase
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then just one more on Europe. I mean, obviously, we're all seeing the
headlines with respect to COVID cases ramping up. Just curious what you guys have seen most recently
with respect to order activity from customers, whether that's been impacted by COVID.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure. Well, obviously, we had the same news you do, and we watch the increases in COVID cases, but our
customers have really been providing strong order intake for the excellent DAF trucks that we make. We
haven't seen any hesitation in orders in recent times has come up. And our factories are doing a great job
of making sure that health and safety is the most important thing that we focus on each and every day. So
we're able to build trucks in the environment, in a safe and effective way and order intake remains strong.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.

Andrew Millard Casey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

A question on the battery-electric trucks you're introducing next year. I'm wondering if you're accepting
orders for those already. The reason I'm asking is the narrative on those type of trucks is that they
probably are going to have lower future part sales opportunity than clean diesel equipped trucks. First,
is that -- does that jive with your expectations? And then second, can you help us understand how you
would approach pricing, given that potential lower future parts revenue stream should you expect to
capture kind of a higher-margin upfront? Or anything you could do to help us would be appreciated.

PACCAR INC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

Sure thing. Well, your first comment about whether we're accepting orders, we are accepting orders, both
Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF are taking orders for the trucks. We expect to begin production next year of
the trucks. We are actually providing them to customers already and doing test work with our customers.
We're working on battery technology as well as hydrogen fuel cell technology. And in fact, just from a
fun thing to share last week, Kenworth and Peterbilt took a hydrogen fuel cell truck and a battery-electric
truck. Kenworth was the hydrogen fuel cell, Peterbilt was the battery-electric and they drove them up
Pikes Peak all the way to the summit.

So the programs are progressing along nicely. The team is having a lot of fun developing excellent
products and we're looking forward to that market developing. It is early days. And so from a standpoint
of how many orders, it could be in the hundreds. When we look at your question of parts sales and what
we think looking forward, I think there's going to be plenty of parts that go along with electric vehicles for
a while. And one way to think about it is the cost of a battery pack is pretty significant, it's a contributing
factor to a cost of an electric vehicle. And somewhere in a lifetime, a battery pack could be replaced. They
also have the same suspension components, the same steering components, and they will have wear
items, just like every other truck does.

So I think that the pricing of how we'll do that will be based on cost and good margins. And Harrie?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

Well, in addition to the trucks, that we will also be selling chargers and also the chargers will need
replacement parts.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

So the total of all of that, I think, is that I don't think it's going to be disruptive to our model. I think it
could even be helpful to our model for the coming period of time.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.

Stephen Edward Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe just sort of sticking with that, but broadening it out a little bit. Sometimes I get questions around
just how do you view kind of R&D spending for the next few years? And some people seem to think maybe
others are spending more. I know your business model is a little bit more outsourced, a little bit more
partner-driven. But maybe you can just talk about how we should view your level of R&D spending over
the next few years as we kind of make this transition.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, we always make sure that we invest appropriately for the opportunities that we have. And I think
our history has demonstrated a great set of investments that have been good for our customers and we
always think about it from a customer standpoint. And I can tell you what, I've never been more excited
than I am right now about the kind of products we're bringing out over the coming year or 2. And going
forward, for the next 5-year strategy we've laid out, we have a great set of products coming out. So the
spending may increase a little bit, as Harrie showed or commented on, we could see $330 million to $360
million in R&D spending next year. But a real focus on making sure that our customers get the very best
trucks, transportation solutions and parts and it's never been better than right now.

PACCAR INC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

Okay. All right. And then just a quick follow-up. I appreciate your initial views on '21. I'm just curious
relative to kind of inventories, I know you guys aren't big on inventories, but would you expect to produce
more next year than whatever the retail sales turns out to be? Or would you sort of produce in line with
that, do you think?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

If you start with where we're at now, there's 2.5 months of industry inventory out there and PACCAR, can
repeat, will have about 2.2 months. And so when I look at that and I think about what the order intake
looks like, build rates intake, I think it will be roughly in line, could be a little bit more production, but not
too much.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America.

Ross Paul Gilardi
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Maybe we'll stay on the EV topic. If you look out 5 years, do you have an expectation that you can share
of EVs as a percentage of either Class 8 or Class 6, 7 production?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure. We think is the way this market is going to develop, Ross, is it's going to be hundreds kind of
next year. And then we'll get to a point in 2024 and 2025, where there's some regulatory requirements
for production. And by that time, we should see ourselves in the thousands, low thousands. And it will
obviously depend on what kind of regulatory environment develops throughout Europe or California.

And what we want to make sure we have is the products that are ready to go and the most reliable and
capable products. And so that's the path we're on. So we'll be ready if there's -- ready for thousands or
stays at hundreds. And if it wants to go to tens of thousands, we'll be prepared for that.

Ross Paul Gilardi
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So low thousands by 2024, '25 on a 250,000 replacement market, you're talking like 1% of the market by
then?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes, that's it. Yes.

Ross Paul Gilardi
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And how about Class 8 versus 6, 7 because certainly in a battery up until now has been a bigger
technical challenge? But of course, you're working on hydrogen fuel cell as well. So what are your
thoughts there?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

So thinking is there, as you mentioned well, Ross, it will be medium-duty and urban environments where
trucks return back to a fixed location, fixed operation is an easy place for adoption to begin. But if there
are places like in Europe where cities might not allow a diesel truck in, then that will mean regional
haul trucks could end up being battery-electric. And then as fuel cells become viable and commercially
relevant, then they could play a role also. So I think right now, what we're doing is making sure that we

PACCAR INC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

look at a range of full capabilities and technology choices out there and integrating them in an effective
way for our customers.

Ross Paul Gilardi
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. And then can you talk a little bit about just how you see the shape of the cycle evolving next couple
of years with the explosion of e-commerce? Not that e-commerce is a new thing, but clearly, we're all
seeing the numbers for e-commerce. And kind of the way I'm thinking of it, if North America Class 8
replacement is normally 225,000 to 250,000, are we at a higher number now because of the environment
we're in? And then also on top of that, is there any motivation for the company to move down market into
the light-duty space to capitalize on more of the growth in things like delivery vans and last mile?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, I think that as e-commerce comes along, it's not going to affect the fact that people consume on an
individual basis, the same amount of goods. It's maybe it's how those goods are delivered, but there'll
still be manufacturing and distribution. And I don't think that will fundamentally or structurally change
any way from a Class 6 through 8 market. I would share that we have some amazing products in that
Class 6 market space right now with our cabover products here in North America. It's also the market
leader in the U.K. for that cabover LF. And we have some early need products we're developing to fill in
and continue to develop the medium-duty space for ourselves in the coming years.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.

Jamie Lyn Cook
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I guess, 2 questions. My first question, as we think about 2021, can you talk about your confidence level
in terms of market outgrowth, whether it be on the parts side, market share on truck or the 11- and 13-
liter engine? Just how we should think about that as markets recover? And then my second question, can
you comment, was there any sort of mix or pricing dynamics in the third quarter? What you saw on that
front?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

So just to start with, if you think about share, we've got 29.7% of the market share in the U.S. and
Canada right now year-to-date compared to 29.2%. So we're seeing good share growth for ourselves. Our
MX engines are doing a great job out there with the 11-liter and the 13-liter. Of course, it's 100% of our
engine volume in Europe and is 41% in North America. So that's working really well for us in addition. And
then from a...

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

From a pricing point of view, the pricing in the third quarter was more or less slightly down like 0.5% or
so, but pretty good performance in terms of pricing, given the current market dynamics.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

And that's compared to a very strong 2019.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

Absolutely. Absolutely.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.

Ann P. Duignan
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just a few follow-up questions. In Financial Services, on the interest expense line, that was higher than we
had expected. Can you just talk about that line item and what was in there? Were there any anomalies? Or
is that kind of the runway rate that we should look at going forward?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

In the third quarter, Jamie, we sold a record number of used trucks and the cost of those used trucks
appear in that line item. And used truck results were unfavorable compared to last year, but they were
very similar to the second quarter. Overall, the finance company is doing really well. You saw low credit
losses. We have low past dues of only 0.6% at the end of the third quarter. Good portfolio, A and B
credits, customers continue to pay their bills, finance company is doing really well.

Ann P. Duignan
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

But are you saying that if that was a higher expense than the last couple of quarters that you're recording
a loss on each sale of a used truck? And so more used truck sales means a higher loss? Or a higher
expense?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

Yes, Ann. Like in the second quarter, results on used trucks were unfavorable. It was nice to see that the
used truck inventory came down during the third quarter. So that's going to be good going forward.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

And we're starting to see that in some of these trucks areas where people are looking for great products,
they're starting to see pricing increases. And Peterbilt, Kenworth, DAF, they continue to provide a premium
resell value in our used truck business compared to the competition.

Ann P. Duignan
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. But if everybody's used prices are down, it's kind of relative to [indiscernible].

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

Yes, we get a premium on the used trucks, but yes, we're not the only one in the used truck market.

Ann P. Duignan
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Exactly. And then can you just explain a little bit more or talk a little bit more about the e-commerce
business in parts? Give us a little bit more color on what's going on there. You highlighted it in your
opening comments. I'd like to hear it more.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure thing, Ann. I mean, we've had e-commerce for a long time, but our PACCAR Parts team did a
fantastic job of creating a real user-friendly, easy to use for customers and dealers e-commerce system

PACCAR INC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

that just makes ordering easier, but it also makes related parts easier so that it's quite simple to go in and
find if you buy a filter for something, it might also point you towards another component. So the team has
done a great job of making a very easy user interface. And we've seen significant growth in the amount
of e-commerce we're doing. It's one of the fast -- it is the fastest-growing part of our Parts business as
people transition there. So that's really nice.

I'd also just give a shout out to the Parts team for the way they're engaging with the dealers on auto
except for dealer inventory stocking. So they're doing a fantastic job on that front, too. And I think both
those things, plus the support of how the team is supporting our customers is leading to their growth.

Ann P. Duignan
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And so the way for us to think about that business going forward is there's opportunity for a -- more
customers to use e-commerce and then be a higher spend per customer? Is it -- are there 2 opportunities
there? Is that the right way for us to think about it? And then I'll give it back.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Great wording, Ann. I agree with you, yes.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

What really jumped out this quarter was your SG&A performance, like you mentioned, production nearly
doubled, your SG&A was up just 7% sequentially. How should we think about the SG&A run rate from
here? Any cost that we should think about as coming back in better times? Or is this a situation where
we're actually going to be able to run rate this level of SG&A going forward?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, I think the team has done a fantastic job of cost control, as always, right? We look at everything
we do and spend where it's necessary. So I think there will be some modest increases as we get into the
fourth quarter. Just a for example, if you think about travel, right, getting anywhere internationally has
been relatively limited. So when that opens up or as travel reopens, that will become a possibility for
SG&A increases.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then in terms of your electric vehicle lineup, really impressive range of products that you folks
have available for order. You're obviously, skewing on the local range. One of your new competitors is
laying out a 500-mile product at 180,000. Can you just talk about your decision not to lay out a product
within that mileage range and how feasible do you think that cost point is if we're talking about 5 years
out for the industry as a whole? Can you weigh in?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure, happily. I do think, as I said earlier, that the urban areas will be the easiest places to make a
cost-effective decision around battery-electric vehicles. And I think in the battery-electric space, for the
regional home markets and the refuse market, that's also an opportunity, again, where you're coming
back to a charging station.

PACCAR INC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

When you get into the longer lengths of haul, especially a number like 500 miles, you're talking about
needing a significant charging infrastructure. And you also have to realize that the weight of the batteries
become significant to the total operating efficiency of the haul. So we think that it will evolve in a rational
manner and we'll participate in that. And that's why we look at both the battery electric and the hydrogen
fuel cells because battery-electric will be rational for some of the routes we just described. And potentially,
fuel cell will take off on some of the longer haul, but it also needs an infrastructure.

So we just want to make sure that we're there with the right products for our customers. And as they
want them, we'll have them.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And lastly, the CARB regulations for 2024 look for pretty meaningful increases in warranties and
big reductions in NOx. Can you talk about your plan for those standards? And how much does the cost
structure have to move higher? Some industry participants are talking about the warranty cost being over
$10,000 essentially adding to the cost of a truck. Can you just talk about how you see it playing out and
your plans for the standards?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, we've been through a lot of emission cycles as we've gone through the decades now. And as an
industry and certainly as PACCAR, we're always able to meet them. We intend to be able to meet them
as well. We do expect that the warranty requirements change, and that just does -- that's an accrual
rate. So we'll make the right accrual rates for that. But we believe in our technical capabilities for both
us and our partners in Cummins to develop great engines and powertrains that will meet the diesel
emissions requirements for the coming decade. And as we've talked a lot about already today, we'll have a
complementary set of products in the electric vehicle space and hybrid space.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And is that $10,000-plus number increase in the cost of a vehicle, is that reasonable? Can you just weigh
in on that aspect? How material is the cost increase to that customer?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

And Jerry, I don't think that it would be appropriate at this point. It's pretty early days, and we have a lot
of great people working on those things, and we'll figure out ways to manage that cost to the lowest level
possible.

Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So my question relates to just trying to think through the gross margin profile for 2021. In the third
quarter and first quarter this year, you delivered 36,000 and 38,000 trucks, respectively. And you're
anticipating 39,000 to 40,000 deliveries next quarter, the fourth quarter. And during the middle of last
decade, when you were delivering similar volumes each quarter, gross margins were pretty comfortably
between 14% and 15%. And this year, in those quarters, including what you're forecasting for the fourth
quarter, they're only between 12% and 13%. I would assume addressing cost and manufacturing volatility
due to the pandemic could account for maybe all that 200 basis points for lower gross margins, even
though Parts is a bigger piece of the revenue today than 5 years ago?

PACCAR INC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 20, 2020

So that all said, I'm just trying to think about for 2021, just trying to think through likely quarterly
delivery volumes. Should we expect a return to the relationship of usual where volumes are and gross
margins? Or is there something about incremental cost or sales mix for '21 that we really should consider
moving off that traditional relationship of volume and gross margin?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, two-part answer to your question, David, thanks for the question, good discussion, is when you think
about our market sizes right now that we're talking about, we're coming off of the second quarter, as you
know well, was pretty quiet. We're returning to some more increased rates. So if this year is 190 to 210,
we think next year in the U.S., Canada could be in that 210 to 250 range. It's still below replacement
value. So it's still not a giant market, it's a healthy market.

And I think there's a lot of uncertainty around what next year will bring in terms of the general economy
and COVID and protocols we have in place from a labor control standpoint and making sure our employees
are safe and cared for. So I think it's a little bit early to be kind of weighing in on what next year's full
margins might likely be.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Should I take that, though, because if volumes are similar to a prior period, I mean, the volumes are
the same. Is it a function of it's simply about price cost? And obviously, the more robust the market is,
the better you can do on price. And it was also efficient for any mix. I'm just trying to understand, 200
basis points this year was not a normal year. So I'm not saying the margin should be as high as 5 years
ago with these volumes. I'm just trying to think if we can move through this, just kind of framework
something to think about for '21. And it sounds like you're saying all volumes aren't created equal. And it's
not necessarily due to mix, but it's more the robustness of the market where maybe you can get a little
better price or not. Is that a fair generalization?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I think that's a fair generalization. And I think the other way to think of it is, as we look historically
and even right now, PACCAR always delivers the best industry's highest operating margins, and we'll
continue to focus on delivering that.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I appreciate it. One last quick question. Delivery lead times. Obviously, orders are ramping up a bit. But
can you give us a sense of where delivery lead times today, say, particularly at a Denton and Chillicothe
versus this time last year? Just a rough idea in, say, a number of weeks?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure. Happy to do that. We're looking at -- on filling in just the final slots in the fourth quarter. We're
substantially full in both the U.S. and Europe. There are a few slots in that late November-December time
frame. They're moving quickly, and we're really kind of getting our attention focused into the first part of
next year.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And how would you compare that versus this time last year?

Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO.

Joel Gifford Tiss
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Most of them have been answered. I wondered if you think you're going to be, just in your model and the
way things are sort of laid out, you think you're going to be close to breakeven by that 2025 in electric? Or
you think it's going to take a little longer than that?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

We like to make money in everything we do, Joel. And so I think that our angle is to do that. It's early
days, but our focus is always to build great products, provide great services to our customers and make
money doing it. And that's our model for EV just as well as it is for anything else we do.

Joel Gifford Tiss
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And are you seeing any sort of outsized market share opportunities with one of your bigger competitors
being a little distracted? Or it's just sort of business as usual?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

We think that we can just share with the customers how great our trucks are and especially things we're
developing that are coming out in the coming years that, that will take care of market share for us. We
just want to make sure we get them to understand how fantastic the performance is of these products
we're creating.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.

Steven Fisher
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just to -- just want to follow-up on David Raso's question, but more in the near-term rather than 2021,
the margins in Q4, it sounds like on the 10% increase in deliveries, but the flat margin. Can you just talk
about what some of the puts and takes in the near-term are within that, keeping the margin flat on higher
volume?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes, we think that, that 12% to 13% is good margin performance for where we're sitting in the market
sizes that we're dealing with, but just a couple of the puts and takes as in the fourth quarter, there are
more build days in Europe compared to North America. And there's a mix shift in -- as trucks increase
compared to parts. And so those are 2 factors that weigh into that fourth quarter margin. But we still
believe that our focus is on providing the industry's best operating margins, and we expect to do so.

Steven Fisher
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just curious how much is timing within the order book shifting around right
now and in what direction? I'm wondering to what extent you're seeing orders either getting accelerated

or getting pushed out. I imagine there might be some different dynamics within some of the different end
markets that you're serving, be it on-highway or vocational construction, et cetera. I'm curious where it all
nets out if you're seeing people actually wanting trucks earlier or if you're trying to push them out a little
-- people are pushing them out a little further?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

What we see is nothing really related to push-outs right now. And what we see is that the trucking
economy is doing pretty well in most of its sectors. So the refrigerated carriers are doing well, the housing
people in support of vocational markets are doing well. The consumer goods markets are doing well, and
this is true for both Europe and North America. And people have been running their trucks at a below
replacement value or replacement market size for a year. And so the opportunities that -- they're ready for
the excellent performing high fuel efficiency, high reliability trucks that we're building now. And so there's
no real push-outs happening, it's people that are ordering to support their businesses, which are doing
really well.

Steven Fisher
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And any accelerations?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. There's been growth in orders as obvious over the last quarter or so, and it continues to be
appropriate to the market sizes that we're sitting in.

Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein.

Charles Albert Edward Dillard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So can you talk a little bit more about your strategy of providing charging infrastructure for the battery
electric vehicles? If you could touch on the scope, just how big of an investment do you need to get
to that, I guess, at that low thousands that you're talking about in 2024? And I know that PACCAR is
providing, but is the cost included in the actual price to the consumer? Or is this more of an investment at
PACCAR in what still needs to be made to get that market to scale?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

I think the way to think about charging is that you need a charger for your vehicle or for every 2 vehicles,
depending on how you operate. And so that's something that we'll develop as the vehicle park increases.
It will probably be through our dealerships who are doing a great job of kind of preparing themselves for
the industry. But it will also be through our customers who are operating, as I said, in locally domiciled
routes. And then I think there will be a more general development of the charging infrastructure that goes
along.

And again, one way to think about charging stations is they're kind of going to be $150,000 or a couple
of hundred thousand dollars to put in a charging infrastructure station for yourself. So that is going to
be something where people are having to spend money on. And PACCAR Parts is selling them now, and
our financial companies are offering support of that. So kind of have created an entire model for the
customers as we move into that new opportunity.

Got it. That's helpful. And then can you just provide color on the engine parts mix versus other parts of
the business in the quarter? And how close are we to seeing that inflection point where your engines sold
several years ago actually could start consuming more parts? And how do you think about that from like a
gross margin mix perspective as we look towards the next year?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

I think there continues to be -- we started the engine in the North American market in 2010. So people
have gone through, obviously, a build cycle of it. We've got repeat customers that are seeing over that
span growth in the engine business, and it provides great parts return.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

And it's fair to say that the engine parts business has grown faster than our average parts business. So we
do get benefits from that going forward, too.

Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Nice to see the Parts revenue turn positive here in the quarter. I was wondering if you could just give any
color on the cadence there. I think you had previously said June was running, I think, down mid-single
digits. Should we -- is the right way to think about it that September was up kind of mid- to high singles?
Is that a fair way to think about the ramp?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

Yes, that's correct. September was, on a per day basis, was up 4% compared to last year. So we've seen
continued positive momentum through the quarter.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then just going back to the Financial -- FinCo business. It sounds like you kind of cleared
the decks here a little bit with some inventory. So should we start to -- should we expect to start to
see margin be up going forward? And do you think that, that can get back into that sort of 20% margin
business next year?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

It was really good to see the used truck inventory come down and selling a lot of used trucks. A lot of
the used truck performance will depend on what the used truck market does in general. And in fact, our
trucks get a nice premium, but we're also dependent on what our competitors are doing in that same
marketplace.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. If I could maybe just tuck in one last one. On the higher CapEx going forward, does any of that to
include investments in your -- any of your suppliers? Or can you just talk about the health of the supply

managed through the last couple of quarters, very dynamic. They've done a good job of pulling, as we're
watching the build rates go up, across the world. They're supporting that very well. They're focused on
health and safety for their employees, too. And the supply base is in good shape. And so that continues to
be one of our great partnerships, is working with them and making sure they're ready as we go.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Elkott with Cowen.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

If I may ask a question on the -- go back to that Class 8 build cycle, I think after the initial COVID
shutdowns, we saw a number of dynamics emerge, lower fuel prices, lower interest rates and maybe truck
insurance premiums, not as bad as they had been feared given the lower claims for insurance companies.
Are we effectively basically pulling forward the cyclical expansion in Class 8 orders in North America and
we could see somewhat of a moderation once we regain some sort of a post-COVID normalcy?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

I think we just came off of the third quarter, which was a good quarter, but we think that there's a lot of
room for the markets to continue to just gradually strengthen, depending on what happens in the general
economy.

Related to insurance and stuff, what I would share from our standpoint and play in that is we make sure
that our trucks are able to be equipped with the latest in safety technologies to support low rates to make
sure that our customers have vision systems and lane departure and those kinds of features that help our
customers keep their drivers in the general public safe. That's where our focus is there. But I think it's a
little early after just a month or 2 of goodness to start thinking about it being towards the top.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

No, that's a fair point. And just one last quick question. Do you guys have any manufacturing facilities
anywhere around the world that are currently at a higher risk of operational disruptions related to the
ebbs and flows of shutdowns and re-shutdowns and COVID transmission?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Matt, that's a good question. We spend a lot of time as a company making sure that health and safety
is the #1, #2 and #3 priority for us. And all of our factories compare best practices and all of them are
operating in a safe, healthy way. And so I don't see any greater risk in one place or the other because of
the great job the operations teams have done around the world.

cautious in their purchasing or whether that recovery is proceeding along with everything else in trucks?
And maybe a similar question for dump and other similar related markets to construction.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure thing. What we've seen is we're the leader in those segments with our great Peterbilt and Kenworth
products and DAF products, do a great job of our customers. And I would say that the vocational market
seems to be doing quite well. It's one of the places where people are spending money on their homes.
They're putting index, doing whatever they're doing. And so there's a lot of shipment of goods for home
improvement. There's a lot of construction still continuing. Housing starts are strong and so I think the
sector is really doing pretty well. There's -- oil and gas is down. But in general, the total sector is doing
really well.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research.

Joseph John O'Dea
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

First question, it's good to hear that pricing has been pretty stable through the disruption this year. I'm
interested in how you're thinking about the pricing opportunity next year as those build slots start to
open up in the order book. Whether or not at a below replacement demand type of outlook, you see an
opportunity to get price? Or if you think it's going to be more of a flattish kind of environment?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

I think people's pricing expectations are always that we would like to see our trucks continue to provide
great service. And as our trucks provide great service and low operating costs, they create a pricing
premium for the PACCAR products, and that's kind of the way we think about it relative to this quarter.
We'll see how the market develops as we look forward.

Joseph John O'Dea
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And then on the fuel cell side of things with Toyota selecting Hino for a Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell truck in
North America. Does that have any impact on what you've been doing on the hydrogen fuel cell work in
collaboration with them?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

No, it doesn't at all, right? I mean, Toyota is a great partner for us in developing these hydrogen fuel cell
products, and it's not an exclusive thing. And it will need -- the hydrogen fuel cell market will need a lot
of players and a lot of volume to make it commercially viable. So it's accretive to our business model with

Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess, more broadly on -- we talked earlier about some of the key
R&D spend going up into next year. I was wondering if you could spend some time talking about some
key programs that would be new and different that are of meaningful size that are getting folded into the
budget. And I assume some of the spend next year is also catch-up from this year. If you could maybe
dimension that a little more because it is a relatively big increase relative to this year. I'm just trying to
get at what that normalized rate would be over the medium term.

R. Preston Feight

Well, we have some really exciting -- happy to do so. We have some really exciting truck programs that
are ongoing right now that we'll develop further next year and will be looking forward to sharing those
with you when we -- when its time is right. We have engine development programs going on with our
high-performing diesel engine programs around the world. And then you add to that, the autonomy,

Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon with Wolfe Research.

Robert Hudson Salmon
Wolfe Research, LLC

A few kind of follow-up questions related to the fourth quarter gross margin outlook. Are you guys baking
in kind of a similar aftermarket sales growth rate as you were seeing in September for the fourth quarter?
Or is something different kind of baked in related to your outlook?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

The 12% to 13% gross margin, and like Preston said, it's that we're achieving the best margins in the
industry. And we're -- we expect to be in that range despite a mix of more truck and -- or at least more
Truck growth and Parts growth. I think you should think of Parts as being the same or a little bit up
compared to last year in the fourth quarter.

Robert Hudson Salmon
Wolfe Research, LLC

That's helpful. And then the comments that you guys had mentioned about sequential growth in deliveries,
was that -- it sounded to me like it was more of a comment related to deliveries per day. Would the
comment about sequential growth on an absolute level relative to third quarter deliveries in U.S., Canada
apply? Or is it too early to tell on that front?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

The comment on 10% higher truck deliveries was on the total number, not on a per day number.

we do have fewer working days in North America in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and
more in Europe, which is the case every year.

Robert Hudson Salmon
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then the final question I had is related to the charging infrastructure. When you think about
historical returns in your Financial Services segment, how should we think about kind of charging
infrastructure returns on the investment that you would expect to achieve relative to the broader financial

Our next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley.

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe just following up on that question. Could you just share with us how to think about the sequential
increase in deliveries between U.S. and Canada versus Europe for the fourth quarter?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, one way to think of it is that, Harrie outlined it really well, is think about the build days. What I
would rather say is there's build rates. Daily build rates are going up in all markets in fairly good manners,
and we think that, that could continue. And so that's the easiest way to think about it without getting
conflicted about the number of build days in the quarter. So build rates are up, markets are improving.
Trucks are doing really well. And we think we've got a good look at the future coming towards us.

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Got you. And then maybe just on the Parts growth. I think you had commented thinking that it
will probably be slightly up in the fourth quarter. I think you had previously talked about a lot of deferred
maintenance that was happening at this point. Do you feel like that's most -- that's largely caught up
and there's not much more deferred maintenance? And then if you can also just give us a sense of the e-
commerce platform. I think you had said it was up 20% in the first half of the year. Are you still seeing
those levels in the third quarter and into the fourth?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

I think the way to think about the Parts business right now is that there is strong truckload business
around the country, truckload, vocational. All those markets are doing well. When trucks are running, they
consume parts. So that's what's happening mostly. So that's why -- that's one of the reasons the Parts
business is doing good. And the other is, as we mentioned, we've got great distribution capabilities, which
means we're getting an increasing share of the market, the Parts business. The team's done a fantastic
job not just with proprietary parts, but with all make parts as well, our TRP brands around the world. So
that's contributing to the growth.

And then the e-commerce programs that we have put in place or they put in place are just fantastic
also, right? They just -- they help make it easier to buy parts through PACCAR. And that's what the
team is always focused on is making our customers' lives easier and doing a great job in providing that
transportation solution for them. They're really nailing it.

Got you. That's helpful. And then just lastly, just a follow-up to the comments about the Toyota-Hino
partnership. Can you just help us kind of understand when we're thinking about hydrogen fuel cell trucks
how much of it is the design of the truck versus the fuel cell provider that really is going to dictate the
difference in performance just based on the different prototypes that you have out there? And are you
guys also considering other fuel cell providers in addition to Toyota?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure. I would think about it as the fuel cell is a critical part of the business. The truck is a critical part
of the business. The integration of the 2 is a critical part of the business. Supporting them in the field
is a critical part of the business, the distribution. All that matters. And so we're paying attention to all
elements of that. And I guess, to your other question is, yes, we are always looking for the great partners
to work with. Toyota is a great partner. We're working with partners on battery-electric and we're always
looking for the right people to be partnered with to make sure our customers get the premium trucks we
