EXELON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to today's webcast. My name is Tamara, and I will be your event specialist today.
[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate
Finance. The floor is yours.

Daniel L. Eggers
Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance

Thank you. Good morning, Tamara. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter
2019 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief
Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of
Exelon's senior management team, who'll be available to answer your questions following our prepared
remarks.

We issued our earnings release this morning, along with the presentation, both of which can be found
in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we
discuss during today's call, contains forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various
risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors
and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's
8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to
differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.

Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP
measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings
release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measure.

I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter
earnings call. I'm going to start on Slide 5. On almost all accounts, we had a very good 2019. Exelon
Utilities and Generation remain focused on delivering for our customers and their communities. ComEd
had its best performance ever. The nuclear fleet had its best capacity factor and we delivered financially.

You can read the full year GAAP earnings were $3.01 per share, and the non-GAAP earnings were $3.22
per share, above our revised guidance range and midpoint of our original guidance range. Joe will walk
you through the financial details later in the call. I want to address the operational details as we go
forward.

Last year, Exelon Utilities invested $5.5 billion in capital and $150 million -- which is $150 million more
than originally planned. These investments were primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a
premier customer experience, improve reliability and resiliency, modernization of our gas system, resulting
in the best ever customer satisfaction at each of our utilities.

We had a productive year on the regulatory front. Pepco D.C. filed its first multiyear rate case, and
Maryland's PSC is moving forward with a multiyear rate plans. We received a constructive settlement at
BGE and at ACE. PECO's transmission formula was approved by FERC, and ComEd's formula rate provided
the third rate decrease in 5 years, helping to keep the average residential customer bill flat from where it
was a decade ago.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

On the policy front, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Illinois and New York ZEC programs.
New York State Supreme Court -- Superior Court affirmed the ZEC program, and New Jersey implemented
their ZEC program in the spring. Governor Wolf in Pennsylvania announced plans for Pennsylvania to
join RGGI, and the Pennsylvania State Senate passed legislation, setting a goal for electric vehicles and
deployment. FERC approved PJM's fast-start reforms. PJM filed its proposal to reform the reserve market
and scarcity rules. We made our commitment to grow the dividend by 5% annually through 2020 with the
Board raising the annual dividend to $1.53 per share in January.

We're good partners also with the communities we serve. Our employees volunteered a record-breaking
251,000 hours in 2019 . That's 11,000 more than in 2018. During National Volunteer Week, we sponsored
452 events in 16 states and 128 cities with 5,400 employees, which is another record. In addition, Exelon
donated nearly $52 million to charities and organizations throughout our footprint. We are committed
to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our nearly 33,000 employees. We were once again
named Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign. Our total
diversity supplier spend exceeded $2 billion for the third straight year, accounting for 27% of our overall
supplier spend. Exelon companies continue to prioritize partnerships with local-based diverse businesses
by offering development programs.

We also continue to be recognized for our environmental stewardship and were named to the Dow
Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row. We are focused on operating at world-class levels,
delivering on our strategy in supporting clean energy policies in their state. The hard work and the
commitment of our employees to provide safe, reliable power and natural gas to our customers led way
to the greatest performance we had in 2019. We delivered on our commitments to you, our shareholders,
but also our employees and our customers and our communities. However, this year was not -- last year
was not without challenges, including subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Northern
Illinois. As we said before, we are limited in what we can share about the investigation. However, I want
to reiterate that we are fully cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office and taking the situation very
seriously. The Board appointed a special committee to provide oversight of the investigation led by outside
counsels to determine if any changes are needed to ensure that, going forward, we operate at the highest
possible standards. At the end of [indiscernible] our commitments for 2020.

Turning to Slide 6. We're committed to operating our utilities at the highest levels for our customers. Since
2016, we have deployed nearly $22 billion across the utilities and plan to invest $26 billion over the next 4
years. These investments enhance reliability, resiliency and modernize our electric and gas systems. We've
been able to make these needed improvements while keeping the boards -- the bills affordable. The rates
in all our major cities, Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, are 13% to 18% below the average
for the largest U.S. cities and 2% to 7% below the national average. These investments are producing
tangible benefits for our customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest level it's ever been at each one
of our utilities, reflecting a strong system performance that has come from our investments. Frequency
of outages has decreased significantly, down near 50% at ComEd and 30% at PHI. Outage duration
has also decreased by 52% and 38% at ComEd and BGE, respectively. 2019 was the best reliability
performance for ComEd and the second best for BGE. On the gas side, PECO and BGE have replaced more
than 200 miles of cast iron and bare steel mains and nearly 30,000 metallic gas services in 2018. These
investments will help our customers' current and future needs while reducing gas leaks and greenhouse
house gas emissions.

Moving to Slide 7. Our states are focused on ensuring the electric and gas systems are ready to meet
the changing customer needs, more reliable and more -- and resilient and are prepared for renewables
in electric vehicles and are ready to meet the challenges of climate change. We are working with each
state to get the right mechanisms in place to be able to make these needed investments. Our states
are providing support through a range of regulatory tools, including alternate rate making, such as
formula rates and multiyear rate plans as well as tracker mechanisms for reliability and gas infrastructure
programs.

Turning to Slide 8, FERC's recent order on PJM capacity. The governors in Illinois, Maryland and New
Jersey are firmly committed to having their electricity be supplied by 100% clean. These states are leading
the way to a clean energy economy, and we share that goal, and we'll work with them to achieve it.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Unfortunately, there is a clear conflict between clean energy goals of our states and our customers on one
side and the resource decisions being made by PJM and FERC on the other. Unless states take action to
protect their clean energy programs, FERC's December order on the PJM Minimum Offer Price Rule, or
MOPR, will result in clean right resources supported by the states being pushed out of the capacity market
only to be replaced by carbon-based generation. This would result in billions of dollars of additional costs
for customers and threaten the progress being made in retaining and expanding our clean energy. Our
states as well as many others, oppose FERC's MOPR decision and are evaluating what actions may be
necessary in response. We are working with policymakers and stakeholders to protect the clean energy
programs from the negative impact of FERC's MOPR decision and enable the transition to 100% clean.

On Slide 9, we show our operating performance for the year. Each utility continues to have outstanding
customer operations, all achieved first quartile in performance and service level and abandon rate. And
I mentioned we had our best ever scores on customer satisfaction index with BGE, ComEd and PECO
achieving top decile, and PHI's performance significantly improved in the last 3 years, missing first quartile
by 0.01 points. Reliability performance was mixed this year due to a very active minor storm season
throughout the Mid-Atlantic. For instance, PHI had 32 minor storms for 2019 compared to 8 in 2018. Minor
storms are not excluded from these calculations. However, ComEd achieved top quartile in both outage
frequency and duration, and BGE achieved top quartile on outage duration.

Turning to generation on Slide 10. Our fleet -- generation fleet performed one of its best years ever,
very good in 2019, providing a significant portion of the country's clean energy. Exelon generates 12%
or 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the United States. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very
well last year. Our capacity factor was 95.7%, our highest ever. We generated 155 million megawatt
hours, avoiding 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2019. Our average refueling outage
duration was 21 days, matching the record set in 2018 and 18 -- 14 days better than the industry
average. Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 97.9%, and wind and energy capture at 96.3%
were better than planned.

Our Constellation business remains the industry leader. A vast majority of our retail businesses is with
C&I customers where we have the largest retail platform with 25% market share, delivering 154 terawatt
hours of electricity and 67 terawatt hours more than our nearest competitor. Our retail operating metrics
remain strong: 79% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than 6 years and
power contract terms of 23 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power
customers. Our focus is on cost and helping support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in
its durable relationship with our customers. We work with our customers to provide them solutions to
meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. We provide our
customers with much more than just a commodity.

And now I'll turn the call over to Joe to review the financials.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our 2019 results, annual updates to
our financial disclosures and 2020 guidance. Starting with Slide 11. We had another strong year. For the
fourth quarter, we earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.83 per share on a non-GAAP basis.
For the full year, we earned $3.01 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.22 per share on a non-GAAP basis,
which is above our revised full guidance -- full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 per
share above our original midpoint. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $1.91 per share, net of holding
company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to original guidance due to favorable O&M,
including the lack of major storms and favorable weather at PECO and BG&E as well as higher distribution
revenues of the BG&E. These were partially offset by the impact of lower treasury rates on ComEd's
ROE. ExGen earned $1.31 per share, exceeding its guidance range of $1.20 to $1.30 per share. ExGen's
outperformance was primarily due to favorable O&M, including incremental nuclear insurance distributions
and recognition in the fourth quarter of the research and development, or R&D, tax benefit for the years
2010 through 2018 tax years. We expected to record this benefit, but it was more favorable than we had

EXELON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

planned. This favorability was offset by the unplanned outages at Salem, Handley Station and a contracted
asset during the year. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.

Moving to Slide 12. The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.2% ROE for the trailing 12 months, up 90
basis points from year-end 2018. The improvement is driven by the constructive distribution rate cases
across the jurisdictions as well as incremental transmission revenue and a decrease in O&M, partially
offset by an increase in depreciation. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities were above 10%, slightly
improving from year-end 2018. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we earned a 10%
ROE for the trailing 12 months, which compares to last year's 9.6%. As a reminder, we targeted 9% to
10% consolidated ROE at our utilities and expect that we will move around in that band over the course of
time, and we remain focused on earning fair returns across all of our utilities.

On Slide 13, we rolled forward our outlook for utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2020 to 2023. This
year, we expect to invest nearly $6.5 billion in our utilities and a total of $26 billion over the next 4 years.
These investments are improving our system reliability, service experience for our utility customers and
preparing us for the future. Our capital forecast reflects identified and approved projects. As we move
through time, we identify more investment needs across the system that will provide additional benefits
to our customers and communities. Since the initial disclosures for the 2018 to 2022 period, we have
identified nearly $4.9 billion in additional investments, including an additional $1.9 billion since last year's
fourth quarter call. As Chris mentioned, these investments benefit our customers by helping to drive
our operational excellence, overall customer satisfaction and meet state resiliency and environmental
priorities.

Since the PHI merger in 2016, we have added more than $9 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over
the next 4 years, we will grow our rate base 7.3% annually to $54.2 billion, adding $13 billion to rate
base by 2023 or the equivalent of adding a utility between the size of PHI and ComEd without paying a
premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. As a reminder, 65% of our rate base growth is
covered under either formula rates or mechanisms such as capital trackers. These support our ability to
efficiently invest in our system while also allowing us to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where
we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely
recovery tools.

Chris touched on this earlier, but I want to remind you all that we have been able to make these important
investments while maintaining lower customer rates compared to other large urban areas. When we look
at our projected residential bills, we continue to see bill inflation around or below the rate of inflation even
as we make these important investments. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the
capital and rate base outlook for each utility, starting on Slide 23.

Turning to Slide 14. We continue to forecast strong utility, less holding company, EPS growth of 6% to 8%.
When you consider the drop in the 30-year treasury that lowered our EPS outlook for ComEd by roughly
$0.05 compared to what we had showed you last year, we've been more than able to offset in the back
end of our plan through the increased CapEx program across the utilities for the benefit of our customers,
which brings us to the durability of our industry-leading earnings growth, which reflects the combination
of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and environmental goals,
successful cost management and a focus on customer bill affordability.

Before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 15, I want to remind you that given the lack of clarity
around the outcome of legislation in Illinois and the fact that PJM has not yet held a capacity auction for
the 2022-2023 delivery year, we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021.

So turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or '21 from our last disclosure.
Open gross margin declined by $400 million and $100 million in '20 and '21, respectively, due to declining
power prices across most regions, offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million of
power new business in 2020.

We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 6% to 9% behind
in 2020 and 3% to 6% behind in 2021 by taking cross-commodity hedges into account. We continue

EXELON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or
volatility.

Slide 16 shows our O&M and capital outlook at generation for 2020 and 2021. Compared to our previous
disclosure on our fourth quarter call last year, our O&M is down in each year. The updated forecast reflects
O&M cuts we announced on last quarter call, pension benefits and nuclear savings. The return on our
pension investments in 2019 significantly exceeded our planned returns, but this favorability was partially
offset by the drop in the discount rate. Taking both into account our pension expense, it's about flat to
plan in 2020 and is down by approximately $25 million in 2021.

Turning to CapEx. We expect lower cash outlays than we projected last year. We have reduced the growth
capital in 2020 and 2021 given the focus of recycling ExGen cash and the increased need for equity
investments at the utilities given their growing capital needs. Nuclear fuel costs are also lower in 2020
and higher in 2021 versus last year's disclosure, primarily due to a shift in deliveries. Overall, we continue
to see a constructive outlook for the nuclear fuel costs looking out over our planning horizon. We will
continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend to improve the cash flow profile
of ExGen while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet.

Moving to Slide 17. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade
credit ratings. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics are consisting with our targeted ranges and above
S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target for 3.0x. For 2020, we
expect to be at 2.4x debt to EBITDA and 1.9x debt to EBITDA when excluding nonrecourse debt. This year,
we will be active in the capital markets as we support our utility rate base growth. At ExGen, we plan to
retire $1.5 billion of long-term debt this year, including the $1 billion maturity we paid off in January. As a
reminder, this is in addition to the $600 million of long-term debt retired in October of 2019.

Finally, I will conclude with our 2020 earnings guidance on Slide 18. We have provided 2020 adjusted
earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in utility earnings is primarily driven by the continued
increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as carry through
from the 2019 rate cases. We will see offsets from lower treasuries on ComEd's earned ROEs, higher
depreciation and some regulatory timing drags between investment and rate cases, most notably at PECO.
Our consolidated range in 2020 for utilities, less holdco, is $1.80 a share to $2.10 per share. The decline
in earned ExGen's earnings is a combination of lower realized energy prices and capacity revenues, more
planned nuclear outage days and the absence of nuclear decommissioning trust gains. These are partially
offset by a full year of ZEC revenues in New Jersey and increased ZEC revenues in New York. We expect
first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. More detail on
the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix, starting on Slide 55.

With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 19, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2020. We will continue to
deliver operational excellence across our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the
customer experience at our utilities while staying focused on safety and reliability. We will meet or exceed
our financial commitments, delivering earnings within the range and maintain our investment-grade credit
ratings, as Joe mentioned. At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $6.5 billion of capital to
benefit our customers and help meet the needs -- our states' energy policy goals, and we will work with
our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We will support the enactment of state and
federal clean energy policies with major initiatives in-flight in several states. We will -- and we will partner
and ally with the communities we serve. This is key to who we are.

Slide 20. I will close on Exelon's value proposition which highlights our strategy and commitment to
shareholders. We will continue our focus on growing our utilities, targeting 7.3% rate base growth and 6%
to 8% earnings growth through 2023, rolling forward another year at this above-group trajectory. We will
use free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down debt and support the external dividend.
We will continue to optimize the value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-

emitting generating fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets as we see value is there while
maximizing their value through generation to load matching strategy at Constellation. We will sustain
growth investment-grade metrics -- excuse me, strong investment-grade metrics, and we will grow our
dividend at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective in providing
tangible benefits to our shareholders. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and
earning your ongoing support to Exelon.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first response is from Greg Gordon with Evercore.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congratulations on a great year. The outlook is encouraging. A couple of questions. The utility growth
outlook has obviously improved as we go out through time despite the headwind from ComEd. The
CapEx is up significantly, but the rate base growth numbers look like they're not moving as much in
tandem. I skimmed through the whole deck. I understand you've also moved capital around the different
jurisdictions as well, but can you just comment on sort of that modest level of dissonance between CapEx
being up and rate base growth looking like it's not up as much?

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes, Greg. It's Joe. Yes. The issue isn't solely that the incremental CapEx that we mentioned of
approximately $2 billion isn't falling to rate base. It's about all of the CapEx, and what we get into is the
timing of when these projects go in service. So we've updated some assumptions as it relates to the
schedule of when the projects are finished and then they go into service. In addition to that, we could
have changes in things like depreciation that would also impact that, so it's really just a movement of
when we see project timing and other things.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Oh. So AFUDC is not -- or CWIP and AFUDC are not contemplated in that -- those calculations then?

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

No. They're not contemplated in that calculation.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. That explains it. In terms of the cash flow profile, I know that you haven't given us an update but
-- because we do have, obviously, significant uncertainty with regard to ExGen and Illinois. But as you
look at most scenarios there, whether it's getting some sort of deserved incremental revenue for the
clean attribute of your plants or having to use self-help to rectify the earnings issues, under most of those
scenarios, do you still see the utility being funded by the cash flow of the corporation without needing
equity through this forecast period?

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes, Greg. So the first thing I would say is based on the current plan, as I mentioned in my prepared
remarks, we don't incorporate any equity issuance in the plan. And going forward, we can meet the
funding needs and maintaining investment-grade credit metrics under most scenarios that we look at
because we do look at this under a range of different possibilities.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Just 2 more questions, and I'll -- they're quick. One, since the Q -- since the EEI deck where you
usually give us your update on where you think O&M and capital are driving it. At ExGen, things have

10

EXELON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

improved on the margin. Can you comment on how you've pulled forward some of those -- the O&M and
CapEx trajectory?

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes. I think the big thing is when you look at the improvement in ExGen earnings, it's really driven by 4
variables. As you could see in '20 and '21, the gross margin hasn't changed, right? But what has changed
is we announced the O&M reductions on the third quarter call. That's been a benefit. Property -- lower
property taxes has been a benefit at ExGen. Lower depreciation is also a benefit. And then finally, we do
have some lower interest expense when you think about the retirement of debt. So those 4 variables have
driven improvement to the ExGen earnings.

Gregory Harmon Gordon
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Final question, Chris. The time flies. It's like -- seems like yesterday since you made the
commitment to grow the dividend 5% through 2020. And here we are in 2020, and you've made good
on that commitment. At what point do you go back to the Board with a recommendation on the dividend
policy post 2020?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

So I would anticipate the discussions with the Board will be in the fall time frame when we have further
clarity on what the future looks like. If we are able to enact some of the policies and programs in the
states we're working on and it provides us with certainty that we can provide certainty to the Board that
maintaining the health of the balance sheet while creating shareholder value, we should have a better
picture at that time. So I would expect us talking to you around year-end time frame about that.

Your next response is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I had a couple of broader policy questions. We've certainly been seeing quite a bit of evidence of --
especially in the PJM states, a movement away from fossil fuels. And on the merchant side, I think I
understand some of the moving parts there. But on the regulated utility side, what is your sense of the
degree to which states are now pushing to move away from fossil fuels? And how do you think broadly
about pivoting and sort of reacting to you that shift at the utility side of your business?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

So as you know, Stephen, our utilities do not have any generation and are restricted from having
generation in the states that we serve. What you see in our planning years that you're looking at -- for
the utilities, they incorporate what we believe needs to be done to support the states' needs, which calls
for more robust distribution system investments to allow 2-way energy flows, which is going to require
transmission buildout to take care of importing the wind from the pockets of the service areas that we
serve. And that's what's anticipated right now in the capital plan that we have in front of you. We have got
to keep up with the state's policies, legislative agendas or whatever is going to change the system, so our
customers can benefit from these policies that the states are enacting.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. And then just shifting over to the PJM capacity process, I wanted to just get your latest
thinking on next steps procedurally. I'm thinking about sort of the broader process under which PJM would

refine their approach and the timing under which they have an auction. I guess I'm thinking also about
the possibility of pretty significant litigation around the -- whatever comes out of the PJM and the FERC
process here. How do you see that unfolding? Just wanted to get your latest thoughts there.

Kathleen L. Barron
Senior Vice President of Governmental & Regulatory Affairs & Public Policy

Stephen, it's Kathleen Barron. I can take that question. I'll start with auction timing. As you know,
there's a large group of stakeholders, including clean energy advocates, consumer advocates, renewable
developers, and most importantly, the states who have asked PJM to take their time in scheduling the next
auction. There's just been such a fundamental change in policy here that states need time to evaluate
what the impact is on their customers and to design appropriate policies to protect their customers from
the significant impact of this new policy on customer bills. So we, of course, agree with that perspective
and are going to continue to urge PJM when they're developing their next filing effort, which, as you know,
is in March, to propose an auction timing schedule that takes into account the states' needs.

And in terms of litigation, you're right that there have been a number of requests for rehearing that have
been filed. That would be the next step for FERC before this case could go to litigation. FERC has no time
line in which to ask -- to act on requests for rehearing, but I think the more important point is they have
been developing this policy for years. I mean they've laid out in an order in ISO New England 3 years ago
that MOPR is their standard solution, and they have carried that through to PJM. I see no future where
they change their mind on that policy, and I think, therefore, the states are right in looking at what their
alternatives are to continue participation in RPM.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. And just to follow up there, Kathleen, can the auction proceed if there is pretty significant
litigation from multiple states sort of questioning the fundamentals of the FERC order?

Kathleen L. Barron
Senior Vice President of Governmental & Regulatory Affairs & Public Policy

Well, technically, it can. I mean I think from a good governance perspective, of course, as I said before,
PJM should take into account the fact that some of the states need some more information to figure
out what the impact is going to be on their citizens. They're going to need to do an internal evaluation.
But from a legal perspective, the FERC order is final. And once the compliance filing is submitted and
approved, then PJM will be allowed to conduct an auction, unless there's some sort of judicial stay
imposed.

Can you hear me okay, Chris?

Christopher Mark Crane

Yes, perfect. Yes we can.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great, great. So just on the Illinois process, could you just maybe talk to, I guess, an update of the
legislation and just trying to make sure that -- I think the hope is that there'd be more of a long-term
framework in place for treatment of nuclear and renewables. And just how much is that likely to be part of
any legislative activity in the state?

EXELON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Well, it's definitely -- there's 2 focuses that Exelon has in the legislation. One is the ComEd side, ensuring
that we have adequate recovery mechanisms for capital investments being made while trying to maintain
the customer protections that we need by caps on bill increases. So that part is very critical.

Kathleen can address the Genco parts. She's been heading that up in Springfield, in and around the state.

Kathleen L. Barron
Senior Vice President of Governmental & Regulatory Affairs & Public Policy

Sure, Steve. I can jump in on the -- on your point about having a longer-term framework, which is exactly
the point of the legislation that's pending in Illinois. And the idea of using the Fixed Resource Requirement
provision in the PJM tariff or the FRR provision is to give states that kind of flexibility to provide, for
example, for renewables that may want to have contracts of differing lengths exactly that flexibility for
them to have those contracts. And likewise, for their broader clean energy goals for them to be able to
differentiate when they're procuring capacity resources between clean resources and emitting resources.
And having that ability to design their capacity procurement to meet their state policy on a longer-term
basis is one of the key benefits of the FRR strategy.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And any sense on when we'll get kind of a more -- kind of full bill with more details are proposed to
get a better sense on just the details of a potential bill?

Kathleen L. Barron
Senior Vice President of Governmental & Regulatory Affairs & Public Policy

Yes. I think you should expect to see further discussion and public hearings about what the bill should look
like. As you know, there are a number of proposals that are alive in the legislature in Springfield, and so
there needs to be some discussion in public hearings of how the state's policy on all the issues that are
pending will come together in a comprehensive approach. So I think over the course of the spring session,
those details will become more evident. As you know, in most legislatures, it usually takes until closer to
the end of the session for all the details to be worked out, but I think you'll start to see over the coming
weeks and months more detail emerge.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then a broader question just on -- I guess it's an ESG/nuclear carbon question. Just maybe for
Chris, just how do you feel about your ability to get credit? It seems like there's a lot of focus on ESG and
renewables and not necessarily as much focus on the benefits of nuclear and carbon reduction, as you
said, 12% of the megawatt hours you produced for the country last year. Just how do you feel that you're
going to be able to get credit, either Republican or Democrat, for the benefits of nuclear? Just how both
sides are kind of looking at that right now, including the FERC side.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think over the last 2 to 3 years, you've seen a greater recognition of the benefit of nuclear as it's
contributing to a cleaner environment, low carbon and also other emitting gases. So as we work with
stakeholders, explaining electrification and the benefits of electrification and that electrification is coming
from clean sources that are highly reliable, like baseload nuclear, there's been quite a few environmental
organizations and government legislative folks that agree with that. The dialogue is going on, on how
do we keep these assets so the states can make their goals, and that's going to be a critical part going
forward.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

We've shared numbers with you before that if we shut down a couple of nuclear units in a single state,
we can totally destroy all the investments that were being made in the renewables, and we're just going
to go backwards with our carbon emission. So we have to do our job as -- not only as a company but an
industry, and we're trying to do that.

The Nuclear Energy Institute has done a very good job on their campaign to communicate that to greater
and broader masses, and we'll continue to do it ourselves and work through things like the legislation that
may be enacted or policies that may be enacted in states. We've seen the ZEC and the recognition in New
York. We saw the ZEC and the recognition in Illinois. We're going to have to go a little bit further to be
able to save these plants, and that's where we're talking about FRR. And it's also -- another part of it is
it's more than just environmental. The reliability they provide, the jobs they provide, the economic engine
for the communities that they serve is very impactful. And to not have these assets or to be replaced with
carbon-based assets will just send the states, not only financially, but environmentally backwards.

Your next response is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just focusing a little bit on the Genco. If we get to sort of the November veto session and find energy
legislation gets pushed to '21 and we assume that there will be a PJM auction in, let's say, December and
January and another one roughly 6 months after that, can you just walk us through how you'd be thinking
about the auction participation and the timing of potential closures? And do you feel that the MOPR order
has catalyzed the states to act on CJC?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

We're not speculating right now on that. We surely hope for many complicated issues that the states
are able to enact and given time to enact the policies that they desire that will allow these plants to
still operate. I've said for the last 4 or 5 years on almost every earnings call that if we can't see half to
financial stability for each one of these assets that we will have to retire them, and we're not going to
speculate today on which ones or when. But we've shut down Oyster Creek, gone into decommissioning
with a decommissioning company. TMI is off. There was no path for financial stability. And as I've said in
the past, we must watch the balance sheet and our debt commitments, and the negative cash flow assets
will only send the fleet backwards, and our goals on strong investment-grade will allow us to maintain our
commitments to operate plants safely and meet our financial commitments on retiring our debt. So we'll
work hard through this legislative session to convey the importance of it, and we're not going to speculate
until we have no longer have a path to profitability for the assets.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then if, let's just say, Illinois does FRR, how are you thinking about maybe the potential
impacts on sort of the rest of the RTO fleet like in Pennsylvania and Maryland, especially given, obviously,
the IMM has been taken somewhat of a bearish tone on the impact?

Kathleen L. Barron
Senior Vice President of Governmental & Regulatory Affairs & Public Policy

Yes. Shar, this is Kathleen. I can take that one. I mean there are a number of estimates, as you know, out
there about the impact of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 states choosing the FRR option. We have not conducted an analysis
of what that means for the rest of the pool, so I'm not going to speculate on which ones of those analyses
are accurate. But I will just say, with respect to the market monitor and the suggestion that the MOPR
is going to have no impact on capacity clearing prices, it's -- and I note that that's been repeated by a
number of the fossil companies, yes, it's just -- it's a little bit concerning. I mean it's exactly these state
programs that they -- that were the reason that multi-litigation was brought by these companies.

Recall when the first lawsuit was filed in New York, when New York adopted the ZEC program, they said
the point of the lawsuit was that ZEC programs were suppressing market prices by $15 billion over the
course of that program's life. The whole purpose of MOPR was to raise capacity prices. Commissioner
Glick estimated that he's going to raise capacity prices by $2.4 billion annually across the pool. Other
independent analyses have gone there, too. So it's just not credible for them to be now saying MOPR is
going to have no impact.

Your next response is from [ Joseph Bukowski ] from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

It's Julien. Can you hear me?

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Super quick. Let me come back to some of the numbers that we start with Greg earlier. Just in terms of
the guidance, I know you mentioned the AFUDC and the reconciliation of the CapEx and rate base. Can we
talk about the earnings? Obviously, rate base, unchanged; EPS guidance, higher. Is that principally due to
some of these changes in AFUDC that isn't formally reflected in that rate base and obviously is reflected
in that CapEx? Or are there other changes? Obviously, the cadence of the trajectory of the earnings in '20
and '21 onwards has shifted a little bit as well but just wanted to clarify that.

And then also on ExGen, similar dynamic around what's causing the offset versus the open margin. I think
you had a little bit of a quick brief commentary about basis potentially. Just want to elaborate quickly on
that as well as maybe the tax piece for ExGen year-over-year.

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Yes, Julien. It's Joe. On your first question, remember, we're giving you guidance for the combined EU
and holdco, so there's a couple of variables, even though we're investing CapEx and rate bases are rising.
When you look at it, the interest rate -- the interest expense at corporate is projected lower, which drives
EPS as one variable that's positive to the earnings. We are -- when you look at these projects, right, you
could still see there is additional CapEx growth, and then we've had some improvement in ROEs versus
our prior plan as well based on some of the regulatory actions and performance. So there's a number of
variables outside just the incremental CapEx that would drive the value.

Your second question on the offsets at generation, it's -- when you look at the prices falling, use '21 as an
example, where we're less than 70% hedged. You see that you would have the open gross margin come
down. However, that's a price at a common trading point. When you look at the values associated back to
where the generator busbars are, for example, those prices move every day as well, and there were some
offsets associated with that. So that got us down to flat.

EXELON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 11, 2020

Got it. Excellent. And then just to come back to the broader strategic points here. At what point in time do
you need to make decisions here? It sounds like there's latitude through the course of this year. And then
related to that, are you expecting any kind of FRR developments ahead of these auctions themselves? Or
would the outcome of the auction and the outcome of any ultimate resolution of how to run this auction
prove to be a decision point for states outside of Illinois? I just want to understand the cadence of events
given where we stand today. I know there's a lot of moving pieces, and that could be a long question, but
I'll let you respond to as you peak that.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

We are definitely responding to the MOPR in our commentary to FERC in PJM if they need to allow the
states to enact whatever policy or legislation they are pursuing prior to running the auctions. There's
adequate capacity in -- within the system that we don't need to rush to secure it until the rules are
clear. So it would be an unfortunate event if the auctions ran before the states were able to take action,
which means you'd be looking at 2024, 2025 before you'd be able to enact, and that's a long time with
negative cash flows that many of the units would be facing at that point. So we want to work with every
stakeholder we can within the states that we serve to help them enact the policies and explain what
we can on the economics. If the bill, as we've seen it and draft towards the end of last year, is enacted,
it actually has a significant benefit to the consumer. It's not a bill increase as being communicated by
some are understood by others. It actually, as Kathleen pointed out, could cost as much as $2.6 billion to
the PJM customers. And you take just Illinois alone, that's about 15% or a little over $400 million on an
annual basis on an increase to those customers. So there's a customer benefit here. There's -- as drafted
or inputted previously, there is a cap on the -- and what can be increased on both sides of the investment
to support the renewables or the cost of the energy capacity in the system. So we need to be able to have
the time -- or the states need to be able to have the time, and there's discussion in multiple states right
now that they want to look at something differently. And we hope that PJM respects the states' needs and
allows them time to enact the policies that they desire.

Your last question come comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Crédit Suisse.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just maybe you could explain a little bit why the hedging program is still, I guess, a little bit more behind
ratable? And I guess you talked about not expecting a significant rebound in power prices going forward.
Just wondering what the -- what your thinking is.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll let Jim McHugh answer that.

James McHugh
Executive VP & CEO of Costellation

Michael, it's Jim. We have shifted our positioning in the markets through time. I think we -- at this time
of year, 18 months ago or even 24 months ago, we are carrying a position behind ratable, primarily in
the baseload regions, looking at the markets and where they were trading. What we've done is we've
shifted some of that to different regions. For example, one of the areas we've -- with a backward-dated
curve in ERCOT, for example, we see opportunities in different seasons in Texas with ORDC pricing being
more relative for the future. So there's just -- we're picking and choosing our spots, I would say, and it's
spread out across multiple regions. And it's just a smaller overall position, but we're looking at where the
opportunities are.

And then, not -- a little bit relative to your question, I would just highlight, too, that the vast majority of
our new business would not come from that type of optimization activity, but 70% to 75% would come

from our load sales and customer-facing business in retail and wholesale. So we see a good, strong
pipeline for those activities. And you saw the win rates and renewal rates that Chris spoke to during the
call, which is another opportunity for us to continue to make our new business targets.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Right. Still pretty well balanced. And on the capital program, would it be fair to say that it's -- that you're
being conservative on it given the uncertainty over PJM and CJC? Could the capital program actually be
higher next year, if we see some more resolution, more certainty over there?

Joseph Nigro
Senior EVP & CFO

Michael, what I would say is our capital program reflects what we think is the projects we've identified, as
I said in my prepared remarks, at this point in time. I think that you've seen the uptick in what we put in,
in 2019 versus what we're putting in, in 2020, and we'll continue to challenge ourselves for the benefit of
our customers. But right now, and I would tell you I think what we're showing you is a fair reflection of
where we are and what we expect to do.

Calvin G. Butler
Senior Executive VP & CEO of Exelon Utilities

Michael, this is Calvin. I would also say when you look at 2019, we added $150 million additional capital
all around gas, main replacement and really adding to the overall customer experience. And as we've built
out our plan, whether it's transmission or distribution, additional capital, it's all around meeting those
customers' expectations and our stakeholders' in terms of reliability and resiliency. So we feel we have a
solid plan and can execute to it.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

The only thing I'd add to that is, every quarter, we look at the total bill of the customers, and we're very
sensitive to making sure the investment is prudent. It drives efficiency, reliability and benefit to the
customer, and we also watch the affordability.

Michael Weinstein
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. One last question, Calvin. So the PHI multiyear rate plan filing for this year, are you guys -- would
it be fair to say that the ROEs tick up from the low 9s, could go up to the high 9s, if you get that approved
later on?

Calvin G. Butler
Senior Executive VP & CEO of Exelon Utilities

No. What we anticipate, we do not -- first, right now, we expect the DC Commission to come out with
a ruling in the fourth quarter of this year. And along the way, we've adjusted our ask in terms of those
multiyear plans. But we have a very solid understanding of what those ROEs are, so I'm comfortable with
where they are right now.

Christopher Mark Crane
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, and thank you for participating today. Before we end, I want to thank our employees for
staying focused on safety and delivering another good year, both operationally and financially.
