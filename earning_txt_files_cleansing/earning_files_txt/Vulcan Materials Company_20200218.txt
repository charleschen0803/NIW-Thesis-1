VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Vulcan Materials Company's fourth quarter and full
year earnings conference Call. My name is Kevin, and I will be your conference call coordinator today. As a
reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

Now I will turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan
Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin.

Mark D. Warren
Vice President of Investor Relations

Welcome, everyone, to the Vulcan Materials Fourth quarter and full year earnings call. With me today are
Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Suzanne Wood, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Today's call is accompanied by a press release issued this morning and a supplemental presentation
posted to our website. Additionally, a recording of this call will be available for replay later today. Before
we begin, please be reminded that comments regarding the company's results and projections may
include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks, along with
other legal disclaimers, are described in detail in the company's earnings release and in other filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures
and other information in both our earnings release and at the end of our supplemental presentation.

I will now turn the call over to Tom.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Mark. And thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest in Vulcan
Materials Company. 2019 represented another year of strong earnings growth and demonstrated the
strength of our aggregates-centric business model. But before we talk about our accomplishments for
the year, I want to spend a few minutes telling you about the good progress we made again in the fourth
quarter. Aggregates gross profit was $274 million, a 7% improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter.
Aggregates shipments increased by 4%, with markets in the Southeast and Southwest, reporting strong
growth.

For the quarter, freight-adjusted average sales prices increased by 5.5%. All key markets reported year-
over-year price growth. And the 70 basis point benefit from mix was due in part to above-average growth
in Gulf Coast markets that are served by our unparalleled logistics network. This growth is noteworthy.

The fourth quarter of 2018 made for a tough comparison with a 24% increase in aggregates gross profit,
8% growth in volume and 5% mix-adjusted price growth over 2017. Gross profit per ton in the quarter
improved to $5.32 and was negatively impacted by 3 things, most of which are timing and mix related.
First, repair and maintenance costs were higher in the quarter. As we said before, certain types of repairs
and maintenance are routine and scheduled therefore, the associated costs are more predictable.

Other repair and maintenance activities are planned annually, but the exact timing is more difficult to
predict with precision. We monitor the situation throughout the year to determine the optimal time to do
the work. And as a result, the cost can be lumpier. This quarter included several of these types of repairs.
In addition, the rigorous inspection and maintenance protocol that we rolled out as part of our operational
excellence initiative in early 2019, drove some of our costs higher in the second half of the year. We
expect to continue to see additional repair and maintenance costs in 2020 and have incorporated them in
our guidance. Setting high standards is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our business.

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Our employees are highly engaged and they're focused intently on the mobile equipment and fixed plant
inspection and maintenance aspects of this initiative. In doing so, we can preempt or avoid equipment
failures which could result in much more expensive repair cost.

The second factor that impacted our gross profit in aggregates was actual geographic mix versus our
expectations. Our fourth quarter shipments were robust in markets along the Gulf Coast, which are
served by rail and water. Remote served markets carry higher selling prices but also carry higher cost,
particularly if the tons are shipped by rail versus Blue Water. In the fourth quarter, higher volumes from
rail distribution, negatively affected margins.

The third factor was lower revenue and earnings from certain aggregates locations, which also generate
tipping fees on clean fill. This result was mainly a matter of timing of projects expected to contribute to
the fourth quarter. Instead, the projects were delayed, but will benefit 2020.

Finally, I'll also highlight our fourth quarter asphalt results, where gross profit increased by $4 million
compared to the fourth quarter last year. This was driven by a 10% improvement in shipments and a 3%
improvement in average selling prices. In addition, we experienced volume growth in California in spite of
wet weather in the fourth quarter. These volume and price improvements in addition to a 12% reduction in
the average unit cost for liquid asphalt drove a 52% improvement in unit profitability in asphalt.

Suzanne will share with you the detailed numbers in a moment. But first, I'd like to summarize our full
year 2019 accomplishments and talk about why we're excited about 2020.

Let's start with the most important aspect of our business, safety. In 2019, our people led us to another
year of world-class safety performance despite being busier than ever. We also completed the rollout of all
of our strategic initiatives: commercial excellence, operational excellence, logistics innovation and strategic
sourcing. We believe these initiatives will help us accelerate growth towards our long-term goals.

On the financial side, aggregates shipments grew by 7% and average freight-adjusted sales price was
5.6% better than 2018. Aggregates' gross profit increased by 16% and unit profitability grew by 8%. Cash
gross profit per ton was $6.74, another step forward on the path to our longer-term goal of $9 per ton.
And while our non-aggregates segment gross profit was flat year-over-year, the second half showed signs
of improving trends in the asphalt business.

Our adjusted EBITDA for the year grew by 12%, and importantly, our return on invested capital increased
to 13.9%. As a whole, we were pleased with our annual results, but we aren't satisfied with just setting
records. Our focus is on getting better every day and reaching our potential.

As we enter 2020, we are well positioned to take advantage of supportive markets and deliver another
year of double-digit earnings growth. Our markets will continue to benefit from both public construction
demand, led by highways, and a resurgence in demand on the private side, particularly residential. The
public highway demand is there as are the revenues to support the investment. As we've seen -- excuse
me, as we've said before, it's not a matter of if, but rather when the projects are finally started and
shipments begin. To be fair, we've seen -- we've been a little bit disappointed over the last couple of
months with the speed with which the states are letting work. However, we remain confident that these
projects are a go in the near to medium term with respect to residential demand, which we've been a bit
cautious, but now we're seeing a very positive turn in leading indicators, with Vulcan markets outpacing
the rest of the country. Underlying demand fundamentals, including population and employment growth
remain firmly in place and underpin our expectations of growth in private residential and nonresidential
construction. These demand characteristics are catalysts for a positive pricing environment in 2020 and
demand visibility is also an important contributor.

With our geographic footprint, focused on the higher growth markets, we are in the best position to
capitalize on public and private demand.

So what does all of this mean for 2020? We anticipate a 2% to 4% growth rate in aggregate shipments.
Aggregate-freight adjusted sales prices are expected to increase between 4% and 6%. Additionally, we
maintain our longer-term view of approximately 60% same-store flow-through rate to gross profit on a
trailing 12-month basis. Overall, we are looking at double-digit growth in aggregates segment earnings.

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Moving to our construction products segment. We expect 10% to 15% growth in gross profit collectively.
This contemplates relatively stable liquid cost in asphalt.

I'll now turn it over to Suzanne for further comments on our 2019 full year performance and 2020
guidance.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Tom, and good morning to everyone. In 2019, our aggregates volume growth reflected the solid
underlying demand fundamentals in our market, including growth in population, households and jobs that
is 2 to 3x that of other markets over the next 10 years. Shipments in certain markets in the Southeast,
Mid-Atlantic and Texas were particularly strong.

Average sales prices and aggregates increased and higher prices were widespread with all major markets
reporting improvement. For the full year, our costs were up 4%, contributing to a 48% same-store
aggregates flow through rate. As Tom mentioned, there were several factors that affected this rate,
particularly in the fourth quarter. Our segment gross profit increased by 16%. This continued progression
underpins our ability to deliver attractive earnings growth.

SAG expenses, while higher in absolute dollar terms, decreased as a percentage of total revenues.

Moving on now to the balance sheet, cash flows and return on investment, we made progress in each of
these areas. Our balance sheet structure remains strong, with a weighted average debt maturity of 14
years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. Leverage was reduced from 2.6 to 2.2x, well within
our target range.

We generated $820 million of discretionary cash flow, and we followed our capital allocation priorities to
determine the most shareholder return-enhancing use of that cash.

In 2019, this included investments and attractive growth opportunities as well as return of cash through
dividends and share repurchases. And as a result, our return on invested capital improved by 130 basis
points on an adjusted-EBITDA basis.

I'll move on now from 2019 to 2020. Tom has already covered the operational aspects of our segment
guidance. So I'll comment on a few other points. SAG expenses are forecast to be approximately $365
million in 2020. This represents a reduction in absolute dollars as well as a reduction in the ratio of
expense to revenue. We already have taken steps to ensure we are efficiently leveraging our overhead.

We anticipate that interest expense will approximate $125 million. And that depreciation, depletion,
accretion and amortization will approximate $385 million in 2020. And our effective tax rate will be
approximately 20%. The combination of these assumptions lead us to an adjusted-EBITDA range of
$1.385 billion to $1.485 billion for 2020. The midpoint of this range represents a 13% increase as
compared to 2019.

Moving on to our cash flow expectations remember that our business is an inherently cash generative one,
and 2020 will be no exception. We anticipate discretionary cash flow of approximately $800 million. As
you model our cash flows, I'll share some thoughts to help you fill in the blanks. As guideposts, we will
continue to adhere to our unchanged capital allocation priorities in directing our uses of cash, and we will
stay within our target leverage range. We expect cash interest expense of $120 million; operating and
maintenance CapEx of $275 million; and finally, cash taxes of $180 million. The discretionary uses of our
cash involve returns to shareholders, internal growth capital and acquisitions.

Let me cover each one of those. First, we expect to maintain a progressive dividend, generally growing
it in line with earnings to a level that is fully sustainable through the cycle. Second, we expect to spend
approximately $200 million on growth CapEx for projects that are already largely underway as we did not
spend the full amount of growth capital we projected in 2019. These projects include the opening of a new
quarry in California, capacity expansion at other quarries as well as improvements to our logistics and
distribution network and sales yards.

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

And third, we will continue our disciplined evaluation of acquisition opportunities as they arise, only
investing in those which fit our strategy and offer superior returns and synergies. And last, we will
continuously evaluate the use of opportunistic share repurchases as a means to return excess cash to
shareholders.

And now I'll turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Suzanne. Now before we go to Q&A, I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women
of Vulcan Materials, for their hard work and their dedication. They have taken good care of our customers.
And have improved our business processes and disciplines. Importantly, they have promoted our strong
safety culture and are responsible for delivering our industry-leading safety metrics.

As we move forward, we will continue to capitalize on our strengths, our aggregates focused business,
our outstanding geographic footprint and our local execution capabilities. We will also remain focused on
compounding our unit margins through the cycle and improving our return on invested capital.
Now we'll be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Our first question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel.

Stanley Stoker Elliott
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Tom, could you talk a little bit about the cost structure, kind of the puts and takes as we're heading into
2020? You mentioned some of that being planned in the current guide. Does any of this roll off? I'm just
trying to -- curious to see how you guys are thinking about the cost piece.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. If you look at the fourth quarter, the guidance cost or unit profitability was, as I said, was impacted
by 3 unique items and pretty much equally. All 3 of those items are somewhat a combination of mix and
timing. The first one is a large clean fill project, which we will -- we take dirt into the quarry for a tipping
fee. The job was temporarily stopped, but it will start back up in 2020. So we'll see that again. We'll get
that back.

The second item was really geographic mix. It was increased volumes to remote distribution rail yards
on the Gulf Coast, which is a good thing. It just comes at a higher cost for the simple reason that you
experience not only the quarry cost, but also the yard cost. And you couple that with -- we had a little bit
lower volumes in the Mid-Atlantic states, really due to timing of work.

And then the third item was increased equipment maintenance cost. It's really driven by our equipment
inspection efforts as part of our operations excellence efforts, which we kicked off in February of last year,
and this is really to prevent catastrophic equipment failure. It improves operating efficiencies and actually
improves customer service. And while the costs were higher in Q3 and Q4 because of these efforts, a long-
term focus on maintenance is just the right decision for the company. Now those efforts will benefit us
later this year as, over time, it improves cost by helping to eliminate expensive failure costs and really
the expense of downtime. And I would expect some of these costs to continue for a bit into 2020. But all
of that's built into our full year 2020 guidance. And I got to tell you, I'm very pleased. This takes a lot of
work and a lot of effort not pleased with our operator's performance here.

Stanley Stoker Elliott
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

No doubt. And sticking on the cost side, can you guys speak to the leverage you're seeing on the SAG
line? I wanted to call it SG&A. But I feel like that tracking below 7% of sales is maybe one of the best in
the company's history. Talk a little bit about how you're driving that down when your revenues are going
to be up double digits.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Sure. I'm happy to do that. Yes, the SAG area, which is predominantly corporate- and administrative-
type cost is an area where we are continually focusing our attention. If you look at the fourth quarter and
you look at the full year of 2019, while the absolute dollar amount is higher, we did reduce it -- those
costs as a percentage of revenue, and that's something that we have been really focused on as part of our
budgeting process and as we move into 2020.

I mean, look, the -- we want to make sure that we are delivering the appropriate services to our
operational folks, and we have looked across the footprint, particularly in those corporate and admin
functions for ways to be more efficient and effective in delivering those important services to people. And

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

sometimes, that is just finding more efficient ways to do things, sometimes it's using technology. You just
use a number of things at your disposal to try to effect some change. So you'll see those efforts which
have already begun. Some are completed as we speak. You'll see that reflected in the 2020 guidance. And
we are absolutely driving toward not just a reduction of those costs as a percentage of revenue, but also a
reduction in the absolute dollar amount. And we have plans in place to do that.

Operator

Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.

Trey Grooms
Stephens Inc., Research Division

So I guess I'm going to talk more -- or my first question is more around the volume. So on 4Q -- the
4Q volume, you did see a little bit of a deceleration there relative to what we saw in some of the other
quarters. And then seeing the volume going from 7% or so, I guess, that you put up in '19 in aggregates
to the guidance this year of 2% to 4%, as my first question. Can you talk more specifically about how
we get there? What your end market expectations are or your assumptions for your end markets, public,
private, nonres and residential that you have baked into that?

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

That's a good question. I'll just start-off with a gentle reminder about the tough comp that we had year-
over-year in fourth quarter, and then Tom can address some more specific comments. If we look at the
fourth quarter of 2018 from the revenue perspective, it was just a really strong quarter, and we had an
8% growth in volume, which led to a 24% in aggregates gross profit. So I think with the volume increase
of about 4% in the quarter this year, I mean, frankly, that's -- I think that's a pretty decent growth. It's
well within our guidance range that we set forward at the beginning of the year. And coming off a very
good fourth quarter we had last year, I'm not completely surprised by that.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I would add to that. The 2% to 4% growth in 2020, I think, is our trying to be thoughtful about taking
everything into account, demand, timing of shipments, weather, comparing it to 2019. So remember that
we saw a little bit slower starts and leading indicators on the private side and the third quarter, kind of
July to October. That has now picked up. It picked up dramatically. And it could flow through in part of
2020 as a short lull or it could just -- what we're seeing right now, it could blow through. We just don't
know quite know yet.

On the highway side, funding's up, demand's up and public works, for the first time, non-highway public
work is picking up. Still, there's quite a bit of unknowns about, again, about how fast the DOTs can get
jobs let and to work. The funding is there, but it will be about timing. I think we're also not going to have
-- as Suzanne, we're going to have a first quarter '19. Last year, we had a windfall. We were up 13%,
as we had pulled forward from the prior year. And then 2019, we didn't have any hurricanes or tropical
storms that impacted us in any material way. I think the 2% to 4% volume growth in our guidance is
a thoughtful approach as we pull all those factors together. I would point out in all of this, that we will
see growth in all 4 end markets and the one that's coming on and we're pleased to see is that the non-
highway infrastructure piece is now growing.

Trey Grooms
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And Tom, you mentioned the 1Q of '19 having a pretty good showing there with some
windfalls. How should we be thinking -- and maybe this is for Suzanne. But how should we be thinking
about the cadence there, the volume as we look in '20 in light of -- you have things like tough comps and
other things of that nature?

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

I think, as always, it's going to be timing related. It'll be -- the -- we'll have ebbs and flows with that, but
the -- it will be timing of weather and timing of large projects.

Operator

Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.

Kathryn Ingram Thompson
Thompson Research Group, LLC

First, focusing on Illinois, we are seeing a pickup in lettings in Illinois, I know you talked about lettings in
the prepared commentary. Focusing on that, how do you expect forward -- you're seeing work, what type
of projects and how big of an impact could Rebuild Illinois have a state that has relatively underperformed
over the past several years?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

I think -- it was hard for me to hear you. With your question, first of all, how is it in Illinois, and then what
would -- should we expect from highway working with -- how we're working with the highway bill?

Kathryn Ingram Thompson
Thompson Research Group, LLC

Yes. Really, what -- we've seen lettings. Are you starting to see work come from Rebuild Illinois? And what
are your expectations for future volumes as a state from this passed act?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

So I think that Illinois, I wouldn't -- we're not expecting a lot of that funding to flow through in 2020. I
think it's going to be more '21. We still have some of the toll work and airport work, which will benefit us
in Illinois in 2020. On the private side, in Illinois, it's probably not one of our strengths. It's probably one
of the few places we're probably seeing some weakness on that. So while the team in Illinois did a job
improving unit margins, they're not getting the benefit of big volumes. And I don't think we're going to
see the highway work in Illinois, much of it until '21. Am I answering your question?

Kathryn Ingram Thompson
Thompson Research Group, LLC

Okay. Perfect. Yes. Yes. No. That's helpful. That's helpful. And then also just following up on the rail
network, assume that most of the volumes are out of your South Georgia ops, could you give us --
confirm just any more color in terms of the type of projects that you're seeing that are driving demand in
the Gulf?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So it was -- in the fourth quarter, the rail work was really widespread, and it was really more timing.
We are pleased with it. It's good work. It just comes at a higher cost, but it was across the board. I mean
it was Texas, it was the Mississippi, Louisiana/Panhandle, South Alabama, even into Florida. We really just
had just had a good solid fourth quarter. And weather helped it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

I'm wondering if you could talk about the pricing cadence as we think about 2020 versus '19. Any
differences in timing of price increases that we should keep in mind? And can you comment on how broad
the price increases is in terms of breadth of markets as we think about '20 versus what you put through in
'19?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I would describe it as very similar -- 2020 will be very similar to 2019. We're continuing to see
solid price improvements at this point in 2020. We're very confident guiding to that 4% to 6% price
improvement for the year. Our bid work, our backlogs would support this, and our discussions with our
fixed plant customers would support this kind of pricing momentum. Again -- and we always point this
out, but we'll do it again. It's really underpinned by that visibility of the rapidly growing highway work
and a solid -- we think a solid performance will be seen in growth in the private side. And then again,
now we're starting to see growth in the non-highway infrastructure. While it's the smallest piece of it, it's
healthy. And I would tell you that we're going to see price increases across -- it's really wide spread, but
it's across every one of our markets.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

As it was in '19.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

And we'll have -- if you hit the pricing guidance, we'll have 2 straight years of 5% or so. Pricing gains. Is
that sustainable in the medium term? And obviously, you're looking for lower volume growth in '20 than in
'19. I'm wondering as we think about the medium-term outlook how would you counsel us to think about
sustainable level of long-term pricing gains?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Obviously, we're not going to give guidance past 2020. But I -- you saw it in '19. You're going to see it
in '20. I think the again, we've got long-term substantial highway funding coming and that visibility will
continue to grow. So that just supports the kind of pricing we're seeing.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. And lastly, in the past, when you had pricing momentum in aggregates -- in your asphalt markets,
you are able to achieve gross margin expansion, I think, at a faster rate than we can so far in the cycle.

Can you just comment on what's holding you back from achieving historical levels of gross margins in
asphalt in this cycle compared to the past?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Well, I think in -- as far as asphalt is concerned, we are guiding to non-air product lines being up
10% to 15%. Asphalt prices and unit margins are going to drive the big improvement that in asphalt. We
would expect gross profit in asphalt to be up double digit. That would be probably a slight improvement,
flat to a slight improvement in liquid costs. I think the good news is that the good highway work where
we experienced the big funds and the timing of that line up with our asphalt business. So if -- the story

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

in asphalt, I think, is this is we said, we -- all last year, we would catch and bypass liquid prices or liquid

Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Tom, I think you mentioned being disappointed over the last couple of months with regards to the speed
with which some states are letting work. I was wondering if you could just give a little more color on
which states you're seeing this and maybe the magnitude of the delays relative to what you were initially
expecting.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I would describe it this way. I think at this point, where we are in the year right now, we would expect
highway demand at this point be up, predict -- low single digit. Now that could move to mid-single digit,
depending on the timing of large projects and really state's ability to get work let and get work started.
As I said earlier, for asphalt, the good news is states where we have asphalt probably have the strongest
demand going into 2020, Texas, California, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee. But if the -- flip side of that
is places like Georgia and South Carolina, they struggled at the end of last year to get work -- to get
fundings let and work started. If you look at Georgia, we're still shipping 3 mega projects in Georgia. So
that's helping. But I would tell you that highway awards data starts have been a little slower. But then
again, lettings, they do ebb and flow. They come and go. All that said, I think that single digit -- that low
single digit could turn quickly to push us to mid-single digit. You got Georgia in the second half of '19,
where lettings were slow. Now Georgia in the first half of '20 is going to let $1 billion worth of work. Texas
is looking to double their lettings going into 2021. That's already healthy. It's at $7 billion going to $14
billion. California, we'd expect fund spending to go up some 13%, embedded in that is a 25% increase in
maintenance funding. And that maintenance funding could go very fast. All in all, we'll experience growth
in highways in 2020 and for years to come. And then I will give you a reminder that highway starts right
now while they've been maybe a little bit slower are up 20% versus where they were 2 years ago. So it's
growing. It's just how fast can the states get it to work.

Anthony James Pettinari
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then in the release, I think you made some reference to concrete
project delays. Can you talk about where you saw these project delays and the magnitude and whether
you expect this to kind of continue into 2020?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. They -- we got delayed 2 places. It was timing of big projects in Virginia. And then it was both
weather and fires in Northern California, where we got hit with -- on the volume piece of this. I would
expect volumes in concrete in 2020, up mid-single digit and recovering in both those markets. I would
expect prices up probably mid-single digit, and I would expect unit margins in concrete up double digit.

Our next question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Tom, just to follow up on one of the prior questions around the state lettings. What's your sense of
just the underlying fundamental cause for the slower pace of lettings? Is it a worker shortage? Is it

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

something in terms of the -- just getting things through the regulatory bodies? Just a little more color on
the underlying root cause there.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I don't think it's external factors outside of the DOTs, it's really them being able to -- they got a huge
slog of funding. They got to mature into that, and you've got to get it estimated, permitted, let. We've got
engineering that goes into it. So there's a lot of work for those BOTs to put projects out. While everybody
has the pressures of workers and employment, this is not what's holding up the lettings. It's just this
holding up of the states, it's just their ability to get that work planned and out and let and put to work.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

Particularly as some of the projects are larger caps than they had been in the past. The larger the projects
that just adds a degree of complexity to the process.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Second question, just thinking about the incremental margins, if I look at 2019 and -- on the whole, the
difference, if my math is right in terms of the incremental margin and what you would target on a 60%
would be about $60 million in EBITDA. And so I understand some of the one-time issues or transitory
issues that you've been talking about, but it's a pretty big number. And this isn't a year where you had
everything kind of working for you in terms of volume, price and your internal initiatives.

So as we go into '20, I guess, what I'm getting at is really just -- what's giving you the level of confidence
that you can get back to the 60%? Is it actually volume was too hot in 2019, and so as you go into '20,
the stripping costs aren't as high or just trying to understand that bridge a little.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I will comment first, and then I'm sure Tom will have a follow-up comment. I can't say I'm quite sure
about your math on the $60 million. But with respect to the 60%, that is -- and we say this often, that is
a long-term average. You're going to have some quarters and some years when you hit it. Some quarters,
you're below it. We have had a couple of years where we were just above that. In fact, if you just look at
2019, for the trailing 12-month period ended in September, we were right at 60%. So I think when you
look at the flow-through for this year, it really does revolve around those 3 items that Tom called out. Had
it not been for those, we would have been much closer to that number. And some of those were timing
and mix related. And to the extent it's timing and mix related, you won't have that pressure into 2020.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think fundamentally, this is not an inflationary issue. It's more about timing. We talked about the
remote distribution. That's a good -- that's really good because it's more volume for us. The [ field ] work
will come in 2020.

As far as what we did in Q3 and Q4 was stripping and preventive maintenance. I think those are just good
operating disciplines. First of all, the stripping is an investment. And it's -- while it's cost, you're -- it's a
onetime thing for a while as you develop pits and get ready for future volumes, which we think are going
to grow. On the maintenance side, it's really about -- we want to control our equipment, don't have the
equipment control you and make sure you do in a timely manner. Let me just give you like a real-life
example of that. If you were to take a 7-foot cone crusher down due to oil samples, it costs you $50,000.
If you wait until it failed, it would cost you $150,000. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of cost because
now you're taking the plant down, which is very expensive. And if you look at underneath that where we
are from -- really important metrics like tons per hour through a plant downtime or tons per man-hour,
you're seeing improvement. It's an investment.

Our next question comes from Rohit Seth of SunTrust.

Rohit Seth
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Just curious on -- if residential construction grew faster than you expected in 2020. Would there be any
ASP or mix benefits remaining on the cost side?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

No. I think it would -- residential has a good mix of both base and [ clean ] stone. I think it would flow
through like everything else. Although -- and that is something we'd love to see. So we got our fingers
crossed, but I wouldn't expect any big price-mix change or unit margins mix change.

Rohit Seth
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then on your incremental margins, just kind of building on some of the things you've already
said. But I mean, the last 3 years, it's come under the 60%. I'm curious how much of equipment failure
has been part of that issue.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think as we do that, we talk about same-store. And same-store in 2018 finished 65%. 2019 was --
so we have years at up, we have years below, I think, as you look at it. And I would point out to you the
same-store. And you could have times when it's higher, you're going to have times when it's lower. We'll
guide you back to the 60%.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

I think the other thing -- I'm sorry, I was just going to add. I think the other thing for us is the real
question, as we look through some of these fourth quarter cost is, is there something there that is
indicative of a significant shift in the cost performance of the company? Is something going on there
that has materially changed the cost structure of the company. And that, to me, would be the real
important sort of carryforward question into 2020. And again, as we go back through those items, our
view internally, as we've talked a lot about them, is no that there isn't something that is a significant
change in the cost structure of the company. And for that reason, even though there can be some volatility
in it between quarters or years, we, on a long-term basis, guide back to a trailing 12 of 60%.

Rohit Seth
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Yes. Understood. And then on the M&A pipeline, can you maybe provide any thoughts on what you're
seeing out there, and maybe your appetite?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. As always, we've got some projects, both large and small, that we're working. Again, as we'd always
tell you, it's discipline. Everything does not fit us. It's got to be unique to have synergies for us. Have the
discipline that if it's too expensive, we'll be able to walk away from it. And really, importantly, is once you

Our next question comes from Michael Wood of Nomura Instinet.

Michael Robert Wood
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

I was hoping you could quantify the repair and maintenance a little bit more. Curious if you could tell
how much it is as a percentage of COGS. And should we think about this as a purely variable next year in
terms of increasing alongside volume or could it maybe decline after being elevated this year?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

I think what we would guide you to that this is that I think you may see a little bit more of this in the
first few months of the year, and then I would expect it to level off to meet the guidance that we've given
you. And I would call that out as both some stripping and some repair and maintenance. But I think we're
confident as we look at our hand for the full year guidance of how that flows through -- our cost flows
through for the year.

Michael Robert Wood
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

Okay. In 2019, I know you were talking about throughout the year, or earlier in the year, some lower mix
stone going in on some of the larger highway projects. I'm curious if you can give us an update on that.
Has that continued? Or are you seeing kind of mix up as those projects mature?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

I think what we saw in -- the mix that we saw in the quarter was a little bit of geographic and a little bit of
product mix. As what we called out, I think, was that for the year, our performance was right in line with
guidance: full year was 5.5%; mix-adjusted, 4.8%. And it was an impact of asphalt sizes and really driven
by highway work, geographic mix, a little bit higher volumes on the Gulf Coast and the southeast.

VULCAN MATERIALS COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Yes. Good question. I would expect -- first of all, you've got a really tough comp in Q1 because volumes
last year were up 13%, and it was really that you had to pull forward from '18 into '19. And other than
that, I would call it one of timing of large projects and timing of weather. And we also had a very -- the
weather in the first quarter of last year was, with the exception of California, was quite good.

So -- and you guys can look outside and see what's happening right now with the weather in the first
quarter of this year. So all in all, I think it's timing of weather and large projects.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And Tom, you're not calling for any delay of larger projects at this juncture, which you can't predict at this
juncture, if I'm interpreting your comments...

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So we're shipping a lot of big projects right now. We called out 3 in Georgia. We've got a number
of different places. I believe it's going to be how fast the highways can get the jobs let into work. We
talked about that a little bit whether it was fast or was slow at -- what we called out was Georgian, South
Carolina, which saw in the second half of last year's lettings, which flow into 2020 is slow. But the first half
of this year, they got huge lettings. So we'll see how fast the work gets started.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then based on your guidance for your downstream business for 2020, it's a touch below
what you thought, actually coming into 2019 initially, just given some of the project delays you saw last
year and frankly, a more manageable liquid asphalt price environment. I'm a little surprised you're not
expecting more strength. Can you give us some of the puts and takes?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think what we see is real strength in unit margin improvement in asphalts and up double digit.
We're calling for liquid being flat to slightly down. And our volumes are just up slightly. And the -- that,
again, will be determined by the timing of this DOT work and how fast it gets started.

You got to remember, we had 2 -- we had big projects in asphalt and Tennessee. We had the big 202
project in Arizona, which neither one of those are repeating going into 2020. So they were windfalls in '19,
that are not going to repeat. Even with that, we're seeing slight improvements in volume and for that to
get much bigger -- they'll have to accelerate work is in some of the lettings that I talked about.

The thing I'm encouraged about, I said in asphalt, is you saw those margins turn in the fourth quarter,
we have been predicting that, kind of chasing that through the year in '19. Now we see, we carry that
momentum into 2020.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And just one clean-up question, Tom. When you said flat to down liquid costs. Are you calling sequentially?
Or is that more on a year-over-year -- on a full year basis?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

As a comparison year-over-year. But I think -- importantly, with that, we're going to manage what -- no
matter what happens with asphalt, we're going to manage the unit margin that asphalt appropriately. So if
the liquid prices fall, we'll see that accretive to unit margins. And like I said, the good news is we caught it
and keep growing it. And I think we'll see that as we continue to perform in 2020.

Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke of Deutsche Bank.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Could you just give us a sense of how the margin differs on your shipments by rail? And is this a dynamic
that's coming solely from higher demand in these particular areas? Or has the cost of service provided by
the rails change with some of the ongoing initiatives that they've been putting into place?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. I would point out this way. In general, the rail tons, it is going to be a little lower margins where --
and that's a higher price, higher cost, a little bit lower margins, but very good margins. So it's good work.
I mean the volume being up is a good thing. I would point out that in contrast, the Blue Water tonnage is
at much higher margins. It would be higher priced, higher cost and higher margins than the whole. So --
and what we saw in the quarter was just the timing of good work along the rail that happened to ship at a
high rate.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. So nothing to do with them putting persistent rail place...

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

No.

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

No.

James Thomas Hill

And the simple thing with quarry cost versus rail distribution. You got a the -- you have the rail distribution
plus the quarry costs. It just comes at a higher price and a higher cost.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then just a question on the 2020 guidance. There's about 700 basis points of differential
in the high and low end as it relates to year-on-year growth. Could you just give us a sense of maybe
what's embedded in the low end of guidance? And what would you really need to see to hit the higher end
of that range?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

I think I would tell you it's probably going to be mostly volume. I go back to timing of shipments. I go
back to -- do we get hit with a tropical storm or 2 or 3? Those would be the big variables, I think, between
the high end and the low end and how it lines up would be the delta.

That's right. And that's a very similar approach to what we took at the beginning of 2019 when we gave
the volume guidance then, a range of 3% to 5%. Luckily, and happily, we wound up being ahead of that
for the year.

But Tom's right, it really comes down to what happens with the timing of shipments and weather as to
whether you're at the lower end or the higher end. And as Tom said, we'll continue to watch with interest
how residential -- how those starts continue to improve throughout the year.

Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Loop Capital.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Just one more -- so just wanted to follow up, just on the highway outlook, this being an election year with
the FAST Act expiring in the fall. Do you think that could lead to additional letting delays in 2020? Just
curious of how these factors might play into the highway outlook and some of the sluggishness that you've
been seeing.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We've talked about the cadence and the highway lettings and some that are -- they've been slow and
now coming on strong and the timing of it. I wouldn't think the election year would have any impact on
state DOT lettings in the least. I don't think it's going to have -- it won't -- for sure, we'll have an impact
on the FAST Act or funding from the Feds. I think people watching are working hard towards the highway
bill, a lot of progress made on that, both on the bill side and the funding, I expect to get a highway bill in
2020. At the same time, when the FAST Act expires, I don't expect any of that funding to go down. We'll
just do extension. So I don't see a big impact on -- I don't see any impact on state DOT lettings due to
this being election year.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just given some of the repair and maintenance costs here and some of the other items
that you called out. Is this all, just to be clear, within your plan as you think about your $2 billion EBITDA
target you laid out at your Investor Day and thinking about how that could be potentially achievable once
you reach 230 million to 240 million tons of volume?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. If anything, I think that the 4 strategic initiatives, including the operations excellence initiative are
giving me more and more confidence in our ability to get to the $9 that we planned. I think that our
operating -- if you look -- if you were to look beneath the surface in our operations, while the headline is
higher stripping and repair and maintenance costs. Behind that, I think you're doing the right things in
investing in the business for the long term.

Really importantly, though, is you're starting to see the key operating parameters, which we measure
things like tons per hour, throughput through individual plants, downtime individual plants, tons per man-
hour individual plants, we're starting to see improvement. I think we are teaching our young people,
the right things to do. We are leveraging the collective knowledge and experience of Vulcan across 350
plants. So while we see some headline things, the ultimate work that goes into this from those initiatives
is starting to gel. The commercial excellence initiatives is mature. It is working. And we're very pleased
with our progress there.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Just getting back to the 2% to 4% volume guide, and just a question, I guess, on construction capacity.
And if we get a large increase in awards and lettings, what are the downstream bottlenecks that most
concern you as a constraint to your volume growth? And how have you accounted for that as a potentially
conservative element within your guidance?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, first of all, for Vulcan internally, I don't think we see any bottlenecks. We can handle it. We'd love
to see it grow as much as it could, and we'll be there, both from an aggregates perspective, an asphalt
perspective or a concrete perspective. On -- as far as if lettings were to increase dramatically, I think what
you see is the work would happen. The big bottleneck, as always, that people ask about is labor. The labor
shortages, to answer that question is, yes. I don't think it's going to hold up work getting done, but I think
it will hold up is ability to catch up once work gets delayed. So if you had a month in the wintertime, which
was all rain and really cold, trying to catch that up or if you had a big tropical storm come through, it's
going to take you a little longer to catch it up just because they don't have the firepower to do it fast.
That's how I would describe it.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. Have you factored that into your guidance, is that an element and potentially the discrepancy
between 2% to 4%, which seems fairly conservative versus the story, which seems pretty bullish?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

I think when it comes to volume, as I said, we tried to pull all those factors as compared to last year, the
pull through, the weather aspect of it. A little bit of an air pocket and leading indicators in the rail side and
the timings of highway lettings and state's ability to get that work. And we put all that together and the
upside potential, the risk piece of it, that's where we got -- we try to be thoughtful about 2% to 4%.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Yes. That makes sense. And then just a second question on mix. And just if you could talk about the
pace of growth in your backlog. And is your backlog building faster in your higher-margin products and
geographies?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

I think how I would describe this. I think when we looked at the 4% to 6%, as best we can. If you take a
mix of products of, when I say mix, both geographic and product mix together. I think we have seen good
improvement in base in our backlogs. We've seen good improvement in clean stone in our backlogs and
our booking pace right now as we look at it, both in price and in volume will support our guidance.

'19, with -- which was very good weather, and we had the windfall or pull forward of 13% volume from
the year before. I don't think you'll see that pull-through. You guys can look outside and know what the

Adam Robert Thalhimer
Thompson, Davis & Company, Inc., Research Division

And then, Tom, can you walk us through the demand you're seeing right now in California and Texas?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. I would describe California this way, I think that the -- well, let me start with Texas. The public side
is very strong. The TxDOT has done an excellent job of lettings and getting work out there's big work. This
shipping right now, there's big work on the horizon. And as we said, next year, they're going to go from a
wow factor of $7 billion to $14 million. On the private side, I would describe North Texas as being driven
by nonres. I'd say res is fairly flat with some exceptions of some big development North Fort Worth. South
Texas housing, strong; nonres, a little bit soft; coastal Texas, everything strong. And you could see some
LNG work start on coastal Texas in the second half of 2020, a little bit going now. California, Northern Cal,
public is very strong, both for aggregates and asphalt; private side looks good, maybe a bit flat in the
Bay; non-res is a bit soft, but leading indicators were improving; publics on Southern California, again,
public, very strong; highway, strong; non-highway is strong. On private -- single private -- in Southern
California, probably a little bit of watch for us with leading indicators a bit -- were a bit soft, but the last
3 months of indicators were up over 20%. So all in all, I think, pretty healthy growth in both states. And
I would tell you that I would expect good margin improvements -- unit margin improvements in both
locations, both in aggregates and asphalt.

Our next question comes from Adrian Huerta of JPMorgan.

Adrian E. Huerta
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Quick question. On cash taxes, can you tell us how they ended last year because I believe they probably
ended way below what you were expecting early last year? And why now you're back into expecting $200
million. And if there's any chance that, that could be lower than your guidance?

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. And the main reason for the reduction in cash taxes through the year was that as we started the
year, we had not made a determination as to whether we were going to take advantage of the bonus
depreciation or not, that's a calculation that we have to go through each year because there is some
interplay between it and a depletion allowance that we get when we file our tax returns as well as some
other things. So there's an actual -- while it might seem obvious, you would want to take advantage of
the bonus depreciation, there's actually a calculation that you need to go to ensure you are selecting
the calculation methodology that gives you the most tax benefit. So we started out the year under one
assumption, we determined in the second quarter and called this out at the time. That we were indeed
going to take the bonus depreciation that resulted in -- for 2019, us paying quite a bit less tax than we
had initially intended. And the estimated -- the cash tax rate was between 7% and 8%.

As we start off in 2020, we are guiding to an effective tax rate of 20%. We'll go through the same process
again and make a determination as to what depreciation methodology we're going to use. So there's some
chance the cash tax may be lower, but we will work through that process in a similar fashion that we used
this year, even under the assumption of having higher cash taxes in 2020 as compared to 2019, I'd just
point out, we still would throw off about $800 million of discretionary cash flow. So very, very healthy,

very substantial, and that $800 million could be put on a discretionary basis toward our growth projects,
potentially M&A if something comes along that meets all the criteria, that Tom outlined, dividends and
share repurchases.

Adrian E. Huerta
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That was very clear, Suzanne. And if I may ask another question. Can you share with us any details on the
quarry that is expected to open in California in terms of when and the size and potential volumes on an
annual basis that, that quarry could take?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So it's in Frisco, we're not in -- we probably won't open until beginning of next year, probably first or
second quarter of next year. Size, we're not going to actually disclose that at this point. When we get a
little closer to it, we'll talk about those things. It's in a very good market. It has taken us some 10-plus
years to get this done. The team has worked very hard, and now they're working hard to build it out into a
market that is -- it is very healthy and quite profitable.

Adrian E. Huerta
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Excellent, Tom. So it's a totally new market for you?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

No. It's a market we've been in before.

Our next question comes from Paul Chabran of On Field Investment Research.

Paul Chabran
On Field Investment Research LLP

First of all, closing the rail deliveries. I think you talked about that extensively already. So my apologies if
you have answered. But how should we think about it for 2020, the evolution of rate deliveries? Is there
any chance that it could impact your margins as it did in Q4 2019?

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

I'm sorry, the beginning of your question, I couldn't hear.

Paul Chabran
On Field Investment Research LLP

The question was related to the evolution of rail deliveries in 2020, how should we think about that? Is
there a change that could impact your margin as it did in Q4 2019?

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

The repairs and maintenance, is that what you're asking about? The connection was a little poor. I just
couldn't hear. I'm sorry.

Paul Chabran
On Field Investment Research LLP

Yes. Apologies. It's concerning the rail deliveries, they [ don't defense ] rail deliveries that had an impact
on your margin in Q4.

James Thomas Hill
Chairman, President & CEO

I wouldn't expect -- the rail happened to be a timing issue of big shipments in the fourth quarter, and I
would not expect -- I think we've got those -- the volumes that we do out of those -- that rail distribution
network embedded in our 2020 guidance, and that would see very little impact.

Our next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.

Brent Edward Thielman
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

This one is just I think for you, Susanne. Just on the SAG expense. Can you help us understand the
sensitivity to growth this year? In other words, if things really line up well through the year, you start
seeing 5%, 6%, 7% volume growth. Can you sustain below SAG 2019 levels?

Suzanne H. Wood
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think we can. As I said, this is a matter of what's driving that cost reduction year-over-year, where
the changes we talked about. Some of that is being more efficient in the way we do things. So it's not like
it's a variable kind of expense. It's more, what I would call, on the fixed side that we are making some
changes. And so I think that, that would be sustainable, yes.

James Thomas Hill

or closing remarks.
