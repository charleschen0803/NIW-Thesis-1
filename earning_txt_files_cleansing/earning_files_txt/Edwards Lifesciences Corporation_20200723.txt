Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Edwards Lifescience Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference
Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now
turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You
may begin.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Diego. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike
Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the
close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2020 financial results. During
today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying
financial statements and then use the remaining time for Q&A.

Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates,
assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and
expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation,
reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as
of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them
after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to,
those associated with COVID-19 pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information
concerning factors that could cause these differences and important safety information may be found in
the press release, our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are
available on the company's website at edwards.com. Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms
underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are
referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during this
call are included in today's press release.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Mark. Before we get into the specifics of the second quarter, I'd like to make a few comments
on the overall environment and how Edwards is striving to deliver during these challenging times. There's
no question that the world has changed considerably as a result of the COVID pandemic. However,
some things haven't changed, most importantly, our patient-focused strategy and our aspirations as a
company. At Edwards, our dedication to providing innovative solutions for people fighting cardiovascular
disease remain central to our credo. Our aspiration to excel as a trusted partner and to foster an inclusive
culture where all employees grow and thrive is stronger than ever. And our desire to improve access
to our therapies for underserved and undertreated patient populations around the world motivates our
14,000 employees every day. An unfortunate consequence of the intense focus of the pandemic during
the first few months was that many patients, like those with structural heart disease were not treated.
One interesting published source highlighted how the COVID-19 surge in March and April overwhelmed
Dutch hospitals and undermined regular ongoing care. In this study, they estimated there were more --
there were approximately 10x more healthy life years lost from regular care not being delivered compared
to COVID life years lost during that period. Closer to home in the U.S., recall that the data published
in the annals of thoracic surgery suggests that patients waiting for aortic valve replacement had a 4%
mortality at 1 month, 8% at 3 months and 12% after waiting 6 months. The provider community is
aggressively and creatively adapting to be able to treat COVID patients, while at the same time, providing
the necessary care to patients with life-threatening underlying conditions. We'd like to thank all the
health care providers on the frontline who've had to face the challenges of COVID-19 without a road

map. And who have made difficult decisions and innovate at the same time to provide the necessary
quality of care for patients in need. While the number of COVID cases remains a priority for providers, we
observed already in Q2, providers are adapting to ensure treatment of their structural heart patients. As
alarming as COVID is, AS remains a deadly disease and treatment delays will inevitably result in increased
mortality for a condition which has proven therapies with excellent clinical outcomes in the case of TAVR,
also minimal use of hospital resources. Even with the heroic efforts of the health care community, we
know that this remains a very difficult time for the patients we serve as they continue to weigh the risks
of COVID-19 against the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease. Edwards is committed to
providing the opportunity for faster procedures, shorter hospital stays and exceptional patient outcomes.
Irrespective of the unpredictable surges of this deadly pandemic, there is a growing recognition that valve
therapy should not be postponed. Not all procedures are the same. Valve replacement therapy is less
elective, and these patients have a more urgent need. We have found ourselves more aligned than ever
with the interest of patients and providers during this challenging time.

Now turning to the second quarter. Despite challenges related to the ongoing pandemic, we're pleased
to report much better than expected second quarter results. Sales of $925 million exceeded the top
end of our April guidance of $700 million to $900 million, driven by the continued adoption of our life-
saving technologies around the world. This performance was made possible by our dedicated team, which
includes our committed field organization and our global supply chain. Sales were balanced across all
major geographies and benefited from improving month-to-month trends as we progressed through
the second quarter. We also started to gradually resume patient enrollment in clinical trials that were
slowed at the end of the first quarter, and we're working with additional centers as many are now ready
to reengage. Furthermore, at TVT Connect and the virtual EuroPCR last month, we highlighted positive
clinical results in multiple breakthrough therapies. Even though many on our team were working remotely
during Q2, we made positive progress on a number of very important new technology milestones that will
be detailed later in our comments. Finally, we were pleased for recently announced intellectual property
agreement, which allows us to fully dedicate time and resources to helping patients.

In TAVR, second quarter global sales of $594 million declined 11% on an underlying basis. Globally, our
average selling price remains stable as we continue to exercise pricing discipline. As noted on our first
quarter call, sales were severely depressed in April as provider turned their attention to the pandemic
response. However, we were encouraged by the steady improvement in procedure volumes throughout
May and June when approximately 90% of our active sites performed TAVR cases. This is a testament to
the dedicated heart teams and our committed clinical field teams. We hear from a number of clinicians
that new patients are increasingly entering the system as they seek treatment for severe aortic stenosis.
We've seen a significant improvement from the steep trough in April. To put things in perspective, during
the second quarter in the midst of the onset of this tragic global pandemic, there were more than 20,000
patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN technology. In the U.S., our TAVR sales
declined in the low teens versus last year. As expected, April marked the most severe month year-over-
year. U.S. TAVR sales declines and procedure rates remained highly variable across the country. In the last
week of April, we observed the first signs of recovery and in May and June, we experienced a significant
step-up in procedure volumes as previously screened patients who temporarily delayed treatment, began
to return. Recently, we submitted additional data supporting the safety of our SAPIEN 3 platform in
bicuspid patients. And based on these data, FDA has approved the removal of the precaution from the
labeling. Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our TAVR sales declined in the high single digits year-
over-year on an underlying basis. In Europe, the pace of recovery was faster than expected despite
difficult early headwinds from COVID-19. In Japan, second quarter procedures were less impacted by
COVID-19 than initially expected. Aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease in that
region where Edwards is very focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy. It's also worth noting
recent TAVR approvals outside the U.S., last month in China, Edwards received regulatory approval to
begin treating patients suffering from severe AS and at high-risk for open-heart surgery with SAPIEN
3. We look forward to partnering with hospitals throughout China to introduce this therapy. Earlier this
month, Australia joined the list of countries that approved our SAPIEN platform for treatment of severe AS
patients, independent of their risk score. We believe these approvals represent important milestones for
patients outside the U.S.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Now shifting gears to our latest TAVR innovation, SAPIEN 3 Ultra, clinical feedback on improved
paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding. Last month, at the virtual TVT Connect conference, a
propensity matched analysis of 1,300 patients was presented using data from the TBT registry to compare
outcomes of patients treated with SAPIEN 3 Ultra and SAPIEN 3 valves. This was the largest analysis of
TAVR outcomes with Ultra, to date. Both valves demonstrated outstanding outcomes for paravalvular
leak, with Ultra redefining the benchmark for transcatheter heart valve technologies moving forward.
This analysis indicated that 90% of the patients treated with SAPIEN 3 Ultra had no reported paravalvular
leak at discharge. We are also very encouraged by additional data in the study, which confirm SAPIEN's
ability to facilitate a more expedited in-hospital experience for patients. This included fewer ICU stays,
with over 40% of the patients requiring no ICU time at all and shorter total hospital lengths of stay with
approximately 50% of patients discharged within 24 hours and 80% by 48 hours. In Q2, Ultra accounted
for approximately 40% of our U.S. and European TAVR volumes, up from 30% at the end of the first
quarter. You'll recall that we temporarily paused SAPIEN 3 Ultra proctoring at centers that were not
already trained on the device, and we resumed training in the second quarter.

In summary, while the sharp decline in April was not as prolonged as we expected, we continue to
envision a second half similar to our April expectations. Although there continues to be a high level of site-
to-site variability, based on our second quarter performance, we now anticipate global TAVR sales growth
for 2020 will be at the high end of our previous range of minus 5% to plus 5%. Based on how we've begun
the third quarter, we continue to expect in the third quarter -- we continue to expect sales in the third
quarter to be approximately flat to our strong 2019 third quarter and a fourth quarter that transitions to
growth over 2019. Furthermore, as patients and clinicians increasingly choose TAVR, we remain confident
that the opportunity will grow to over $7 billion by 2024.

Turning to TMTT, which is the transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies for patients suffering from
diseases of these heart valves. In the mitral position, we're developing repair therapies with PASCAL
and Cardioband as well as replacement therapies with M3 and EVOQUE. In the tricuspid position, we're
pursuing the PASCAL and Cardioband repair therapies and today, we are announcing a pivotal trial of
EVOQUE for tricuspid valve replacement. We have early commercial sales in Europe with several of
these therapies and we're advancing each of these platforms, including 5 pivotal studies underway in
the U.S. We continue to be very pleased with our robust, real-world evidence with PASCAL mitral repair,
as highlighted during a presentation at virtual EuroPCR. The analysis of more than 1,200 commercially
treated patients demonstrated an excellent safety profile and confirm that significant reduction of mitral
regurgitation can be achieved after only a short learning curve for physicians. As previously announced,
we're pleased to have received CE mark for PASCAL repair system for the treatment of patients with
tricuspid regurgitation. Based on our early and positive class tricuspid EFS data, we have initiated an
introduction in Europe with a focus on excellent outcome for this new tricuspid repair therapy. Last quarter,
we announced a temporary pause of new enrollments for our active mitral and tricuspid pivotal clinical
trials. In consultation with investigators and hospitals, more than half of our trial sites have begun -- have
been reactivated and are beginning to treat patients. We anticipate enrollment in our 3 class studies will
continue to ramp in the third and fourth quarter, and we're still targeting U.S. approval of PASCAL DMR in
2022.

Now turning to replacement therapies. We're encouraged by the early clinical experience with EVOQUE
tricuspid in 25 patients recently presented by Dr. Neil Fam, which demonstrated 100%, 30-day survival
as well as very significant acute reduction of tricuspid regurgitation and improvement in functional status.
We're pleased to announce that we've received approval to initiate a pivotal study for the EVOQUE
tricuspid replacement system, which is designed to gain U.S. approval and has breakthrough device
designation from the FDA. The TRISCEND II study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, pivotal
clinical trial to evaluate the EVOQUE system compared to optimal medical therapy in patients with severe
TR. In mitral replacement, we continue to gain experience with SAPIEN M3 and EVOQUE. Both systems
utilize a transfemoral delivery approach. We are encouraged by the early experience with EVOQUE in
patients with severe MR and high surgical risk. Additionally, we anticipate enrollment in our SAPIEN M3
pivotal trial to begin by the end of the year. Second quarter global sales for TMTT were $6 million. We
expect to progressively ramp in Q3 and Q4, and as we activate more centers in Europe and they resume
procedures and patient referrals increase.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

In summary, we reiterate our confidence in the long-term opportunity in TMTT and are passionate about
the significant progress we're making in bringing solutions to these deadly diseases to improve patients'
lives around the world. We continue to expect total TMTT sales this year to be $30 million to $45 million.
In Surgical Structural Heart, sales for the second quarter of $161 million declined 25% on an underlying
basis, primarily related to the impact of COVID-19. This was better than our expectations back in April.
The ongoing adoption of TAVR also contributed to U.S. surgical aortic valve procedure headwinds. Despite
the decline in Q2 sales, we are encouraged by the recovery of procedure demand as we progress through
the quarter, increased and improved management of ICU capacity as well as prioritization of heart surgery
in many hospitals, continue to -- contributed to rebounding case volumes in late Q2. We continue to
be encouraged by the steady adoption of our most advanced resilient tissue technology in the Edwards
portfolio. Our INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic tissue valve grew in both new and existing sites in the U.S. and
abroad, driven by increasing demand among younger and more active patients. INSPIRIS is becoming
the surgical valve standard of care in many geographies around the world and remains the #1 implanted
surgical aortic valve in the U.S. and Japan. We recently gained U.S. approval and treated our first patients
with our second resilient offering, the preassembled, ready-to-implant KONECT RESILIA aortic valve
conduit. KONECT combines our leading RESILIA surgical valve technology with a proven surgical graft.
This combination allows for the treatment of complex patient anatomies where it's necessary to replace
a valve and repair the ascending aorta. Elsewhere in the surgical structural heart portfolio, recently, the
first commercial cases of a Harpoon were successfully completed in Europe. This beating heart mitral valve
repair system offers the potential for earlier treatment of degenerative mitral valve disease with faster
recovery and more consistent outcomes for surgical patients.

In summary, we continue to expect Surgical Structural Heart sales for full year 2020 will decline 5%
to 15% in 2019. Localized hotspots could continue to limit hospital capacity, slow disease diagnosis
and impact patient willingness to undergo treatment. However, our expectation is that the recovery
experienced in late Q2 will extend in the U.S. and Europe into Q3. We continue to anticipate that in Q4,
our sales will return to positive growth driven by the market adoption of our newest technologies. We're
excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for patients and extend our
global leadership in premium Surgical Structural Heart technologies.

In Critical Care, second quarter sales of $164 million decreased 10% on an underlying basis. Increased
demand for our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU remains strong, but were
not enough to offset the COVID-driven impact of delayed elective procedures. Soft global demand was
also partially offset by large orders in Europe associated with ICU capacity increases. We also experienced
a decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S. as hospitals continued to limit their capital spending as a
result of COVID-19. Toward the end of the quarter, however, we started to see positive signs of recovery
in demand for our products used in cardiac surgeries, while demand in products used in more elective
surgeries remains depressed. We'd also like to highlight the recently announced collaboration between
our Critical Care team and the Anesthesia Quality Institute. The main focus of this shared initiative will
be to improve data collection and analysis of intraoperative hypotension, which, according to research, is
associated with poor clinical outcomes. We're optimistic this joint effort will result in the advancement of
patient care through the use of enhanced data collection to create updated guidelines.

In summary, we now estimate that Critical Care sales growth will be negative for 2020, largely due to
anticipated reduced capital spending in the U.S., but still within our previous guidance of minus 5% to plus
5%.

Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to make one last comment. We realize it's difficult to predict the
progression of COVID-19, including additional waves and isolated flare-ups and the associated impact
on the health care system. We are planning on dealing with the ups and downs of this pandemic for the
foreseeable future. Because of the severe condition of the patients we serve and our strong patient-
focused team, I remain confident in our ability to continue to successfully deliver during this global crisis.

And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Thanks a lot, Michael. Today, I'll provide additional second quarter...

Operator

This is the operator. We can't hear Scott's voice coming through.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

So let me start over again, just in case you missed that. Today, I'm going to provide additional perspective
on the second quarter, along with some indicators of how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold.
Our sales performance in the second quarter was better than we expected because the trough was not as
deep as we anticipated. April was the weakest month of the quarter, and we saw sequential improvements
in May and June as hospital procedure volumes started to recover. Earnings were also stronger than
we expected, both because of the stronger top line as well as because of constrained spending. We
implemented cost control measures, but we intentionally did not take any actions to significantly impact
our employees or reduce investments supporting our long-term strategy. This allowed us to deliver an
adjusted 25% operating profit margin and adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of $0.34,
which was 26% below last year's second quarter. GAAP earnings per share was negative $0.20 as a result
of the intellectual property agreement, which I will address in a few minutes. A full reconciliation between
our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share is included with today's release. And now I'll cover the details
of our second quarter results as well as discuss guidance for the balance of the year.

For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 74.4%, down from 76.4% in the prior year
quarter. This year's rate included incremental costs associated with responding to COVID and a negative
impact from foreign exchange. In the second half of the year, we expect to see a less pronounced impact
from COVID on our gross margin compared to the second quarter. Selling, general and administrative
expenses in the second quarter were $275 million or 29.7% of sales compared to $308 million in the
prior year. This reduced spending resulted from COVID, which interrupted our planned flow of operating
expenses. As I mentioned earlier, we did not initiate any actions to significantly impact our employees
nor to reduce investment plans supporting our long-term growth strategy. Research and development
expenses in the second quarter were $182 million or 19.7% of sales compared to $192 million in the
prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of high clinical spending in the prior year for PARTNER
III continued access as well as for CENTERA, and pause clinical trial activity this year due to COVID. We
expect R&D expenses to resume sequential growth in the second half of the year. As Mike mentioned,
earlier this month, we were pleased to settle the TMTT intellectual property matter. This impacts our
income statement as well as our cash flow statement. The principal impact to our P&L was a $368 million
pretax charge in the second quarter. In addition, we will incur a total of approximately $100 million in
royalty expenses between now and May 2024, which will be recorded in cost of sales. The cash flow
impact includes a onetime $100 million payment to Abbott made earlier this month, along with quarterly
payments in future years.

Turning to taxes. We had negative earnings in the second quarter due to the special settlement charge.
As a result, we reported a $46 million tax benefit in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of special
items, our tax rate was 8.2% for the quarter. This unusually low rate included an approximate $20 million
benefit or $0.03 per share from the accounting for employee stock-based compensation. The stock-based
compensation benefit was in line with our expectation. We continue to expect our full year 2020 tax rate,
excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%. Foreign exchange rates decreased second quarter
sales growth by approximately 1.1% or $12 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now
expect an approximately $30 million negative impact or about 1.0% to full year 2020 sales versus 2019.
FX rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 50 basis points compared to
the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates had less than $0.01 impact on earnings per share
reflecting our effective currency hedging program.

Turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and
investments at the end of the quarter. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit of up to $1 billion.
Our public bonds of approximately $600 million don't mature until 2028. Additionally, we continue to
generate healthy cash flows. Average adjusted shares outstanding in the second quarter were $630 million

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

on a post-split basis, and we expect average shares outstanding for the full year to [indiscernible]. Recall
that in June, we increased the number of shares outstanding by executing a 3-for-1 stock split. Adjusted
free cash flow for the second quarter was $123 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of
$231 million, less capital spending of $108 million. We are not updating our free cash flow guidance for
the year, although we continue to expect that it will fall short of our original expectation of $1 billion to
$1.1 billion.

Now I'll turn to guidance for the full year 2020. Our guidance assumes that the worst of the COVID
financial impact to Edwards is behind us and that we'll see a progressive recovery during the second
half of the year, anticipating that we'll be dealing with ups and downs along the way. Remember that
Edwards' sales grew 19% in the second half of 2019, so we have high year-over-year comparisons. Even
so, we expect total sales in the third quarter to return to 2019 levels and for sales to start growing again
in the fourth quarter. So while the second quarter sales decline was less severe than we expected, our
expectations for the second half of the year haven't significantly changed from earlier guidance in April.
We estimate total company sales growth for the full year to be approximately flat to 2019 with a range
of minus 5% to plus 5%. We now estimate TAVR growth to be at the high end of our previous range
of minus 5% to plus 5% and Critical Care growth to be negative for 2020, but still within our previous
guidance range of minus 5% to plus 5%. Surgical growth remains in a range of minus 5% to minus 15%
versus 2019, and we continue to expect that TMTT sales will be $30 million to $45 million. Full year
sales guidance for the total company continues to be $4 billion to $4.5 billion. And for the third quarter,
we estimate sales of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share
guidance range to $1.75 to $1.95 on a post-split basis, up 11% from our previous guidance of $1.58 and
to $1.75 or on a pre-split basis, $4.75 to $5.25.

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mike.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Scott. I want to conclude by, once again, expressing our gratitude to our clinician partners in
the global health care community for their tireless dedication to serving patients during this challenging
time. We appreciate their strong leadership and brave commitment to patient care, and we're dedicated
to supporting them as they address this global health crisis. I also want to recognize the extraordinary
actions that our employees around the world have taken to overcome the unique challenges associated
with COVID-19. Edwards is proud to be a member of a critical health care infrastructure and I admire the
agility, resourcefulness and passion of our employees in maintaining their important work on behalf of
patients.

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.

Joshua Thomas Jennings
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

It's great to see how effectively you've navigated through the pandemic. Maybe I could just start with
2 questions on TAVR. First, taking your U.S. TAVR and European TAVR results and matching against our
assumptions for the April and May decline. It seems that those units may have already returned to growth
in June. Did the U.S. or EU TAVR businesses return to growth in June or even in the first weeks of July
here?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. In general, we'd rather not get into the week-to-week and month-to-
month expectations. We've been encouraged by the steady improvement in procedures across all of our
businesses that we progressed through Q2. The specifics on June sales are not likely to be as helpful, as
they probably include working down some backlog in addition to new patient screenings. So -- and as we
said, based on how we've begun Q3, we continue to expect sales in Q3 to be approximately flat to our
pretty strong 2019 Q3 and the Q4 is going to transition to growth over 2019.

Joshua Thomas Jennings
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up, it would be great to get any data points that you can share
regarding those 2 elements you just talked about in terms -- it might be important for the pace of
recovery from here. First, where do you think centers are in terms of working through the COVID-19-
induced TAVR backlog? And then second, are you seeing evidence that new patient screenings in the
referral channel is revving back up in step with the TAVR case volumes?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Thanks, Josh. So we've heard anecdotally of many centers who have already worked off their
COVID-driven backlog. And as you may know, some centers operate with no backlog at all. The reason
that some of the backlogs didn't grow is that when treatment stopped, so did screening. Now this isn't
true all over the world. We know of some centers outside the U.S. where the waiting lists have gotten
longer, and they're likely to get worked down over 2020. But in the U.S., we don't think that there's
much of a backlog at this point. And unfortunately, due to the deadly nature of severe AS, some of these
patients who delayed treatment may never be treated.

Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Mike, just maybe one more specific one on TAVR and a follow-up on mitral. Just in terms of this recent
resurgence, I think investors are very focused on the specific areas, Texas and Florida, and the age of
these patients, has there been any sense in your mind in the month of July or late June, specifically in
July, that this resurgence in some of these key geographic markets, has that had any impact on trends
here in July?

Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, David. Yes, we have heard anecdotally of cases being canceled in places like Texas and
Florida and some of the southern states. But then again, as we mentioned, we had a chance to sort of
see how Q2 finished and see how Q3 started. And that's kind of built into our guidance. We anticipated
there were going to be some levels of ups and downs. And so when we project the Q3 that we think is
approximately flat to 2019, it takes that into account.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Very helpful. And then as it relates to TMTT, with the lawsuit resolved and I know you kind of
reiterated your TMTT guidance for the year, but if I could, with the lawsuit resolved, does the PASCAL
strategy ex U.S. change in anyway, as it relates to either the spending associated with the launch, the
breadth of the launch or the pricing of the valve in ex U.S. markets?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, David. No, broadly, there's no change in the strategy. We continue to have a lot of confidence
in this platform. We will continue to offer at a premium price. We're very pleased with the way it's been
performing, and we were happy to see that 1,200 patient experience reported at the virtual EuroPCR. One
of the reasons why there's no real changes, we really try and focus on great outcomes, and so we're very
deliberate about training center by center across Europe as we implement. And so you can see more of a
continuation of what you've seen in the past.

So one, if you could, just on you mentioned rebuilding the pipeline and sort of improving clinic visits. And
I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the role that some of the newer technology investments
that you made over the last couple of years and partnerships with some of the technology companies that
have fit into this sort of telemedicine model, either CardioCare or Eko? Maybe talk about the role that
they're playing, if any, at this point in helping to close that gap? And then I had one follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem

Okay. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, the newest technologies are not quite ready to have a broad impact. But one
of the things we've seen is an incredible amount of agility and creativity on the part of the heart teams to

make things happen. I mean, obviously, we tried to support them along the way. But they just pivoted.
They find ways to get patients in. They found ways to bring patients to a safe place, to do a work up. They
found ways to do some things virtually that they had always done in person. So it was remarkable to us to
observe sort of a pivot on their part to make it happen.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. So a little more hustle maybe to get that done, it sounds like, for now anyway. And then the other
is, you gave some color on the number of centers performing TAVR procedures. I'm wondering given that
new center growth has been such a big part of this market over the past several years, if you could talk
a little bit about maybe the way in which some of the new centers are responding or staying in on trend,
on pace, how they're being affected, if differently than some of the larger academic centers and how you
expect to -- that to kind of play out as we get further into the recovery?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Matt. So things have been very different by region of the world and certainly, region of the
country. In terms of the new centers, they didn't have a tremendous impact on the second quarter. Most
of it came from centers that were already in place. And again, we've had a chance to spend time with a
number of hospital CEOs, and we've been impressed that they just set their mind to trying to make a pivot
and be able to treat structural heart, in particular AS patients, during this time. So I think the last time
that we addressed it, Matt, we said there were about 700 U.S. centers and that we were headed toward
850. I think COVID does slow that down some. So it will continue, but it wasn't a big part of the story in
this quarter.

implicit in the guide?

Yes. Bob, you know what we're dealing with right now. There's so much uncertainty associated with the
progression of COVID. It's very difficult. We're being somewhat courageous here to offer guidance at
this point, with the uncertainty in front of us. So we're not ready to dial-in to anything very specific. We
do have the confidence to say -- no, we really believe we're going to be in growth mode, but we're not
prepared to get that precise.

Okay. And then just one question on China. Just curious, how you're thinking about the ramp in TAVR in
China. If you could maybe talk about how you think about the market opportunity? And especially how
much of an infrastructure do you think exists in China and how big an opportunity you think that could be
over the next 12 months? Obviously, a nice opportunity long term, but just curious about the ramp.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Bob. We're really looking forward to launching in China. Our belief is that there were maybe,
I don't know, 2,400, 2,500 cases performed in 2019. So a nice opportunity. And it's been served almost
exclusive -- or not almost, but exclusively by local companies. We're going to come in with a very different
kind of approach, where we really focus on outstanding outcomes. We're going to try and really service
those accounts. We're going to try and train them and make sure that they have great proctoring and
support along the way. So we're not expecting this to be a fast start. Matter of fact, it will be slow and
deliberate. We don't expect it to have an appreciable difference on our 2020 performance, but we really
like what it could do on a long-term basis.

Robert Justin Marcus

Congrats on a much better-than-expected quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about global pricing
and competition for a minute. I know you said your ASP globally was stable. Are you seeing any of your
competitors or are you, going forward, pursuing any major changes to pricing or strategy that you're
seeing?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I can't say, Robbie, that we've seen anything that's major during the quarter. So we feel like much
of it has been somewhat consistent to what we've seen in the past. We continue to be very disciplined
ourselves. I'm not positive exactly what other competitors are doing, but I haven't heard anything that's
particularly noteworthy.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. Congrats on getting the bicuspid warning -- or not warning, but
a negative suggestion removed from the label. How should we think about that in helping your adoption in
low-risk here, where it is more important?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks. So I think sometimes there was a misconception. We were never contraindicated. There was
just always this notion that we didn't have the data that demonstrated safety. So now with the data that's
been submitted, we're in a position there's no longer that safety concern. I don't know if it makes a big
difference. We have routinely treated these patients right along. And so it's a positive for patients. We're
not expecting it to have a big difference on our future volumes.

One on TAVR, Mike, one on TMTT. So Mike, early on, you talked about doctors adapting to COVID. And
given the shorter length of stay with TAVR, do you see COVID accelerating the transition to TAVR from
SAVR? And I had one follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

No. Thanks, Larry. Yes, no, we really don't see that. You probably imagine what would be going on in
2020, if it wasn't for COVID, we would be enjoying, we think, some pretty hefty double-digit growth rates.
And so no, COVID's not -- we don't see it as an accelerator, but we've been so impressed by the ability of
the system to adapt and find ways of treating COVID patients and their AS patients.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And Mike, I didn't hear you reiterate the $3 billion TMT (sic) [ TMTT ] market in 2024. I apologize if
I missed that. But is that -- did you not reiterate it? And is the market developing slower than you
expected? Or is just COVID may be pushing that $3 billion market size out a year or so?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It's a good question, Larry. We're not prepared to update how big we think the TMTT market is in
2024. You can tell we continue to be really excited about it. We wouldn't be putting this kind of energy into
it, if we didn't think it was a big opportunity by '24. And that's just the beginning, it's going to get much
bigger beyond that. But you'd have to say that given it's a developing market and it needs clinical trials
for it to develop that COVID is somewhat of a setback. We'll see what it is. We're hoping that it's pretty
contained but we're not prepared to update any thinking at this point.

Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just had a follow-up on the prior question about adding centers. I mean, could you just give us any color
on how many centers have been added in the recent period? Are you able to do that? Or are hospitals
really focused on managing patients and managing COVID. Can you talk about when that will resume?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Matt. I don't know the number, but my -- I would say it's really low. I don't think that new
centers were trying to do TAVR during the onset of a global pandemic. I mean it just wasn't there. So it
wasn't really much of a factor. There may have been a few that I'm not aware of, but I think it was an
obstacle for people to start to add bigger issues.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And just related to this a little bit, is the idea that as an incumbent and a market leader, does that
give you an advantage during the COVID period because doctors don't want to train on new things or
necessarily fuss with new or less-proven things or smaller companies?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, there may have been some advantage that we're the incumbent. But maybe the
bigger issue is that we've got some really trustworthy and proven results. We've got -- people can count
on the SAPIEN platform in terms of how it's going to perform. They don't have to worry so much about a

pacemaker that's going to mean the patient has to stay in the hospital longer, very little chance of ICU. So
they just have more confidence in the system. And frankly, there's just not many opportunities if you have
something brand-new to be able to train centers. And so there is some advantage, but I almost think the
bigger advantage is from having a reliable system.

Next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.

Rajbir Singh Denhoy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe I can start with Scott on the SG&A spending in the quarter. It was down almost, I guess, almost
$40 million from last year. I know you didn't purposely cut a lot of expenses in the quarter. And I'm
curious about whether we should think about this as kind of a sustained level of expense at this point. Are
there going to be changes in the way that you go-to-market now and given the access to hospitals? Will
there be any sort of permanent change to the expense level for you guys?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Probably nothing material. I mean, we're learning a lot about how to operate in this environment, but
we're expecting that the flow of operating expenses is probably going to start to increase again as our
sales increase.

Rajbir Singh Denhoy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe 1 for Mike. I'm just curious your thoughts on -- given that TAVR is in
such an elderly population, do you think there's going to be any protracted impact on patients' willingness
to go to the hospital, [indiscernible] longer to get to a more normalized level of demand for TAVR? Or do
you think will snap back relatively quickly?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. No, it's a good question. We've actually been wondering that. And we spend a lot of time with
people across the health care system that worry about how do you get patients to reengage and come
back to the hospitals. Hospitals have really worked on it, and they try and provide a safe place. They're
encouraging direct contact with the physician. But the one thing that we know about AS, it is a deadly
disease. It's just got a lousy future. And so those patients are highly incented to enter the system. And I
guess we're kind of learning like everybody else. We saw a rebound much faster in May and June than we
were expecting.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks. We're very excited about starting this EVOQUE trial in the tricuspid position. It really turns
out to be a great platform. It is a platform that can be used in mitral. We have decided that we were going
to advance M3 first, as the first platform for mitral regurgitation. We still like EVOQUE. And it may have a
role, but we're going to have EVOQUE lead in the tricuspid position and M3 lead in the mitral position.

they're quite happy and the procedure times are coming down. We are really focused on updating that
design. To be able to be one that is more easily used by many other clinicians and can lead to shorter

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on a good execution to you. Mike, I had one clinical and one financial, maybe on the clinical side.
I think I heard this correct, EVOQUE tricuspid, that's a transfemoral approach, correct? And does it imply
the SAPIEN M3 -- is that also a transfemoral approach? [ Do I need to have? ]

Michael A. Mussallem

So the second part of the question, if you can just -- can you just say it again, please, Vijay?

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

On the SAPIEN M3...

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes. So the M3 and EVOQUE systems are both transfemoral, right? So if that really gets at it, yes.
So we think that they are -- they have the opportunity here to be adopted, if we can demonstrate strong
evidence.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's wonderful. And let's say, transfemoral on the arterial, not the venous side, correct, Mike?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

So on the mitral side, you were going to be coming up the venous side, right? So the transfemoral for
MR is -- and so also -- so if you will, we come across the septum in the case of the mitral valve, whereas
become transfemoral for the tricuspid valve.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's helpful, Mike. That's great to hear, [ see that approach ]. Just one, Scott, quick one on the guidance
here. For CAGR at the high end, it implies mid-single digits for the back half. You guys said mid-singles
in first half, 3Q at the midpoint, the guide is for flattish. That would imply double-digit for Q4. Is that
something Q4, assuming we don't have a second wave, that's something that you guys are comfortable
with?

Well, like I said, we're not -- we're expecting there are going to be some ups and downs here in the third
and the fourth quarter. But with some kind of risk adjustment to factor in, little flare ups that may happen,
we do expect that the high end is probably the right way to pencil in TAVR for the full year, largely as a
result of the overperformance in the second quarter. Less as a result of our expectations for Q3 and Q4
having really changed much since April.

Philip Chickering

Back to Bob's question on China. I understand the ramp will be slow here. But can you guys size what the
market opportunity is for 3 to 5 years from now in China?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Pito. It's hard for us to know. And let me tell you why, and we're not trying to be evasive here.
We're going into a market where it's the individual pays, it's private pay. It comes out of their pocket.
And so our experiences in other places of the world are just not as applicable. We also are going into a
market where there's local competitors, and they were local first. So it's not clear to us how fast it's going
to develop and how big it's going to be. We think there is a lot of disease, and we think there are a lot of
people that will be interested in a first-class system to get their disease treated, but we're just not able to
size it yet.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. It's been a pretty challenging quarter for obvious reasons. But can you give us any
color on what your TAVR market share was in the second quarter versus the first quarter? And is the
performance from Ultra driving any market share gains?

Michael A. Mussallem

Yes. Thanks, Pito. During this difficult time, it's really tough for us to know what market share is. So just
know how fast the market grew is something we're just not comfortable to talk about. The data is lagging,

your jumping-off point.

Scott B. Ullem

the low teens in the second quarter. Is that where you were going?

So -- go ahead, Mike.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

No, we're just saying, no, we just -- we don't feel comfortable that the exit rate is a good proxy for the
rest of the year. Remember, probably some of the cases that we were doing in June were probably catch-
up from what was postponed in -- earlier in the quarter. And so probably not an ideal way to be able to do
modeling. We've tried to share with you our best estimate, and we've even included how we started the
third quarter and say, based on that, this is how we think Q3 is going to go, and we think it's likely to be
flat. But the exit rate, although interesting, is probably not the best measure.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question has to do a little bit with clinical trial enrollment. I
mean, could you just provide a little bit of color how people are beginning to reengage and bring patients
into the enrollment process?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Joanne. So what we were pleased with is we saw a willingness on the part of centers to get
back involved. And I think we shared a 50% number. So about 50% of the people in the class trials that
we said, hey, we're pausing, have already approached us and said, we're ready to go. Now from when
they're ready to go to when they're actually treating patients, takes some time. There's actually a much
smaller number of those centers that have actually treated patients. But they're coming back. So it's going
to cost us time, Joanne, clearly, on these clinical trials. It will -- yet to be seen, whether it's 2 quarters,
more or less, I don't know. But there clearly is some kind of a pause and it will be somewhat dependent
on the progression of COVID-19.

Mike, I wanted to turn back to the IP agreement settlement. And maybe you could just expand a little bit.
I'm just curious if you could expand a little bit on the implications. With the agreement in hand, maybe
talk to us a little bit about what you can do now that you felt uncomfortable tackling before? What does it
free you to do either clinically marketing, just help us appreciate next steps there? And just when I think
about over the few decades, honestly, and these kinds of agreements, it's often been a positive for the
company signing it because the bar is raised on competition, et cetera. So what are the implications, the
broader implications? It's nice to have it done. I get that part.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Rick. We're passionate about this whole area of being able to help these mitral and tricuspid
patients. When you're involved in a lawsuit, it just consumes a lot of energy. And not only consumes the
energy of the legal team, but it pulls much of the senior team into it, it pulls our field teams into it, it pulls
our R&D teams into it. And it's just a distraction. Instead of having people focused on how can I do great
things for patients? How do I advance this therapy? You're involved in some kind of a chess match. So
it's a real joy for us to say that, that time-consuming distraction is gone and we can focus on the exciting
innovations that help patients that are suffering from valve disease.

Frederick Allen Wise

And just last, briefly, I know this is not about next quarter, the second half, but just -- I'm always curious
to hear your latest thinking on new indications, TAVR indications. We've touched on bicuspid a little bit,
but anything incremental on asymptomatic or moderate AS to share?

Michael A. Mussallem

Yes. Thanks, Rick. Yes, those are -- those continue to be very important. You can imagine, things like early
TAVR, you get slowed down a little bit when you go through something like COVID, but we are -- continue
to be passionate about being able to treat asymptomatic patients, and we're optimistic about that. And we
also really want to get after these moderate patients. We continue to do a lot of thinking about that. We're
not ready with a clinical trial design because that will be a very important one. But that's one that's clearly
on our radar screen that we're going to continue to evaluate.
