THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to The AES Corporation Third Quarter 2021 Final Review. My name is Juan, and I will
be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to your host, Ahmed Pasha,
Global Treasurer, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin with. Ahmed, please go ahead.

Ahmed Pasha
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2021 financial review call. Our press
release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.

Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may
cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are discussed in our most recent 10-
K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.

Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with
the presentation.

Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Coughlin, our
Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.

With that, I will turn the call over to Andres. Andres?

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter financial review call.

Before discussing our progress since our last call, I want to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Steve
Coughlin. Steve has been with AES for 14 years and has served in a variety of roles, including as CEO of
Fluence and most recently as Head of both Strategy and Financial Planning.

I am happy to report that we are making excellent progress on our strategic and financial goals and
remain on track to deliver on our 7% to 9% annualized growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow
through 2025. We had a strong third quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.50, a 19% increase versus the same
quarter last year. We expect to deliver on our full year guidance, even with a $0.07 noncash impact from
an updated accounting interpretation related to the equity units of a convert we issued earlier this year.
Steve will provide more details shortly.

Today, I will discuss both the growth in our core business as well as the strategy and evolution of our
innovation business called AES Next. We see ourselves as the leading integrator of new technologies. The
2 parts of our portfolio are mutually beneficial to one another and enable us to deliver greater total returns
to our shareholders. More specifically, and as we have proven, our core business platforms provide the
optimal environment for exponentially growing technology start-ups. At the same time, our AES Next
businesses provide us with unique capabilities that enable us to offer customers the differentiated product
they seek to achieve their sustainability goals.

Turning to Slide 4. I will provide you with an update on our core business, including our growth in
renewables and an update on the overall macroeconomic environment.

Beginning with renewables. We continue to see great momentum in demand overall. As we speak, we
have senior members of our team, attending the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, meeting with
governments, organizations and potential customers. Since our last call in August, we have signed an
additional 1.1 gigawatts of renewable PPAs, bringing our year-to-date total to 4 gigawatts. Additionally, we
are in very advanced discussions for another 850 megawatts of wind, solar and energy storage. Based on

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

our current progress, we now expect to sign at least 5 gigawatts this year versus our prior expectations of
4 gigawatts. This represents the largest addition in our history and 66% more than in 2020.

With our pipeline of 38 gigawatts of potential projects, including 10 gigawatts that are ready to bid in the
U.S., we are well positioned to capitalize on this substantial opportunity. Our success is a result of our
strategy of working with our clients on long-term contracts that provides customized solutions for their
specific energy and sustainability goals. As such, almost 90% of our new business has been from bilateral
negotiated contracts with corporate customers. This allows us to compete on what we do best: providing
differentiated, innovative solutions.

One example of our work with major technology companies to provide competitively priced renewable
energy netted on an hour-by-hour basis. As we announced earlier this week, we signed a 15-year
agreement to provide around-the-clock renewable energy to power Microsoft's data centers in Virginia.
Year-to-date, we have signed almost 2 gigawatts of similarly structured contracts with a number of tech
companies, integrating a mix of renewable sources and energy storage.

Outside the U.S., we have a similar strategy of focusing on bilateral sales with corporate customers, which
has enabled us to sign long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts with investment-grade customers.
For example, in Brazil, we see demand for more than 25 gigawatts of renewables, providing a significant
opportunity to earn mid- to high-teen returns in U.S. dollars, while at the same time, diversifying our
Brazilian portfolio of mostly hydro generation. To that end, for the first time ever in Brazil, we are in
very advanced negotiations to design a 300-megawatt U.S. dollar-denominated contract with a large
multinational corporation for 15 years.

Turning to Slide 5. Our backlog of 9.2 gigawatts is the largest ever with 60% in the U.S. These projects
represent one of the main drivers for our growth through 2025 and beyond. With this pace of growth, we
are laser-focused on ensuring that we have adequate and reliable supply chain. For several years, we have
anticipated a boom in renewable development that could potentially lead to inadequate panel supply. And
as such, we took preemptive measures to ensure supply chain flexibility. Despite current challenges in the
market, we have non-Chinese panels secured for the majority of our backlog, which is expected to come
online through 2024. We have benefited from a number of strategic relationships with various suppliers
and a clear advantage stemming from our scale and visibility of our pipeline.

More generally, we continue to proactively manage potential macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation
and commodity prices. As part of our efforts to derisk our portfolio over the past decade, we have taken a
systematic approach to risk management. In fact, in places where we use fuel, it is mostly a pass-through
and, therefore, we have limited exposure to changes in commodity prices. Furthermore, more than 80% of
our adjusted pretax contribution is in U.S. dollars, insulating us from fluctuations in foreign currencies.

We not only remain committed to achieving our long-term adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow targets,
but we also continue to improve our credit metrics and are on track to achieve BBB ratings from all
agencies by 2025.

Now to Slide 6. We continue to benefit from a virtuous cycle with our corporate customers, in which our
ability to provide innovative solutions leads to more opportunities for collaboration and more projects.
For example, this quarter, we announced a partnership with Google to provide our utility customers cost
savings and energy efficiency features as well as opportunities to accelerate their own clean energy goals
through Nest thermostats.

Moving to Slide 7. Through AES Next, we integrate new technologies to bring innovation to the industry
and work with existing and new customers. AES Next operates as a separate unit within AES where we
develop and incubate new businesses, including a combination of strategic investments and internally
developed businesses, representing approximately $50 million of gross capital annually.

As I mentioned, the combination of AES Next and our core business creates the optimal environment
for growth, whereby we can better create solutions for customers by utilizing our industry insights
and operating platforms. One example of this mutually beneficial arrangement is in the combination of

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

renewables plus storage. We first combined solar and storage in 2018 in Hawaii. And today, nearly half of
our renewable PPAs have an energy storage component.

Another example is 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company that has patented technology, allowing
projects to be built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land while being resistant to hurricane force
winds. We see 5B's technology as a source of current and future competitive advantage for AES, allowing
us to build more projects in places where there is a land scarcity, constraints around height or soil
disruption or hurricane risk. Likewise, 5B benefits greatly from the ability to grow rapidly on our platform,
and we are currently developing projects in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Chile, Panama and India.

I am highlighting the AES Next portion of our business because it is increasingly clear that AES essentially
has 2 distinct business models that add value to our shareholders in very different ways. With our core
business, we continue to measure our success through growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow
as well as PPAs signed. With AES Next, these businesses contribute value creation through their extremely
rapid growth in valuation with the potential for future monetization. Nonetheless, they are a drag on AES'
earnings during their ramp-up phase.

In 2021, this drag on earnings is expected to be approximately $0.06 per share. We assume these losses
from AES Next in our 2021 guidance and our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate through 2025.

Turning to Slide 8. As you know, last week, Fluence, our energy storage joint venture with Siemens,
which began as a small business within AES, became a publicly listed company with a current valuation of
around $6 billion.

Similarly, early this year, another AES Next business, Uplight, received evaluation in a private transaction
of $1.5 billion. The value of our interest in these 2 businesses is now at least $2.5 billion or $3 per share
compared to the book value of our investments of approximately $150 million. In my view, this massive
shareholder value creation more than justifies the temporary negative impact to earnings.

In summary, our strategy of being the leading integrator of new technologies on our platform has yielded
great results, and we have several other innovations in development under AES Next. As they mature, we
will continue to take actions to accelerate their growth and show their value.

With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.

Stephen Coughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call
as CFO of AES. I have been at AES for 14 years and feel very fortunate to work at a company that is
transforming the electric sector so profoundly along so many talented people in finance and throughout
the company. With our strategic and financial progress to date, AES is well positioned to continue leading
this transformation.

In my previous role, I led corporate strategy and financial planning where we developed our plan to get
to greater than 50% renewables at least 50% of our business in the U.S. and to reduce our coal share to
less than 10% by 2025, all while growing the company 7% to 9%. We are committed to those goals, and I
look forward to continue executing toward them.

Before I dive into our financial performance, I want to discuss the adjustment to our accounting that we
made this quarter relating to the treatment of the $1 billion in equity units we issued in the first quarter
this year.

Our prior guidance assume that the underlying shares would not be included in our fully diluted share
count until 2024 upon settlement of the equity units. This approach was in line with industry practice and
supported by our interpretation of the accounting literature and our external auditors. However, we are
now subject to an updated interpretation of these instruments, and we are adjusting to include these
shares in our fully diluted EPS calculations. This adjustment results in an annual impact of roughly $0.07
this year and $0.09 in 2022 and 2023 using a full year of an additional 40 million shares.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

It's important to keep in mind that this adjustment has no cash impact and has absolutely no impact on
our business or longer-term growth rates as we had included the underlying shares in our projections for
2024 and beyond.

Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance
range, but we now expect to be at the low end of the range.

Now I'd like to cover 2 important topics: our performance during the third quarter and our capital
allocation plan.

Turning to Slide 11. You can see the strong performance of our portfolio in this quarter. Adjusted EPS
was $0.50 for the quarter versus $0.42 for the comparable quarter last year. This 19% increase was
primarily driven by improvements in our operating businesses, new renewables and parent interest
savings. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from South America, largely
due to unscheduled outages in Chile.

Third quarter results also reflect an approximate $0.03 quarter-to-date impact from the higher share
count due to the inclusion of 40 million additional weighted average shares relating to the equity units that
I just mentioned.

Turning to Slide 12. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $428 million for the quarter, an increase of
$97 million versus third quarter of 2020.

I'll cover our results by strategic business unit over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 13.

In the US and Utilities SBU, PTC increased $69 million as a result of our continued progress in growing
our U.S. footprint. The improvement was largely driven by higher contributions from Southland, which
benefited from higher contracted prices, new renewables coming online at AES Clean Energy and higher
availability at AES Puerto Rico.

In California, our 2.3 gigawatt Southland legacy portfolio demonstrated its critical importance by
continuing to meet the state's pressing energy needs and its transition to a more sustainable carbon-free
future. In fact, as you may have heard, last month, the State Water Resource Control Board unanimously
approved an extension of our 876-megawatt Redondo Beach facility for 2 years through 2023 to align with
our remaining legacy units. If the demand/supply situation remains tight, some of our legacy portfolio
could be available to meet California's energy needs beyond 2023 if state energy officials determine a
need, although we have not assumed this in our guidance.

As you can see on Slide 14, at our South America SBU, lower PTC was primarily driven by unscheduled
outages in Chile due to a blade defect impacting 6 turbines across our fleet that has now largely been
resolved. Our third quarter results were also driven by lower hydrology in Brazil.

Before moving to MCAC, I would like to provide an update on 531-megawatt Alto Maipo hydro project,
owned by a subsidiary of AES Andes in Chile. Construction continues to go well, and generation is
expected to begin in December of this year, with full commercial operation of the plant expected in the
first half of 2022, in line with our expectations. Alto Maipo is in discussions with its nonrecourse lenders
to restructure its debt to achieve a more sustainable and flexible capital structure for the long term. AES
Andes has honored its equity commitment to Alto Maipo and will not be assuming any additional equity
obligations. We expect the restructuring to be completed in 2022. And AES Andes already assumed 0 cash
flow from Alto Maipo, so we don't see the restructuring impacting our guidance.

Now turning back to our third quarter results on Slide 15. The higher PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily
reflects higher LNG sales in Dominican Republic and demand recovery in Panama.

And finally, in Eurasia, as shown on Slide 16, higher results reflect improved operating performance in
Bulgaria.

Now to Slide 17. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted
EPS of $1.07 versus $0.96 last year. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of our full year guidance, we are
incorporating the $0.07 per share noncash impact from the adjustment for the equity units issued earlier

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

this year. Prior to this adjustment, we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted EPS
guidance range, but we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range of $1.50 to $1.58. It's
important to note that this adjustment does not affect our longer-term growth expectations and has no
impact on our cash flow.

With 3 quarters of the year behind us, our year-to-go results will benefit from contributions from new
renewables, continued demand recovery across our markets, reduced interest expense and our cost
savings programs. These positive drivers are offset by the impact of the higher share count and the
dilution from AES Next, as Andres discussed earlier.

Now turning to our 2021 parent capital allocation on Slide 18. Beginning on the left hand of the slide and
consistent with our prior disclosure, we expect approximately $2 billion of discretionary cash this year. We
remain confident in our parent free cash flow target midpoint of $800 million and the $100 million from
the sale of Itabo, and we received the $1 billion of proceeds from the equity units issued in March.

Moving over to the right-hand side. The uses are largely unchanged from the last quarter with $450
million in returns to our shareholders this year, consisting of our common share dividend and the coupon
on the equity units.

We also continue to expect almost $1.5 billion of investment in our subsidiaries, with about 60% going
towards renewables globally. Our investment program continues to be heavily weighted to the U.S.
with approximately 70% targeted for our U.S. businesses. The increased focus on U.S. investments will
contribute to our goal of growing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to at least half of our base.

Finally, as I ramp up in my new role, I've had the chance to speak with many of our internal and external
stakeholders. It's clear that AES continues to successfully execute on our strategy, and we remain
resilient in the face of volatile macroeconomic conditions. Continuing to drive the successful execution
and delivering on our financial goals is my top priority. I look forward to getting input from more of our
investors and analysts and providing the information you need to understand the great future ahead for
AES.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres.

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Steve. In summary, we have had a strong third quarter, with both our core business and AES
Next doing well.

We are increasing our target for signed renewable PPAs from 4 gigawatts to 5 gigawatts, and Fluence
successfully completed its $6 billion IPO. We remain committed to delivering on our strategic and financial
goals, including our 7% to 9% annualized growth rate in earnings and cash flow, and we will continue to
create greater shareholder value by being the leading integrator of new technologies.
With that, I would like to open up the call to questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Sunderland from JPMorgan.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just want to start with the equity units change here. Will you look to offset any of the $0.09 impact to '22
or '23, just thinking about the incremental positives after the Analyst Day this year, such as the higher
renewable signings and the Redondo extension, kind of how do you see all of that shaking out with the
latest change here?

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Well, as you know, we have a -- we're a portfolio, and so we have pluses and minus. Overall, it's a
portfolio that has shown its great resilience over the last 2 years. So right now, we're not ready to give
guidance for next year. But we're committed to the 7% to 9% growth rates in earnings and in free cash
flow. So we'll be getting back to you on that.

But as you correctly point out, they are positives, and then we have the drag of the additional shares, and
we will be working with that. I'd say overall, we feel we're in an excellent position. We had a very strong
quarter and year-to-date.

One of the things I'd like to highlight is that we had a design malfunction in our steam turbines in Chile.
And this required them to undergo maintenance at 50,000 hours instead of 100,000 hours. And this
happened during the worst drought in Chile's history. So we were short energy when energy prices were
high. But nonetheless, if it weren't for the accounting, we would have been well within the mid or upper
region of our earnings. So this is the way that our portfolio works. So I don't know, Steve, do you want to
add something?

Stephen Coughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. No. Thanks, Andres, and thanks for the question. So look, as I said in my script, really, this is
just a recalculation. So it's just a different denominator on the capital -- on the equity units that we raised
earlier this year. So it's purely just math, frankly.

And looking ahead, we do see -- we have many levers, as Andres said, so we're fully committed to the
7% to 9%. These shares were already incorporated as of 2024. So it has no impact on that longer-term
growth rate.

And then looking ahead, we have a number of value-accretive opportunities in the portfolio. So we're in
the midst of our planning process at this point, and we'll give 2022 guidance in February. But we feel very
confident in the overall growth rate. And there's definitely things that we can do to stay within that range
going forward.

Richard Wallace Sunderland
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Understood. And then maybe just switching gears to the C&I side of the progress shown with the Microsoft
deal, curious if you could speak a little bit to the 2 gigawatts you cited and similarly structured solutions
signed year-to-date, how that compares to initial expectations. And then just kind of broadly, any near-
term limitations to your ability to further roll out this around-the-clock product, just how you think about
scalability there overall?

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

President, CEO & Director

Sure. I think we're rolling it out very well. We have said from the beginning when we did the first Google
one that this was a product that was -- there was a lot of interest from other large corporate customers.
So we feel good that this is not the last deal we'll do. I think the key here is really the ability to provide
around the clock. And so this is 100% renewable for 15 years. So the product keeps getting more
sophisticated.

Now to do that, you really need to be able to model all possible situations in a given area of service,
integrating also batteries and different forms of renewable power. So we've been very flexible on that.
We're very excited about that, and we see additional opportunities going forward.

I think as we mentioned, 90% of the deals we have signed in the last year-to-date have been with
corporate customers. And so we really see this type of structured project -- product really being a
competitive advantage for us. So stay tuned. We think there's something that we've been talking about,
and we're really seeing it come to fruition.

Operator

The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Steve, welcome and look forward to working with you. So a couple of questions from my end. First, just,
Andres, you made that comment that majority of the backlog through 2024 is now secured. Can I just ask
you to clarify, when you say that, that means wind, solar, storage, everything?

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

No, we were basically talking about solar panels, but we also have the balance of plant. So we feel very
secured about it. But the one that's been, let's say, more in the press and more top of mind for everybody
has been solar panels.

So we, very early on, started switching buying from Chinese panels to buying panels made in Malaysia,
Vietnam and in the future, Cambodia. And we've also, I think, been leaders in getting our suppliers
to certify that there is no, let's say, polysilicon coming from Western China in the -- that could be
questionable in terms of the labor practices.

So we feel very comfortable. We have these supplies. We have, let's say, flexibility, and we're also buying
a number of U.S. panels made in the U.S., so -- without polysilicon, by the way. So altogether, we feel
very comfortable that we have enough to meet our backlog through 2024, and that includes the balance of
the plant, and that includes batteries.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. I mean I guess in the last quarter, Andres, you mentioned something around maybe 90% of the
equipment needed for your then stated backlog of like, I think it was 8.5 gigawatts. Are you in that similar
percentage-wise for this updated 9.2-gigawatt number?

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Okay. Perfect. And then just obviously, great execution 5 gigawatts year-to-date. You have a target of 3
to 4 going to 5 up to 2025, right, like 5 gigawatts a year to 2025. So as you sort of have this momentum,
can you talk about sort of your margins, profitability, cash flow returns as you're seeing cost pressures?

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Great question. Look, we are achieving -- targeting and achieving low-teen returns in the U.S., and
we are targeting and achieving mid- to higher teens outside of the U.S. So those are the -- those are
really our hurdle rates that we are achieving. We feel very good about that.

Now I realize there's a lag between signing a PPA and commissioning the project. So this year, we'll
commission north of 1.5 gigawatts, maybe as high as 2. Next year, we should be somewhere between 3.5
and 4 gigawatts. And so this momentum will continue. So we see it's not just the number of megawatts,
we have to make sure that we're earning on average, the right returns.

Operator

Our next question comes from David Peters from Wolfe Research.

David Christian Peters
Wolfe Research, LLC

Back to the different accounting treatment for the equity units, you guys made the point to mention that
it was consistent with other peers, and the auditors had signed off. So I guess I'm just wondering what
specifically changed that you're now subject to this new interpretation.

Stephen Coughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. This is Steve. I'm kind of happy to describe in a little more detail. So we issued the 1 billion equity
units back in March. And as I said, it was -- the treatment that we used was very well vetted by our
accountants, by our internal auditors and external advisers. So at that point, we were using a treasury
stock method for the treatment, so it didn't show up in the share count.

So there's a number of companies that have used similar instruments. And in consultation with our
auditors, SEC have done a review of the treatment of these types of instruments and has informed our
auditors that they see a different interpretation. So although we haven't had direct communications with
the SEC, we felt it was most prudent that we go ahead and update the interpretation.

So we're really just taking a prudent course of action here. This conversion was already assumed in the
2024 share count. So it's just an interim impact to the calculation. There's no new transaction here. It's
just this recalculation of the shares. So ultimately, that's the source of it, and we're just trying to be as
prudent as we can in terms of the treatment.

David Christian Peters
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. I appreciate the detail there. Another question I had, just kind of switching gears, and I appreciate
the slide in the deck that you -- showing the value you've created for Fluence and Uplight. And I guess
now that the Fluence is public, would be a little bit more curious to hear about Uplight in terms of how
you think about the value of that company today versus when you got the value mark going forward,
particularly because I think I just saw that Uplight completed an acquisition recently.

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, we see Uplight in terms of its maturity 2 to 3 years behind Fluence,
but we're very happy with the progress that Uplight has made. And I'm very happy with what we've done
with AES Next because if you look at our capital contribution and today's valuation, that's a 20x. So that's
-- some of this has been in -- even though we were working, for example, on batteries for a long time, but

really, in terms of having a business, it's been roughly about 3 years, 3, 4 years. So these have created a
lot and a lot of value for our shareholders.

And it's very interesting because there are 2 sides of the business. The AES Next is really a value play,
especially during this rapid growth phase because you have to expense a lot of your investments really.
But at the same time, they're helping us grow. So when you talk about the structured products that we're
selling to corporations, having AES Next and the know-how from there has been extremely helpful.

So as I said, stay tuned, we have others in the works. The most mature probably is 5B. We think 5B has a
lot of potential because of what it offers. It offers speed of build. It offers less use of land, and hurricane
resistant is very important. Hurricane wind resistant is very important. So very happy with the progress
there and very happy about the relationship between the AES core business and AES Next.

David Christian Peters
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. And then just last one quickly, just a point of clarification. You said AES Next is roughly a $0.06
drag today. But as we get out to the outer years of your plan, I guess, '24 and '25, are you expecting it to
be contributing at that point? Or would it still be a drag?

Stephen Coughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. No, we are. So I mean, I think -- this is Steve. There's a near-term dilution around -- of a similar
level, say, for 2022 and then that gradually reduces. And so by 2024, '25, we're expecting positive
contributions and then significant acceleration in the positive contribution from that point.

Operator

The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congratulations on everything. Well done. Just to come back to this AES Next, again, kudos there. As you
guys think about the drag here, you talked about '21 having a $0.06 drag. Through the '25 period here,
how are you thinking about the cadence of that drag to evolve here? By the time you get to '25, what is
that reflected in your expectations here?

And then maybe I'll throw in another sort of nuanced EPS question. When you're thinking about the
converts here, obviously, you were able to offset that and be at the top end of '21. What does that say
about by the time you get to '25, considering that the converts admittedly would have been sort of
effectively fully diluted by then in terms of where you stand within your range as well, again, against the
backdrop of all your successes, be it origination or otherwise?

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Steve and I will answer this one. Let me take the second one. So definitely, it was in our '25
numbers because it was assumed that they would convert and so that was the share count. So what is
different is that we have a higher share count '21 and '22 and '23. That is the only difference in these
calculations.

Regarding AES Next, the one that's producing the largest drag is Fluence. Quite frankly, Fluence as it
matures and had -- it's made all these investments in new designs and gearing up to be able to meet that
supply in terms of guaranteeing supply of batteries around the world. And if sales increase, your -- this
will, I would say, gradually turn positive. So I think maybe, Steve, do you want to mention...

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Yes. No. I mean, obviously, as Andres said, I led Fluence for its first 2.5 years, so I'm very familiar with
the company and its trajectory.

And look, the opportunity for Fluence just gotten massive, more massive than even we predicted when
I started there. So going out and raising this capital was clearly targeted to go big and go much bigger.
And so this -- in some ways, what it does is it increases the near-term dilution deliberately because we're
investing to accelerate the scale of the company, and we know that it can be successful if we accelerate.
So -- but it's also been significantly increasing the upside when we get out into '24, '25 period.

So putting this capital to work is going to be near-term dilutive, but it's tremendously value accretive.
And we've already seen some recognition of that in where it is today, and we think it's only going to go
significantly upward from here. So in our numbers, it turns positive and it turned significantly positive by
2025.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

And that's significantly positive is reflected in that '25 number today? I just want to understand like how
much of the earnings are coming from that?

Stephen Coughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. So it is reflected, and I would say from the level of dilution today, it's going to flip flop to being at
least that level positive by that point.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

And when you say at least that level positive, that is AES NEXT in entirety, right? Not just Fluence.

Stephen Coughlin
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think Fluence will be, at that point -- Uplight will have grown too, but I would expect Fluence would
likely be the -- a few ahead, be the largest driver, but I would say at least $0.06 positive from Next by
2025.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Right. Okay. Got it. Excellent. And then if I can, just a more strategic question here also again against
your backdrop of '25 numbers. California extension, you've only reflected this new numbers through --
you haven't reflected this through '25. That seems like a further upside, whether it's Redondo or the
entirety of the legacy portfolio.

And then ultimately, just when you think about the portfolio altogether at this fossil transition, again,
kudos on transition, how are you thinking about some of the lingering assets, especially some of the
renewed interest across the marketplace to, for instance, LNG?

Stephen Coughlin
Executive VP & CFO

So I'll take the Southland question, and then we'll turn it over to Andres. But -- so that's correct, Julien,
the Southland extension is -- the Redondo extension provides some upside. So we had the Alamitos
Huntington base piece through 2023. We have the recent decision that's now upside for Redondo Beach.
But at this point, everything is just through 2023 and not beyond that. So to the extent there's an
opportunity beyond that, that would be upside to our guidance.

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

And in addition, this year, in the third quarter, we've seen in the numbers, we had the margin favorability
from the hedges there, those assets of legacy assets are quite valuable, and we see the potential for
further Q3 value recognition in our assets, which would also be upside into the guidance going forward.

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Julien, regarding sort of the LNG, we have a very strong position in the Gulf of Mexico between the
Dominican Republic and Panama. We have basically been contracting much more in terms of the
Dominican Republic, filling up the second tank and in Panama filling up the first tank. So we see LNG as a
necessary transition fuel. And I think what we're seeing a little bit in Europe and a little bit in China is that
it's very important to manage this transition.

So while we're coming up with new technologies, making it possible to put more renewables on the grid,
make renewables cheaper, make them more efficient and satisfy more what customers want, we see that
in some -- many places, LNG, natural gas is the necessary transition fuel. So it will work together. And as
we said, we are on our way to filling up our full capacity of the 2 locations of the 3 tanks.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. So it sounds like literally and perhaps figuratively, you haven't quite filled the tank on the
incremental contribution from LNG or California when it comes to '25 yet? There's more to go.

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Yes. That's right. That's right. There's still more potential. And quite frankly, that's the most profitable
thing we can do is to fill up an existing tank.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to just explore the Google Nest agreement and just talk a little bit more about the magnitude, if
you could, and sort of repeatability of that approach. It looks like a great solution where you can bring a
lot of your skills to bear to provide some value, but I'm struggling sort of thinking about how to sort of try
to assess the magnitude of the opportunity here.

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

Well, this is through Uplight, and Uplight has been, I believe, the biggest seller of Nest in the U.S. because
it reaches around 100 million final consumers in the U.S. So the idea is to continue to add on that platform
more things, improve customers' experience and customers' capabilities of improving their energy
efficiency use.

Now of course, Uplight works through large utilities. So that's really how it goes. So I think there is a lot
of opportunity there. I agree with that. And what Uplight has been doing is acquiring additional capabilities
by some of these acquisitions adding on to that platform. So it's really using that platform, using that
entry into final consumers to provide additional value-add services.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Understood. And is there a way to think about that value in terms of sort of the per customer value or
some other metric in terms of the benefit that utilities would receive from the kinds of services you could
provide here?

THE AES CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 04, 2021

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

I don't have that available right now. I think the way to think about it is this is the value of the total
Uplight platform. And as you know, we partnered with Schneider Electric to have more capabilities. We've
made more acquisitions, and we're working very closely with our utility customers. So I think the way this
value will be reflected and captured is through the value of Uplight. And as I said, I think it's 2 to 3 years
behind Fluence in terms of its evolution.

Stephen Calder Byrd
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Very clear. And then just last question for me, just on LNG. You've been making great progress.
You just described on Julien's question sort of you're moving towards kind of filling up a number of these
resources. I was thinking once they're essentially sort of filled to the capacity that you've targeted, they're
fairly mature assets at that point and there might be a more logical owner with a fairly low discount rate
at that point once they're mature. Are these good monetization assets when they're mature? Are there
reasons you kind of see further option value essentially around these assets longer term?

Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert
President, CEO & Director

I think 2 things. As you know, we are growing very rapidly in renewables. We have plans to sell down coal.
So we will continue to manage this portfolio to optimize its value for our shareholders. And so we'll see
how that develops. Right now, our focus is really on filling up the gas tanks.
