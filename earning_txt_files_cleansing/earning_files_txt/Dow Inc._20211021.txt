Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone. Welcome to Dow's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Also,
today's call is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Pankaj Gupta. Please go ahead, sir.

Pankaj Gupta
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning. Thank you for joining Dow's third quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast,
and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor
Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor
Relations Vice President. And joining me on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer.

Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides.
During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about
the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks
and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking
statements. Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties
which may cause such differences.

Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer
to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and
other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our
comments today and on the Dow website.

On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin by reviewing our third quarter highlights and
operating segment performance. Howard will share our modeling guidance and outlook, and then Jim will
recap our strategy for disciplined value growth that we outlined at our Investor Day earlier this month and
why Dow continues to be a compelling investment opportunity. Following that, we will take your questions.

Now let me turn the call to Jim.

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Pankaj, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

Starting on Slide 3. In the third quarter, Dow achieved top and bottom line growth both year-over-
year and sequentially. I'm incredibly proud of the Dow team for delivering these results and doing so
safely despite industry supply disruptions from hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our proactive storm
preparations enabled us to maintain the safety of our team and community and recover quickly.

We delivered a 53% sales increase year-over-year with double-digit gains in every segment, business
and region. We also recorded a 7% increase in sales over the prior quarter. We captured strong price
momentum, driven by tight supply-demand balances across our key value chains, and we achieved
volume growth of 2% both year-over-year and sequentially, supported by continued strong end-market
demand despite supply and logistics constraints.

We increased operating EBIT by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year with improvements in all segments
and businesses and $58 million higher sequentially. Key contributors included year-over-year margin
expansion of 1,170 basis points, driven by price momentum and demand growth, and increased equity
earnings, up $189 million, for margin expansion at our Sadara and Kuwait joint ventures.

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Our continued focus on cash generation and our balanced disciplined capital allocation enabled us to
deliver cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion, up $958 million year-over-year, driven by margin
expansion from price momentum in key value chains. We returned a total of $918 million to shareholders
through our industry-leading dividend of $518 million, plus $400 million in share repurchases. And we also
reduced gross debt by more than $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our proactive liability management actions
to tender existing notes have resulted in no long-term debt maturities due until 2026, and we've reduced
annual interest expense by more than $60 million.

Overall, Dow continues to deliver on its priorities, and we see further strength ahead as we benefit from
a favorable macro backdrop and execute our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our footprint and grow
earnings, driving significant value for all stakeholders.

Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating
EBIT was $2 billion compared to $647 million in the year ago period. Sequentially, operating EBIT was
down $60 million. Price gains in both businesses and in all regions led to margin improvement in the
core business and increased equity earnings. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT margins declined
by 300 basis points on higher feedstock and energy costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business
reported a net sales increase year-over-year, led by local price gains in industrial and consumer packaging
and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. Volumes declined year-over-year due to lower
polyethylene supply as a result of planned maintenance turnarounds and weather-related outages in the
quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered price and volume gains on strong demand
in industrial and consumer packaging applications, which were partly offset by hurricane-related outages.

Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT was $713 million, up
$609 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued tight supply and demand in both businesses.
Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $65 million and operating EBIT margins expanded by 50 basis points
on volume and price gains in both businesses.

The Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year ago
period, with price gains in all regions on tight supply-demand balances. Volume declines year-over-
year primarily reflected the planned transition of a low-margin coproducer contract as well as weather-
related outages and third-party supply constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered sales growth
due to increased local price and volume from additional supply availability to meet resilient demand.
The Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year ago period,
with local price gains in all regions. Volume increased year-over-year on strong demand for materials in
industrial manufacturing and energy applications. Net sales also increased sequentially, driven by volume
growth, primarily in coatings and industrial applications from increased supply and local price gains in all
regions.

And finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $284 million, up
$209 million versus the same quarter last year as margins increased 750 basis points due to strong price
momentum and robust demand recovery for silicones and industrial coatings offerings. Sequentially,
operating EBIT was up $59 million on price gains, leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points.

The Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year with price gains in all regions.
Volume increased over the prior year on stronger consumer demand for personal care, mobility and
electronics offerings. Sequentially, sales were down as price increases in all regions were more than offset
by volume declines as a result of planned maintenance and third-party supply and logistics constraints.

The Coatings & Performance Monomers business delivered increased net sales year-over-year as higher
raw material costs and tight supply/demand balances led to price gains in all regions. Volumes were
down year-over-year as demand recovery for industrial coatings was more than offset by weather-related
outages and third-party supply and logistics constraints. Sequentially, the business delivered local price
gains in all regions, supported by increased volume due to continued strong demand for acrylic monomers
and architectural coatings and increased supply availability.

Now let me turn it over to Howard to review the modeling guidance.

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Howard I. Ungerleider
President & CFO

Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we see a
continuation of robust demand growth across our packaging, infrastructure, consumer and mobility end
markets. Brand owner inventory levels remain low. And as a result, we anticipate higher seasonal demand
continuing into the holiday season this year.

In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we continue to see resilient demand for packaging applications and for
our differentiated functional polymers. Global polyethylene supply remains constrained as the industry
completes higher turnaround activity and supply chains recover from weather events on the U.S. Gulf
Coast. We exited the third quarter experiencing higher raw material and energy costs, which we anticipate
will likely persist through the fourth quarter. We expect these costs to be an approximately $350 million
headwind sequentially. Dow will continue to utilize our broad geographic footprint and best-in-class
feedstock flexibility to help mitigate these impacts.

We also anticipate a $175 million tailwind from turnarounds in the quarter as we completed our planned
maintenance at our cracker in Canada.

In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, continued consumer demand for furniture and bedding,
appliances, pharma and home care are expected to keep supply tight in our key value chains. Due to
the weather-related outages in the third quarter, some of our planned turnaround activity was moved
to the fourth quarter. Sadara will also start a turnaround at its isocyanate facility in the fourth quarter
as well. Altogether, we anticipate $100 million in this segment from turnaround impacts. Short-term
increased energy costs in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe are expected to be an additional $100 million
headwind in the quarter. We continue to see sequential recovery in industrial activity, particularly for
energy applications. We anticipate this recovery will continue at least through the fourth quarter as
industrial production continues to ramp up from very low inventory levels to meet demand.

In Performance Materials & Coatings, demand for electronics, mobility, building and construction
continues to outpace supply. Demand for architectural coatings is also expected to remain elevated due to
persistently low inventory levels across the value chain. Global production for silicones has been impacted
by the recent dual control policy enforcement actions in China, with silicon metal prices almost 3x their
previous highs. We intend to pull forward a scheduled turnaround at a siloxane facility in Zhangjiagang,
China to coincide with government actions to curtail power usage. Our current estimate for the quarter
includes $125 million from increased raw material costs and turnaround impacts. We'll continue to work on
mitigating the impacts of rising raw material costs through our integrated position in both businesses.

Despite higher raw material and energy costs in the fourth quarter, Dow will continue to leverage its
advantaged global footprint, structural cost and feedstock advantages as well as our broad suite of
differentiated products to meet growing demand.

On Slide 6, as we look ahead, we expect robust economic growth to continue. With the Delta variant
slowing the reopening of economies around the world, there remains significant pent-up demand globally,
particularly across our industrial and consumer end markets. Many industries continue to see elevated
order backlogs, coupled with low inventory levels, as supply chains struggled to keep up with robust
demand. These supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, which will certainly prolong the ability
to restock inventories across most value chains. As a result, we expect tighter-than-forecasted market
conditions to continue, a view strengthened by China's recent dual control policy that has impacted both
coal to olefins and methanol to olefins-based capacity, which represent more than 30% of China's total
polyethylene production.

2022 GDP growth forecasts are well above historical averages in most areas of the world as industries
ramp up to match the robust consumer demand with further upside as global chip shortages continue
to extend the recovery in manufacturing. Collectively, G7 countries have not yet fully recovered to pre-
pandemic GDP. This points to additional upside as economies return to more normalized consumption
levels with degree of vaccination increasing, particularly in Asia, where levels remain low relative to the
rest of the world.

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Moving to Slide 7. At our Investor Day earlier this month, we outlined how our differentiated portfolio
and our focus on sustainability-driven innovation will enable more than $3 billion in underlying EBITDA
improvement across the cycle. Our restructuring program and digital investments will yield $600 million
in increased EBITDA. Both are in progress, and our restructuring program is on track to achieve its $300
million run rate by year-end.

We also have a suite of higher return, lower risk and faster payback capital and operating investments
that will enable an additional $2 billion in EBITDA in the near term. And our investments to decarbonize
and grow at our Fort Saskatchewan site in Alberta, Canada are also expected to deliver approximately
$1 billion in increased EBITDA. And as we've already shared, we're executing against a favorable macro
backdrop that we expect will continue to support constructive market fundamentals for our key value
chains.

Turning to Slide 8. You'll see the detailed list of these low-risk growth investments. Our capital
investments are expected to generate $1 billion in EBITDA through incremental capacity expansions,
debottlenecking and enhanced feedstock flexibility across our operating segments. We're already making
good progress. For example, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion to
add ethylene capacity of 65,000 metric tons per year to support growing polyethylene demand is now
complete and will ramp by the end of the fourth quarter. Our FCDH pilot plant in Louisiana will start up in
2022, featuring 20% to 40% lower CapEx and 5% to 7% lower OpEx, while reducing CO2 emissions by up
to 20% compared to other PDH technologies.

In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our debottlenecking project to add 60,000 metric tons per
year of aniline will be fully online by year-end. And earlier this year, we signed an MOU for a new South
China hub to advance local supply and formulating capabilities to serve the fast-growing Asia Pacific
market.

In Performance Materials & Coatings, we recently completed a capacity expansion at one of our
silicone polymer plants. And by year-end, we will complete a new silicone sealant compounding unit to
enable sustainable solutions for high-performance building and infrastructure applications. And we are
progressing our 50 kt methacrylate investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast to support global end markets such
as inks, resins and packaging materials, which is scheduled to come online in the first half of next year.
In addition, our operating investments are also expected to generate another $1 billion in EBITDA as we
improve our production capabilities and shift our product mix to higher growth and higher value markets.
For example, in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, we're increasing capabilities and shifting our
mix toward higher-margin polyurethane systems for mobility and consumer applications. Our Industrial
Solutions business is increasing capabilities to supply differentiated materials into the textile market.

Our ECOFAST collaboration with Ralph Lauren lowers energy usage by 40% and water usage by 50% in
the fabric dying process. And by 2025, the brand aims to incorporate this technology in more than 80% of
its solid cotton products.

In Performance Materials & Coatings, we're expanding our ability to formulate differentiated silicones for
a number of attractive markets, including silicone adhesives for foldable displays in consumer electronics,
thermal conducted silicone solutions for electric vehicles and silicone solutions for 5G where the market is
expected to more than double over the next 10 years. And we recently partnered with customers on high-
value innovations like paper barrier coating applications that use our award-winning RHOBARR polyolefin
dispersion technology and Callaway's Supersoft golf balls, which feature a new hybrid cover made with
Dow's PARALOID-impact modifier.

In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we're enhancing our extensive conversion and testing capabilities
to commercialize resins through packaging design, speeding the innovation process and expanding
the addressable market for higher margin and more sustainable products. For example, we're already
benefiting from the 9-layer blown film extrusion line project completed this year. We're also making
investments to improve asset reliability, which will increase output and expand margins. And we're using
digital technology for customer trials and process automation to accelerate catalyst development for
new resins and processes like FCDH where we can typically be 100x more efficient than conventional
experimentation.

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Collectively, our slate of near-term investments will generate an increase of approximately $2 billion
in underlying EBITDA, and we intend to deliver this growth with a disciplined and balanced approach,
maintaining our top quartile performance in cash flow, cost structure, debt reduction and shareholder
remuneration.

With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 9. The strategy we outlined at our Investor Day builds on our long
history of industry leadership. Our plan enables us to capture demand from sustainability drivers, achieve
0 Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and deliver meaningful underlying earnings and cash flow growth for
years to come. Our path to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings is a phased site-by-site approach
that both retrofits and replaces end-of-life assets with low-carbon-emission facilities while also expanding
our capacity. This plan will deliver a 30% reduction in our CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2030 through
a disciplined approach that manages timing based on affordability, macro and regulatory drivers around
the world.

Our Texas-9 cracker proves that we can do this and do it well. Texas-9 is 60% lower carbon intensity
than any asset in our fleet, and that's without any specific design for carbon capture or hydrogen. The
project was delivered with 20% better capital efficiency and 12 months faster than any other crackers
built in that wave. Overall, the project has a 65% lower conversion cost, is running consistently at more
than 110% of nameplate capacity and has delivered greater than 15% return on invested capital since
start-up. We will leverage key learnings from Texas-9 as we plan to build the world's first-ever net zero
carbon emissions ethylene cracker and derivatives complex in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, delivering
approximately $1 billion in EBITDA, as Howard outlined earlier. This project will more than triple our
ethylene and downstream derivative capacity at the site while decarbonizing emissions for 20% of our
global ethylene capacity. We selected this site due to the availability of carbon capture, infrastructure,
advantaged feedstocks and supportive government policies and incentives.

On Slide 10, as we capture these attractive growth opportunities, we will maintain our balanced and
disciplined financial approach since spin. We are committed to keeping CapEx at or below D&A, well below
pre-spin levels, while targeting return on invested capital above 13% across the economic cycle. We
will continue to align our capital spend to the macroeconomic environment, our affordability and return
targets.

Our investments align to 3 categories: First, we'll maintain our foundation and maximize the return of our
existing assets while ensuring safe and reliable operations. Second, we'll execute our pipeline of faster
payback, lower-risk incremental growth projects for downstream and sustainability-driven applications
growing faster than GDP. And we'll invest approximately $1 billion per year to decarbonize our footprint
and grow earnings. These investments enable us to capture increasing demand for low carbon footprint
products while derisking the enterprise with lower emissions assets.

In closing, on Slide 11, Dow is well-positioned to deliver significant long-term value for shareholders.
We have actions in place to both decarbonize our footprint and grow the enterprise as we achieve an
additional $3 billion in underlying EBITDA, maintain industry-leading cash flow generation and drive
towards zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions. Our balanced capital allocation approach targets more than
13% return on invested capital, keeps CapEx within D&A and return 65% of net income to shareholders
across the economic cycle. All of this is underpinned by our industry-leading portfolio, cost position and
strong track record of innovation that enables us to deliver differentiated products and solutions for our
customers and a more sustainable world.

With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.

Hassan Ijaz Ahmed
Alembic Global Advisors

Jim, as I take a look at your guidance, sequentially, you seem to be guiding to a $500 million downtick
in EBITDA. So $3.6 billion comes down to $3.1 billion. But just reading through the guidance, you don't
break out the impact of Ida. So is it fair to assume that you guys are guiding to sort of north of $3.1
billion in EBITDA for Q4?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Hassan. That's a great question. The impact -- the total impact of Ida was about $100 million and
split third quarter, fourth quarter. So that's how you should look at that. Most of the rest of the guide was
just impact on feedstock cost or raw material costs that we expect to see going into the fourth quarter.

Having said that, I think demand is going to continue to be strong. And I expect our operating rates will
be stronger than they were in the third quarter because of the impact of Ida. And I don't expect that we're
going to have a chance to build much inventory, but our intent is to run hard through the end of the year
because our customers need the demand, and we need to get out in front of this a little bit.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe just a little more color within the Packaging & Specialty Plastics sales guidance and, in particular,
what you're expecting for volume sequentially. And then, is there any sort of impact on the top line
from feedstocks or hydrocarbons? You can obviously tell I'm trying to back out your polyethylene price
assumptions.

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Vince, I expect the volumes will be better. We had St. Charles obviously out in the month of September,
and it came back here earlier in October. So I expect fourth quarter will have a strong run. And remember,
we had the turnaround in the fourth that was happening in the third quarter as well, and we're out of that.
So the 4, we'll be back. We'll see some additional ethylene out of the port because the back half of that
expansion started up. And I think you'll see higher volumes for the year. We're looking at volume increases
for plastics like 8%, 9% for the industry. I think for fourth quarter -- we managed 2% in the quarter, in
third quarter. I think for fourth quarter it will be higher than that. I do expect prices will moderate at some
point. I don't know exactly when that's going to be because, right now, inventories are low. But I don't
think it's going to fall as precipitously as some of the forecast estimate.

Operator

Next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes. Jim and Howard, can you talk about siloxanes and downstream silicone demand? What's happening
in siloxane merchant market? And how is this chain impacted by raw materials? I think, Jim, you said

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

silicone costs came up in China, so you shut down some -- shut down a plant. Can you expand on that?
And finally, what happens to the new siloxane capacity that was announced in China with these recent
dual control policies?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Yes. P.J., good question. I'm going to walk through several things. I would say, in the near-term, the
impact on silicon metal has been in China due to the restrictions from dual control. And as you know,
that was driven by the higher coal prices really pushing up the cost for the electricity producers. And the
electricity producers are capped on their electricity prices.

So some of them didn't run, and that forced the industry curtailment. Typically, as you're going into cold
weather months, industry takes the hit versus homeowners and consumers. You try to keep your people
warm. And so that hit silicon metals. For that reason, things became tight.

We've moved some silicon metals from Brazil over to China to offset that, and we'll run through the fourth
quarter, but we decided to pull a turnaround in Zhangjiagang into the fourth quarter. We had originally
planned it for first quarter. We decided to do it now. That takes a little pressure off the dual control
situation. That turnaround will cost us, I think, on Slide 5, it's in there, $75 million in the fourth quarter.
I expect we're going to see about $50 million higher cost, but both downstream G3 silicones demand and
siloxanes demand are very strong. And siloxanes prices have gone up significantly. And so I think we're
going to be in that situation for all of the fourth quarter, and I would expect into the first quarter as well.

Operator

Next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I have a 2-part question. The first part has to do with your expansion in Alberta in the late decade. That
seems to be your so large ethylene polyethylene expansion. And by my calculation, what that means is
that over the next 10 years or so, your capacity will expand 1% to 2% per year. And presumably, the
industry grows faster than that. And so is this approach an example of your disciplined capital approach
where you really only want to have high-return projects and what you'll do is you'll sacrifice volume
growth in service of that higher return?

Second part is for Howard. The net debt to EBITDA, you say, will go to 2 to 2.5x. That makes a difference.
Because if your EBITDA is $10 billion, that's a $5 billion difference. So is it 2 or 2.5? And are you going to
get there quickly? Or are you going to dawdle? Because if what you're going to do is lever up by another, I
don't know, $9 billion or $10 billion to buy back stock or increase dividends, how quickly are you going to
get there? Is it 2022 or '25 or somewhere in between?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Jeff, the first part of the Alberta expansion comes on in 2007. That brings on most of the new cracker
capacity. The cracker will be expandable, and it also brings on the derivatives. And then we retrofit the
existing cracker so we can tie the back end into the autothermal reformer, and that will come on in
2009. So that will be the largest mega project that we do. We do have investments in the near-term
on debottlenecking existing assets that will help us between now and 2007. And we have the ethylene
capacity to add some downstream capacity as well. So it will be a little bit more than 1% to 2% growth.
But our focus on Alberta is obviously to take advantage of the situation there to decarbonize and have a
good carbon capture location and take that whole site to net zero. Howard, do you want to get the net
debt to EBITDA?

11

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Yes, sure. Jeff, your point about disciplined balance on the capital allocation side, it goes to the debt as
well. I mean, when you think about what we did in the third quarter, it was very balanced. It was more
than $500 million in dividends. It was doing another $400 million of stock buyback, and then we took out
$1.1 billion of debt.

To your point on the 2 to 2.5 ratio, I would say some of our peers have a 1% swing between the low and
the high, so we're already giving you a better-than-peer view with saying our range is only half a turn.
But if you'd like me to narrow that further, I would say, use the midpoint. So our long-term average is 2 to
2.5. I would say, through the economic cycle, if you want to use 2.25, that's a reasonable proxy for where
we want to be, but we have the corridor there to recognize that it's a long-term target. Punctually today,
using the rating agency methodology through the end of the third quarter, we're probably around 2.4, 2.5.
So we have about 0.25 turn left to go to hit that midpoint of the 2 to 2.5.

Next question will come from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.

Michael Dwayne Harris
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

This is Mike actually sitting in for Bob. Just wondering, you guys made a couple of comments about
inventory still being tight. And I guess, from a polyethylene perspective, could you perhaps maybe
quantify what you're seeing in terms of days of inventory and how perhaps that may compare to what you
will consider more normal?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Yes, industry -- Mike, industry inventory and DDI fell. Industry inventory in September fell about 120
million pounds. And so days in inventory had dropped. Demand is obviously strong. And export demand
exceeded domestic and export exceeded the production. Obviously, storms had an impact on that as well.
We saw inventory declines in high density and linear low and a little bit of inventory build in low density,
but it isn't a significant number.

So when you look at the 5-year trends, and I think what we put in the slide deck to show you earlier, is
that the order backlog is up about 30% above normal and the inventory-to-sales ratio was down about
10%. I think that's going to stay in that band for most of the fourth quarter. And as the capacity comes
back from the hurricanes, we have still supply and logistics issues, so there are bottlenecks everywhere,
especially when it relates to marine pack cargo or export and as it relates to product being shipped by
truck. It's a little hand-to-hand combat right now. And if a truck driver doesn't show up, shipment gets
delayed. So I think we're going to be in that situation for the rest of the year and into the first quarter.

Howard I. Ungerleider
President & CFO

Just giving you some down numbers. Our DSI was down 7 days in the third quarter versus a year ago, and
our overall cash conversion cycle was better by 1 day sequentially. So we're tightly managing our working
capital.

Operator

Next, we'll go to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Jim, the consultants have a pretty sharp decline in ethylene chain margins through February. Do you agree
with that? Or are they being a little too bearish given the tightness right now in the marketplace?

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

David, I think a little bit bearish, the way I would categorize it. I think they are underestimating the
demand that's going to be there because there still is a significant inventory restock and continued strong
demand that we see coming. And I think they're overestimating how much supply is coming in. And if I
go back to the China situation, remember that about half of the CTO, MTO capacity is out of the money
right now. 60% of all the new capacity coming on in the world is in Northeast Asia, which will still be a net
importer for a long time. And it's all naphtha or higher cost base. And so, I think those things are going to
soften this. I do expect prices to moderate a bit. But I think we could see a pretty strong 2022 with higher
volumes, yet slightly lower prices.

Operating rates were always going to be in the high 80s to low 90s for the full year, so I don't see a
change there. And remember that the U.S. structural advantage, the Canadian structural advantage, our
position in Argentina and our positions in the Middle East are still going to remain strong.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.

Frank Joseph Mitsch
Fermium Research, LLC

Nice results. You did sequentially pick up your buybacks here to that $400 million level in the third quarter.
How should investors think about the pace of buybacks in 4Q and 2022?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Howard, do you want to take that?

Howard I. Ungerleider
President & CFO

Yes. Thanks. Frank, so the guidance we gave for the fourth quarter is 745 million shares outstanding.
So if you look at where we ended the third quarter or the average for the third quarter, that's about a 5
million share reduction, which would equate to another $400 million plus or minus of stock buybacks, so
essentially keeping pace with the third quarter.

With that said, look, we continue to be disciplined and balanced in the capital allocation, and we will
continue to be opportunistic. We're staying true to our 65% of our net income going back to shareholders.
Long term, 45% of the earnings growth will -- and the net income will go in the form of dividends, and
then we'll use stock buyback to top that up to 65%.

Operator

All right. Next question, we'll go to John Roberts with UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

We see all the containerships out in the harbors and all the containers stacked up on the docks and the
warehouses are full with drivers waiting to take product to the final customers. Your earlier comment was
about polyethylene producer inventories. Do you worry about contained product downstream? Or it would
seem like there's a lot of inventory in the channel downstream of the converters.

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Yes, it's -- the visibility is hard to track right now. I do think that some of the moves that the government
made recently to get the big ports 24/7 operation is going to help the backlog. What happens is typically,
when those ports get backlog, it spills over into other ports. We don't use Long Beach as much, but when
traffic spills over into the other ports, it hits us.

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

I would say that almost every value chain has some impact from that. And where we see the biggest
impact is being able -- it's kind of blocking material getting out. And so we're starting to see some
congestion and some competing demand. Product coming in. Sometimes it's faster to reload an empty
container to get it back to China. And so that competes with other materials going out. We don't see that
in every port, but certainly, on the West Coast, we're seeing that right now. I would say almost every
value chain we have, every application we have is short product. And I don't think there's enough material
tied up in all of that floating inventory or in the warehouses that, that is going to alleviate the demand
or fill the demand that's out there right now. I still think the consumer is strong, and we've still got other
economies that are coming back from COVID that are going to add to that demand.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Nice quarter. Just curious, when you think about '22, and you tend to have that nice little market
fundamentals for your 3 base segments, just curious any -- I know you think demand is strong. Any
thoughts on natural gas pricing, feedstock costs? Oil is going up. Just curious how you're baking in those
type of inflation numbers in that outlook.

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So we're starting to see some improvement in production, drilling and completion of wells. We're
going to bring more NGLs as we move out of the winter season. I believe what we're seeing short term
here is a knock-on effect as coal really ratcheted much higher in China. The first fuel that you go to that
could replace coal in the fuel grid is natural gas. And then LNG obviously went right up after coal. And
then the next fuel is oil, and oil came right up. And so that took us up to $80 a barrel.

I think we're going to see things will stabilize a little bit. As we go into winter, inventories are a little light
of the 5-year average going into winter. But you've seen prices unwind a little bit in the forward market by
about $1 a million BTU because weather plays a significant factor. So if we've a warmer fall, that's going to
take a little bit of sting out of the natural gas prices.

Even with that, the oil-to-gas ratio, but more importantly, the oil-to-gas spreads are good. And so I think
that's going to continue. And if we get through winter without a really, really cold snap, then I think
you're going to see prices to moderate. Long term or medium term, I would say, $2.50 to $4.50 for U.S.
production. And long term, about $2.75 a million BTU for natural gas.

Operator

And your next question will come from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.

Michael James Leithead
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is Mike Leithead on for Duffy. Maybe 2-part question for Howard. I guess one, just a clarification on
Jeff's earlier question. Is that 2 to 2.5 debt target a gross debt-to-EBITDA metric? Net debt? Because if I
heard your response correctly, it sounds like you still want to pay down slightly more debt from here.

And second, if we stay in this, call it, $6 billion or so annualized operating cash flow range from the past,
say, 24 months or so, we roughly know what CapEx will be next year. And it seems like there should still
be a decent amount of excess cash. I know you stressed a balanced approach. But just how should we
think about the priority of that excess cash? I guess that's the gold bar on your chart, but are buybacks
the flywheel here?

Howard I. Ungerleider

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Yes. The -- on the 2 to 2.5 debt-to-EBITDA ratio, that's a rating agency adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA
target. So that's over a long term. Typically, the rating agencies will look at 2 years back, current year
and then come up with a forward 2-year forecast. So when we think about that 2 to 2.5 range or as I
target the midpoint, in answering to Jeff's questions, of 2.25, that's over a 5- to a 10-year period. So as I
mentioned to Jeff, we're slightly -- we're at the higher end of that range today. So you will -- you should
expect over the next several years we'll continue to titrate that number down to the midpoint to 2.25. And
depending on how things go, we might go to the lower end of that range, we'll see.

In terms of the capital allocation priorities, it is -- we intend to continue what you've seen from us, which
is disciplined and balanced approach. The #1 priority for us is to safely and reliably operate our plants.
And then the next is organic investment. So where we have low-risk, high-return, fast-payback projects
that helps us continue to get the through-the-cycle average return on capital of the enterprise to 13%
or more, we will do that. Dividends would be next. So as the net income increases, that dividend should
increase in line with the 45% of net income over the cycle. And then share repurchases. And we -- like I
said earlier, we'll use share purchases to at least cover dilution, but then we will also be opportunistic and
compare opportunistic share buyback to any other use of cash. And over the long run, our goal is to do
the value-maximizing thing.

Operator

Next, we'll go to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

Bhavesh Mahesh Lodaya
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

This is Bhavesh for John. A question on your equity earnings from the JVs. It looks like each of your II&I
and P&SP segments is on track to deliver around $0.5 billion of earnings. Now quite a few unique regional
dynamics and feedstock arrangements are at play here. But broadly, could you discuss where these
businesses are in the cycle and perhaps any color on where you see the earnings of these businesses for
the next year?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Good question. On II&I and polyurethanes, I do believe that the demand and the operating rates for
isocyanates will continue to stay strong into next year, maybe a little bit lower operating rates on polyols,
but the key demand drivers and value drivers are going to be those systems and solutions that are going
into things like mobility, like construction, like appliances and, some extent, furniture and bedding and
things that are driven by consumer growth. And that will continue to remain strong.

The only thing that we've got coming that would be a detractor from those earnings would be we've got
a turnaround in this quarter on isocyanates in Sadara, but that's been planned. And they'll manage that.
They've been running very well. I expect to see them in good shape next year. And as you know, their
fixed costs are quite low. And so I think they'll be a very good source for us to fulfill that demand.

Howard I. Ungerleider
President & CFO

Just one point on maybe on the cash flow side, on the equity earnings, if you recall that our dividends
usually come from the prior year earnings. So with this year's equity earnings up, as you pointed out, then
that will drive a cash flow tailwind for us next year, probably in the range of at least $200 million to $300
million as we sit here today, possibly more.

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

Two questions. In the period with sort of the tighter supply constraints, have you seen a mix be a net
positive or negative across the portfolio? In other words, how do you see things playing out when the
supply constraints ease?

And secondly, with respect to decarbonization, so long as you could see a path to hitting your return on
capital hurdles, how broadly would you consider vertically integrating in decarbonization platforms?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

On the mix, I think any time you get a tight situation like this, there's a natural gravitation for the mix
to move up. I would also say, though, that we've been trying -- customers are in close communication.
And we're trying, obviously, to keep everybody running. There's a lot of juggling going on. There are some
specialty grades where it's hard to shift the mix up because things are so tight right now, especially in
some of our elastomeric products.

On decarbonization, I think it's just going to depend on the situation in the geographies that we're
looking at the investments. In Canada, we don't need to do the back investment into CO2 capture and
sequestration. And I think there are a lot of players that are out there that have capabilities to do that. So
if we can keep our investments focused on assets that generate revenue for us and generate growth for us
and are zero carbon emitting, I think there's plenty of room for third parties and others to play to help us
to handle the CO2.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Alex Yefremov with KeyBanc.

Aleksey V. Yefremov
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I have a question about Slide 8, where you detail in-flight investments for $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion
EBITDA contribution. In my math, this implies fairly high, high single-digit growth versus your base
EBITDA. So can you at a high level explain why investors can have confidence in this target? What are you
doing differently from sort of traditional Dow's growth rate here? So anything that can sort of at a high
level explain why this growth is achievable?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll start, and I'll ask Howard to fill in a little bit, but I'm going to start with silicones because that's
an area that grows at 2x GDP. And if you look at mobility and if you look at electronics and if you look
at consumer applications, they're going to continue to grow as well as we've got expansions coming
for silicones products into construction sealants for glass glazing for big skyscraper buildings. So that is
high GDP growth, and that's going to continue. In Industrial Solutions, not only highest-value return to
ethylene, but also high-value downstream growth, driven primarily by consumer applications. To some
extent, oil and gas, which we see recovering. I know we have many, many cases where our oil and gas
products help people reduce CO2 emissions in the midstream production.

And then things like ECOFAST Pure, which is a partnership with Ralph Lauren, where we just open sourced
that technology to use that product, which would get textile mills that use cotton to switch over to a
product that is -- uses 90% less chemicals, 50% less water, 50% less energy. I think that's a huge driving
force towards more sustainability in an area that's a tough environmental aspect.

And then, if you go to PM&C, we've got continued growth in our downstream systems, which have been
growing at greater than 11% per year for a long time. We'll continue those investments. We've got high
growth targets for our downstream coatings business to continue to keep up with the demand, specifically
traffic demand. Howard mentioned paper demand for paper cups replacing others with our RHOBARR
dispersions and also architectural demand, which is our growth leader in that space. And then you get
back to Packaging & Specialty Plastics, which is continuing to grow above GDP, about 1.4x GDP in our
forward forecast.

DOW INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2021

It's very dispersed. So when we talk about $3 billion of EBITDA growth over that time period, it's pretty
evenly split between all 3 segments, and you're going to see about $200 million to $300 million of it come
on next year, and that is projects that are already completed and will be finished by the end of the year.

Operator

All right. Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats on a strong quarter. So I just wanted to get back to the polyethylene discussion. I guess we're
hearing some conflicting things because we saw an ACC number on inventories of mid-40s on days of
supply, maybe 47. And then, it appears that the September, October increase on polyethylene has stalled
as well. So is that -- are those correct characterizations? Or would you say that the market is really tight
and you do expect further increases as we go through the year?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

I think mid-40s number on days of inventory is kind of an average number. But remember, sometimes the
inventory numbers are things that are locked up and can't get shipped out. And so I think that's the main
delta in some of the data that I shared with you. I would say, demand and production, I think, are both
going to be strong in the fourth quarter. I also think some of the shipment delays are going to moderate
as we get through the quarter. And I think that will help. But 40 to 45 days of inventory is not much
inventory for the polyethylene business.

Operator

Your next question will be from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho.

Kieran Christopher De Brun
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

This is Kieran on for Chris. I was just wondering if you can touch a little bit between II&I and PM&C, you
mentioned third-party supply constraints. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of those
third-party supply constraints and whether you see them easing into the fourth quarter into the first half
of next year? If it's something that you continue to expect to persist throughout 2022?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

They are primarily -- the third-party supply constraints were primarily industrial gas suppliers. They
were wrecked pretty hard earlier in the year from the Texas freeze, and then they got hit again from the
hurricanes in Louisiana. It is improving. I expect it will continue to improve through the quarter. And I
think they're working hard. I know they're working hard to work on reliability and get the assets back up.
And we're working hard as well to make sure that we've got redundancy in those supplies. So we'll take
actions like we do after events like this and make sure that we've got redundancy in the supply as well,
but that was the primary impact.

Operator

All right. Next, we'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.

Matthew Porter DeYoe
BofA Securities, Research Division

It's Matt DeYoe on for Steve. Just a question on polyurethanes. I think you touched a little bit on this, but
where do you think we are in the cycle? Because even earlier this year, we had some of your peers talking
about over-earning. I know we've had a lot of outages, but demand is still really strong. Inventories are
light. So how does this shake out into 2022?

And then as you push downstream into systems, what do you expect the margin uplift to be? And how is
the business maybe different from like an SG&A intensity perspective?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

I think supply/demand balances are pretty favorable through 2026 because durables demand has been
outpacing the supply growth and durables pull a lot on MDI and TDI operating rates. And so, I think you're
going to see an earnings ridge in the business that we haven't seen. They've also been a fair number of
delays or rationalizations of capacity. And we've also seen, obviously, margin uplift in that segment for
polyurethane systems.

Operator

All right. And we'll take our final question from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.

Matthew Robert Lovseth Blair
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division

Howard, I think you highlighted the feedstock flexibility in your crackers. Just given the volatile energy
markets, do you have any specific examples of the kind of changes you've been making? For example, are
you switching away from propane either in the U.S. or in Europe?

And then also, if you have any thoughts on the recent widening of the ethane-to-natural gas spread. I
think it's up to about $0.08 a gallon. Do you see that as kind of a short-term blip or perhaps something
that may be a little bit more medium term?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

No. Go ahead, Howard.

Howard I. Ungerleider
President & CFO

Jim is looking at me, so I will take that. Look, I would just say this. Our feedstock flexibility is really a key
enabler of our consistent outperformance versus our peers, as you've seen in the last several years of our
annual benchmarking. It includes what I would say is unmatched feedstock flexibility for most of our fleet.
So we've got the ability to max ethane on the U.S. Gulf Coast. We also have propane. We can do minimum
naphtha, if we need to in Europe. We also have the ability to do max LPG. To your point, I mean, propane
is not necessarily in the slate right now, so you're not doing that in Europe. But then you also look at the
point that Jim made earlier, which is we've got our Canadian advantage. We've got the feedstock flexibility
in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We've got the Argentinian advantage, and we also have the Middle East.

And I also think when you talk -- a lot of people talk about feedstock flexibility, but most of the time, what
that means is they have 3 furnaces that can crack this feed, 2 furnaces that can crack this feed. When we
talk feedstock flexibility, it's in furnace flexibility. So we have the ability to switch within the furnace, and
we can do it -- frankly, we can do it day by day. Typically, we do it every week. Do you have anything to
add?

James R. Fitterling
Chairman & CEO

I would only add 2 things. It isn't always a linear equation when you switch from cracking ethane to
propane. At these propane prices, some might expect that propane was out of the crack slate. And
actually, we've been cracking a fair amount of propane because we're generating a lot more byproducts
out of that, and we need them all. And so it has been in the slate more than you might expect. And I think
as the natural gas prices moderate going into the year, we're going to see that the ethane and propane
advantage in the U.S. Gulf Coast is going to be there.
