Presentation

Operator

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the STERIS Plc Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions]

Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to
Julie Winter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.

Julie Winter
Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications

Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, we have Walt Rosebrough, our President
and CEO; Mike Tokich, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dan Carestio, our Chief Operating Officer.

I do have a few words of caution before we open for comments from management. This webcast
contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. Any redistribution, retransmission

decision-making.

With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning
to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic
revenue increased 2%, driven by 100 basis points of volume and 100 basis points of price. Constant
currency organic revenue for the quarter includes a total of about $5 million from prior year tuck-in
acquisitions, primarily in Healthcare spread across capital equipment, consumables and service.

Gross margin for the quarter was up 140 basis points to 45% and benefited from mix, price and
productivity. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.5% of revenue, an increase of 220 basis points from
the second quarter last year due to higher gross margin attainment and lower operating expenses mainly
for travel, sales and marketing and compensation due in part from business disruption from COVID-19.
The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.1% and includes the benefit of stock compensation offset
by unfavorable discrete item adjustments. Net income in the quarter grew 13% to $127.3 million and
earnings increased to $1.48 per diluted share as compared to $1.32 per diluted share in the prior year.

Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Considering our cash position of
$312 million, access to available credit lines and a low leverage ratio, we are well positioned from a
liquidity standpoint. Even reflecting the anticipated additional leverage for the Key Surgical acquisition, our
debt levels remained solidly in our comfort zone. During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled

$43.9 million, while depreciation and amortization was $54.4 million. Free cash flow for the first half was
$185.6 million, an increase of $23.6 million over the first half of last year, primarily due to improvements
in net income and working capital somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Mike, and good morning, all. I hope you all have voted or will later today. We are pleased to be
with you to report such encouraging results for our second quarter, which reflect the resilience of our
business and the good work done by STERIS associates.

In total, constant currency organic revenue grew 2% year-over-year and improved substantially on a
sequential basis. We benefited from the continued recovery in procedure volumes during the quarter as
well as continued strength in segments with exposure to COVID-19-related products and services.

Our release walks through the details, but I will touch on a few highlights of the quarter. Life Sciences
grew 16% in the second quarter, continuing its strong performance, in particular, for consumables. While
it's difficult to dissect the 31% consumables growth in the quarter, we believe the underlying growth rate
remained in the lower teens and the balance of the growth is due to COVID-19 pre-buying in anticipation
of vaccine production demand. As we've said all year, we do not anticipate maintaining these growth
percentage levels in perpetuity. In particular, our fourth quarter has difficult comparisons as last year's
fourth quarter was the beginning of the Life Science consumables significant COVID-19-related revenue
uptick.

Rebounding from first quarter levels, our AST segment grew 9% year-over-year in the quarter, benefiting
from continued demand for COVID-19 product sterilization as well as a significant recovery of procedure-
related medical device sterilization volumes. As we've said in prior quarters, we continue to invest
aggressively in capacity expansions at AST, reflecting our long-term expectations for the growth in this
business.

As anticipated, our Healthcare segment continued to be impacted by some disruption in procedures in the
quarter, declining 3% year-over-year but improving nicely on a sequential basis. Both consumables and
service rebounded from first quarter levels, with consumables revenue growing 6% year-over-year while
service revenue was flat.

Capital equipment shipments in the segment declined as we anticipated. Those shipments were down
14% versus the second quarter of last year. As you know, we break our capital business into either large
projects or replacements. We were pleasantly surprised to see replacement orders rebounding sequentially
in the quarter, reflecting a return to more normal procedure volumes. Capital equipment orders have
grown sequentially through October from the low point in May and have returned to about last year's
levels. Like most in our space, while we are pleased to see the sequential improvements in revenue from
procedures to date, there is significant uncertainty in the coming months, as the COVID-19 pandemic
appears to be escalating in many areas around the world.

We have seen recent procedure declines in parts of Europe. It is too soon to tell what we will experience
going forward in Europe and in the U.S. in the next 6 months. That said, we are not planning a significant
disruption of procedure volumes in the second half of our year. As a result, we are planning for sequential
revenue growth in the second half to result in about flat year-over-year revenue, excluding any impact
from the anticipated Key Surgical acquisition. While we are quite pleased with recent trends, the situation
is fluid and difficult to predict. We still consider our Healthcare capital equipment portfolio to have the
greatest downside risk in the near term. If procedures continue to improve and the pandemic subsides, we
will expect some costs in our operation to start coming back to more normal levels in the second half of
the year, which will limit our bottom line percentage growth somewhat.

As we said all along, we manage this business for the long haul. Our actions during this pandemic reflect
that approach, including our decision to avoid unpaid layoffs or furloughs related to COVID-19. We've
worked hard to maintain jobs and compensation for our people, putting programs in place to take care

STERIS PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

of those who need extra support and providing paid furlough for those people in operations that were
impacted by a decline in the business due to the pandemic. Total cost for COVID-19 programs and
expenses were $4.5 million in our second fiscal quarter, about half of what we saw in Q1.

Similarly, our approach to investments has not changed. We continue to expand our AST footprint and to
invest in R&D. We have introduced a full suite of surgical products this year, including new operating room
lights, several new surgical tables and a next-generation ORI system. On the infection prevention side
of our business, recently launched products include our new smaller footprint steam sterilizers and more
rapid biological indicators, among others. We do not expect a consequential slowdown in our new product
development efforts or in spending for R&D as a result of the pandemic.

Before we open to Q&A, I would like to again thank STERIS people for their commitment to our customers,
who have continued to be the heroes on the front lines of this pandemic. While there is uncertainty in
the near term given the COVID-19 situation, we like the positioning of our global portfolio during the
pandemic as well as when we come out of it. We are working toward completing the previously announced
acquisition of Key Surgical by calendar year-end and look forward to welcoming Key's people to the
STERIS family. We stand ready to capture additional opportunity and continue to believe that the long-
term future for STERIS is bright.

With that, I will turn the call over to Julie to open for Q&A.

Julie Winter
Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications
Thank you, Mike and Walt, for your comments. Jamie, would you please give the instructions and we'll get
started on Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

And our first question today comes from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities.

David Louis Turkaly
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

For Mike, maybe 100 basis points, you talked about in price. I know you may not want to get into super
detail about that, but I think that's a little better than what you've seen of late. And I was wondering if
you just might comment on where you're gaining that, and particularly in this environment.

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Dave. Yes, 100 basis points. Typically, we are somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points. This
quarter, obviously, we were at that 100 basis points level. And we are actually seeing price across all 3 of
our segments in the second quarter. So I would not point out one individual one, but just across each of
our segments.

David Louis Turkaly
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division

Great. And then as a quick follow-up, you mentioned you called out some working capital improvements.
I'm just curious if we should view some of those as permanent or is it sort of a onetime? Or how are you
looking at some of those improvements? And how should we look at them moving forward?

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Dave. I would say that from a working capital improvement standpoint, we've actually been
successful in reducing our days sales outstanding pretty significantly this year, although that is a little bit
of math, if you will, because as EBIT does drop, the days sales outstanding do increase or decrease year-
over-year. And we have been offsetting inventory. Inventory is on the rise. We continue to have higher
inventory levels because we are maintaining both surety of supply and we are level loading.

So I would say that DSOs, favorable a couple of days. We should be able to continue to drive that at
least this -- the remainder of this fiscal year, I don't know about next fiscal year. And I would also say
that inventory, our projection is inventory would still be elevated by the end of the fiscal year. So I would
say those 2 will pretty much naturally offset, and we will continue to see. As long as we see net income
growth, we will continue to see free cash flow generation.

In addition, our capital expenditures are also up, and we -- as we've spoken about many times, we do
anticipate spending over $100 million in expansion capital growth for AST. So don't be surprised if you see
year-over-year growth in CapEx by the end of the fiscal year. We were up $13 million in the first half, and
we project to be more than that up for the full year.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

And I would add another temporal one is government tax payments have been deferred related to the
Pandemic Act. There's a mixed bag there. I would say, obviously, the government payments are temporal.
Capital spending is more longer term. And I think, as Mike has said, the -- if you look a bit longer term,
the inventory and receivables will probably reverse back to their more normal levels over time.

STERIS PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

And our next question comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I didn't quite catch all of the guidance for the back half. Did you say you're going to be year-over-year flat
for the full year on an organic growth basis? And what are you -- what does that -- what are you implying
for the second half versus the first half?

I just -- I didn't catch it all. I just wanted to clarify.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Matt. We're not guiding, just to be clear. But we have to plan even independent of the fair amount of
uncertainty that's going on. And so we're planning roughly flat year-over-year revenue. And it's -- that's,
largely speaking, kind of all the same constant currency, not constant currency. There's essentially no --
in fact, I think no inorganic growth in the back half of the year. So that's an irrelevancy unless Key comes
in place, and we're not talking about Key. But orders of magnitude, we're kind of thinking flattish, and
it's our consumables business or recurring revenue business is continuing to grow with some, I'll call it,
conservatism on what capital is going to do for the back half of the year.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Understood. And then the contribution, just for clarity purposes, the contribution from tuck-in M&A
over the next several quarters, I'm assuming that wanes a little bit as those anniversary?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

0.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Or what do you -- 0?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

0. It's tiny this quarter. Mike?

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

About $5 million this quarter, Matt. And by the time we get to the third quarter, I believe, almost every
one of those will anniversary. So it will be, if not 0, very, very close to 0. So we won't even speak to it.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

All right. I think everyone is happy about that.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

We're unhappy. We like to have more, but we've got a significant one coming, so that's fine.

STERIS PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

All right. And then the Life Science receivables business. Maybe I'll ask if this is -- I'll ask it this way. What
is the capacity you could -- you're about a $200 million business right now, plus or minus. What is the
capacity you could produce if customers said, "Just give me everything you got. Are you kind of maxing it
out at this point at plus 30%? Or could you actually kind of flex that up even further?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We're not capacity constrained at this point, Matt. And barring the ability to get the components,
which I'm not aware of any, where we are struggling. So -- but you always have to pay attention to supply
chain issues. But barring some supply chain issue that I'm unaware of, we could go up a great deal. You
have to remember that most of our work in this space in IPT and Life Science are sharing factories. And so
the capacity of those shared factories is greater. Now if everything goes up 50%, then that's a problem.
But the capacity that we have in the combined Life Science AST facilities, I don't feel that we have a
significant capacity issues.

Matthew Ian Mishan
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

All right. Excellent. And then I realize this last one, I realize it's a tough question given volatility and the
overall breadth of your portfolio. But how much do you think you're outperforming your end markets with
share gains? It just seems like you're just well above of where the market would be.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

I don't know about quantity. And particularly in short terms, Matt, it's very difficult to have a feel for us
versus everybody else, if you will. As everybody reports, it's helpful, but we have a lot of competitors that
are not public. So it's still difficult to get that overall reach. But I think we are confident that we're getting
more than our fair share of wallet in virtually all of our spots.

Operator

Our next question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I guess first question here is one of the really interesting things about the STERIS portfolio is that you
essentially have all these different businesses that can benefit and service hedges within. During the
pandemic, they obviously supports the business that are impacted as well. So really, what I was just
trying to understand for the quarter, is there any way to help quantify what you think the amount of
tailwind was for revenue in the quarter? And conversely, what you think the amount of headwind was for
the quarter?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Well, Larry, I guess, I mean, that's a tough question to answer. But I think the easiest way to quantify it
overall is we're running flat, which is better than again, the segments that we tend to work in. All things
being equal, about flat in revenue. And we did not anticipate pre COVID being flat. So we would have said
we would plan on being up. Probably this year, we would have expected to be up high single to maybe
even into the low double-digit numbers.

And as a result, I would argue that it were probably about 10% negative headwind versus tailwind,
plus or minus a little bit. So orders of magnitude, that would be our best answer. And it's -- the places
are obvious, right? In AST, where we're doing PPE and in Life Science, where we're gearing up for
the vaccines. We're getting a nice tailwind but we're a procedural-based company in health care and
procedures have gotten beat up. So that's been the opposite side of the equation.

STERIS PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Very good. Two other ones on Life Sciences. So Walt, I guess I'm just trying to, again, understand
how we should think about the exposure there to vaccine production. So I'm wondering if you can talk a
little bit about are you exposed more to one type of vaccine technology versus another? Are you exposed
to very specific customers that if they make it through, that's a positive and if they don't, that perhaps
doesn't impact -- positively impact you as much.

And I guess the other part of that question is, as you've seen the improvements in the business and the
profits come through, how are you -- are you letting that drop to the bottom line? Are you investing that?
Again, I'm just trying to think forward a little bit on this as to how you manage the margins as you come
off the other side of this?

Daniel A. Carestio
Senior VP & Chief Operating Officer

Larry, this is Dan Carestio. Maybe I can give you a little information on the market, in particular. With
vaccines, that's really in STERIS' sweet spot in terms of our [ portfolio ]. Everything [ assumed ] is,
by definition, aseptic manufacturing. So it's manufactured in a sterile environment and near sterile
clean rooms, and the products that we sell and the services that we have are used to ensure that those
environments can operate in an aseptic manner.

And in addition to what we're selling into vaccine from Life Sciences, we've also seen a significant uptick
in demand in AST in terms of bioprocess precursor. These are bags or liners or tubing sets and things like
that used in aseptic manufacturing, specifically for vaccines.

And I wouldn't say that any one company or another in terms of the customers we serve is more -- has a
higher demand or a lesser demand based on their methods. They're all basically very similar methods in
vaccine production, and all require an aseptic environment.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

And Larry, I guess we're broadly enough across. Obviously, if all of our best customers happen to be the
lucky ones, we're better. And if there's a couple that are not our best customers, are the hot ones, that
will be a little worse. But I think we're pretty confident that the pre-buys that we're seeing are a function
of the people who are likely candidates. So we're pretty comfortable that we will see an ongoing effect.
And I think in the short to intermediate term, it's unlikely it's going to shrink. It's just that can't keep
growing 30% a year forever.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And on the margin question around are you investing against the improved profitability there? How
are you doing that?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Great question. Part of the margin expansion is strictly a function of mix. And so some of that's, I'll
call it, just natural. But -- and secondly, as most companies, I think we were not at all clear how ugly this
thing was going to get when it started. And so we shut down hiring in certain places. We kept spending in
the R&D functions. And I call it the long-term future, we kept spending. But on the short to intermediate
term things, we kind of took a step back. And we'll pick some of that back up as we see the, I'll call it, the
long-term look going forward.

We're increasingly comfortable, as you might expect. But there's still a lot of uncertainty out there, and
we're watching it. Normally, we watch quarter-to-quarter, we watch week-to-week right now. And there
are so many things going on, some of which can be very positive and some of which could be not so

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

STERIS PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

positive. And so we're just being careful. So we'll lag the spending piece probably a little bit for a while,
and then we'll catch up at the appropriate time.

Lawrence Soren Keusch
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then last one for me. AST margins just continue to be very impressive and continue to move
higher. How do we think about -- are these kind of -- do you think this is kind of peakish margins here?
Are you -- as some of this incremental volume comes in, whether it be around Life Sciences or other
sterilization needed for the pandemic, is that coming in at a higher price and that's influencing the margins
higher? Just again, trying to think about how we should really think about that longer-term margin in that
business.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Sure. The AST business, as you know, and we're very happy with the margins in that business, obviously,
but that's ROS. And when you're plowing $100 million or so every time you turn around to grow capacity,
the ROIC is not extraordinary. It's good. I mean we're not complaining about the ROIC in that space. It's a
very good investment. But we're putting a lot of money to make that money in place to make that money.
So I would not characterize it as over the top in terms of when you look at ROIC, so we think there's room
for improvement as those new facilities mature. It's -- if you look back and you were with us quite some
time ago, when every time we added a plant, we had to knock off 50 to 100 basis points because each
plant affected the overall ROS.

Today, we have over 50 plants, so 1 plant doesn't make that much difference. But if you look plant by
plant, those newer plants are not making the kind of money on an ROIC basis -- well, on ROS or ROIC
basis that the than the older plants are. So it's a function of those things.

Operator

And our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens, Inc.

Christopher Cook Cooley
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Well, maybe if we could start with a big picture one here this morning, kind of following on what Larry was
getting at there. You structurally have a lift with your Life Science and AST franchises seeing accelerating
growth. You've taken some costs out of the model. Clearly, there's planned investment going forward. But
should we also see over the next 18 months as the business starts to normalize hopefully from COVID?
Should we see a natural lift as well in cash flow in the business versus historical levels? Or how do we
think about cash flow generation, not so much for the back half of this fiscal year, but more so on kind
of a go-forward basis? Should we see a natural lift there? Are there uses of cash that will start to pick up
there? And then I've just got a couple of follow-ups.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Chris, I would say both in cost and as a result in cash. There's a lot of, I'll call it, sales and marketing
expense that's not going on in the world right now. And it has a limited detrimental effect because none
of our competitors are spending that money either. But when we return to the more real world, I suspect
strongly that we and our competitors are going to put boots on the street more and travel more and do
a number of things more that we cannot do. So that will have some normalization effect on earnings and
cash will follow naturally with that. So I think that's point one.

Point two though, your points well taken as we grow in profitability and we have mixed more toward
some of those higher profit areas, then that profitability will flow through in cash completely. And then
the only question is, how much we're spending either in acquisition or for organic growth in order to --
the use of that cash? And we fully intend to spend as much as we can for those 2 things because that's
what the future cash flow generations are. But if you pull out the investment side of it, yes, the cash will

STERIS PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

grow. Again, we would hope to be able to spend as much of that as possible to grow in the future in a
reasonable way organically and through acquisition.

Christopher Cook Cooley
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I appreciate that color. And then maybe just 2 quick follow-ups for me. The first, could you just remind us
when the last time was that you had resolidified your raw materials contracts, more specifically for Cobalt
60 on that front? A lot of discussion about that here as of late, as I'm sure you're aware. And just want
to revisit when those were last revisited and kind of the terms of those agreements. And then one other
quick follow-up.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Chris, appreciate the question. We do not get into the details of our vendor contracts, just like we don't
get in the details of our customer contracts. Suffice it to say that we have visibility for a reasonable
time. We tend to do both of those on a long-term basis, particularly in the AST business. And kind of
everybody, the suppliers, the vendors and the customers recognize that everyone's in a better spot if we
all know what we can and cannot provide and what people are going to do and not do. So those tend to be
intermediate to longer-term contracts. And that's the case across the board.

Understood. Appreciate that. And then lastly and then I'll get back in queue. I just want to make sure I'm
squaring my assumptions correctly. So your -- and your essentially flat directional planning for the full
fiscal year ex Key Surgical. You are not assuming, I guess, any incremental headwinds from COVID-19 in
the back half of the year or you are still assuming some incremental headwinds, maybe whether it's from
procedure softness as you cited parts of Europe now already experiencing that or maybe it's purchasing
patterns. I know in prior conversations on these calls, we've talked about hospitals carrying a little bit
higher consumable inventory on-site than what they had in the past. Just wanted to make sure I fully
understand what you're baking in when you're talking about getting to flat year-over-year for the fiscal
year ex Key Surgical appreciating that there's a tough fourth quarter comp.

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Chris, again, I'm telling you we were planning, and that plan could change next week or next month.
So -- and that's why we're not giving guidance. There are so many uncertainties right now, both positive
and negative, that we think it's uncharacteristically difficult time to forecast. But having said that, in
general, we're not anticipating a huge reduction in procedures like we saw in April, May, June or into
March, April, May. We're not anticipating that level of reduction, which was pretty catastrophic. But we will
-- we do expect temporal changes kind of spot changes around. That's kind of built into our thinking. We
-- again, we do expect -- and part of that is, one offsets the other a bit. If we have a little more of that,
we have a little more PPE process. We have a little less. We have a little less PPE and a little more of the
procedural devices.

So we're balancing those issues and our best view of that is that we come out about flat. Having said that,
it is -- we still, given the history that we've seen to date, which is about the best thing we have to work off
of and how nice a job the facilities have done with the treatment protocols of COVID-19. I think that's kind
of grossly misunderstood and underappreciated. The facilities around the globe and the physicians and
nurses around the globe have really improved their knowledge of how to deal with this disease. So even as
it heats up some, they're a lot better positioned to take care of patients. And as a result, have done things
to be able to continue to operate their procedural spaces. It would only be, in my view, unless it goes a lot
worse than anticipated, it would only be patients deciding due to concern of COVID that would reduce the
-- procedure is a great deal. So we just have to wait that one out.

But in general, we are expecting some spot issues around the globe, but not an overwhelming reduction
like we saw before. We're expecting to see some additional PPE in processing as a result. And clearly,
we're anticipating good growth or good volume in the Life Science business for vaccine production. So
at a high level, I'd say that's pretty much it. We are being a bit cautious in our view of capital. Even
though orders have come back quite a bit better than we expected, being flattish recently is better than
our anticipation. But capital can bounce a little bit, so we're being a little cautious on our thinking about
capital.

Our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company.

Michael Stephen Matson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

I just want to ask about gross margins. I mean they were up a fair bit year-over-year, and it sounds like
some of that was driven by mix. So is that something that's sustainable? Is that something that could
potentially go the other way if your growth rates kind of revert back to more normalized rates in the
different businesses?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would say the single biggest thing on the quarter is that you saw that Healthcare capital was down
and kind of everything else was up. And so that is a mix effect. So as Healthcare capital comes back
over a longer period, you'd expect that mix down. On the other hand, if it comes back and everything is
still growing, and we do see AST and Life Science growing faster in general than most of the health care
space, it's still a positive impact, kind of long-term temporal impact on margins, in my view.

Michael Stephen Matson
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just wanted to follow-up on Larry's question about the Life Science business and the
potential impact of the vaccine. So how do we think about that business as the vaccines start to be
launched? I mean does that mean that the demand for your consumables would then decline because
there's been kind of destocking orders? Or would it remain strong as the vaccines are rolled out?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We don't have perfect visibility to that. If we did, we'd probably be giving strong differential guidance
than what we're giving. But that's a tough call. My experience is in this space that the vaccine or I would
call the pharma folks who are running these facilities are the most conservative of our customers when
it comes to supply chain. So my suspicion is they're going to hold a fair amount of inventory for a long
time until they know that they are in good shape and have -- know what they're running, know how much
they're going to have to build and know what their requirements are going to be. So I don't think in the
short term, there's going to be a huge reduction.

As we work through this, if indeed they're overstocked, they will slow it down. And if they're not, they
won't. But generally speaking, they tend to be kind of conservative on supply chain, appropriately
conservative. Those factories, you shut one of those things down, you're shutting down millions of dollars
a day, not millions of dollars a year. So they're pretty careful about their supply chains.

But again, we do not have perfect visibility just like we don't have perfect visibility to who's going to be
building when. But I should also mention another effect of this has been our capital and -- I've talked
about capital in Healthcare being at risk. Our capital in Life Sciences is at all-time records, all-time record
backlog, all-time record shipments. I mean everything you want to look at. So the capital equipment in
Life Science is quite strong, and we don't see that subsiding in the short to intermediate term.

Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay. That was very helpful. And then just on the -- I heard your commentary around the orders
improving since they kind of bottomed in May, but it does look like the Healthcare backlog was down kind
of double digits year-over-year. So is that just more of a lagging indicator or something? Is that why that's
not showing a kind of better year-over-year change?

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

Yes. It is. You may recall that in the first quarter, we had accounting change that resulted in roughly $15
million of ORI being recognized in the first quarter. That number for this quarter is probably more in the
$10 million to $12 million range. But -- so if you look at this based on a similar approach, you would
see that the backlog is roughly the same, plus or minus a little bit. But -- so it's down, but it's not down
double digits. And so that's it in the short run. But capital has been under pressure, more pressure than
many of the consumables. And we just have to see -- just -- it's nice to see that the replacement business
seems to be returning, which is roughly 60% of capital orders. So we will see the next several months. It's
been sequentially moving in the right direction, and we hope it continues that way.

Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Baird.

Michael K. Polark
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Just a couple here. Curious on PPE and AST. Walt, do you have a view -- did volume from that category in
total flat sequentially versus the June quarter up, down? I'm just curious how that piece is trending.

Daniel A. Carestio
Senior VP & Chief Operating Officer

Yes. This is Dan. I think it's been more governed by supply than it has been demand at this point. And as
the suppliers have ramped up on the raw material, we're seeing similar levels that we saw in Q1, maybe a
slight uptick. We do believe there'll be sustained increased demand at some level for PPE on to the future
as the requirements for those products for certain procedures have changed even with or without the
pandemic.

Michael K. Polark
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

As you fill back up and PPE stays at these kind of elevated new norm levels, let's assume and electives
recover and presumably, your global network is quite tight, hence a significant amount of CapEx going into
AST. Are there other issues that arise where preference is discussed between where you make decisions
about who gets access to the facilities and when? Or is there enough capacity such that those frictions
don't arise? I'm just curious how that -- in a world over the next handful of quarters as we learn to live
with this, selectives recover, PPE stays elevated. Is there a risk that your capacity gets very tight?

Daniel A. Carestio
Senior VP & Chief Operating Officer

Well, one, there's a reason why we're building a number of plants right now across the globe in North
America, Europe and Asia. We have more builds going on in AST than ever in my lifetime right now
because we see long-term increased demand. In terms of customer capacity constraints at a given site,
it does happen from time to time. And we work with our customers across that, validate our multiple
methods of sterilization so that for some period of time, it may not be optimal for their supply chain, but
we can get the products sterilized into the market.

CEO, President & Director

I would say Mr. Carestio always tells me that it's like Jell-o. There's always room for Jell-o, so there's
always room for one more customer.

Michael K. Polark
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And I'm sure you're not, yes, running facilities at every hour of the day? Or is that...

Walter M. Rosebrough
CEO, President & Director

No, we are. Except for essentially Christmas Day in the Western world, we run 24/7.

Michael K. Polark
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. The other topic was SG&A. I just -- I know you're not putting a fine point on the back half. But in
the context of an ex Key Surgical revenue expectation of flat year-on-year, how would you frame SG&A
dollars for fiscal '21 in the context of that revenue outlook? Reasonable to expect those dollars are flat? Is
there quite a bit of so such that the ratio is similar year-on-year for the full year? Or what do you expect
variance one way or the other?

Michael J. Tokich
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Mike, for the first half, obviously, we saw a lot of favorability there. In the second half, we would
say there's going to be favorability, but nearly not as much. And then obviously, for the full year, we
would expect to see a decline in total. And then obviously, as we look to the future, we will give guidance,
hopefully, at that point in time when we know more. But definitely, definitely anticipate that we would be
spending more operating expenses in the second half of the year versus the first half.
