Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the third quarter earnings conference
call. [Operator Instructions]

It is my now pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Steve Filton. Please go ahead, sir.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Thank you, Good morning. Alan Miller and Marc Miller are also joining us this morning, and we welcome
you to our review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020.

During this conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates
and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not
familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a
careful reading of the sections on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,
2020. We'd like to highlight a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to
questions.

As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS
per diluted share of $2.82 for the quarter. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the
supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS
per diluted share was $2.88 for the quarter ended September 30, 2020.

As of September 30, 2020, we have received approximately $396 million of funds from various
governmental stimulus programs, most notably the CARES Act. Included in our reported income for the 9
months and 3 months, respectively, is approximately $213 million and negative $5 million of net revenues
recorded in connection with these stimulus programs. For the 9 months, approximately $161 million
of these revenues were attributable to our acute care facilities and $52 million were attributed to our
behavioral health facilities. In addition, during 2020, we received approximately $695 million of Medicare
accelerated payments, which had no impact on our earnings during the first 9 months.

As previously discussed in our first quarter conference call, beginning in mid-March, the incidence of
COVID-19 and suspected COVID cases increased in our acute facilities and correspondingly, the volume
of non-COVID patients declined significantly. These declines in patient volumes generally continued into
the first half of April. Beginning with the second half of April, our admission and patient day metrics
began to rebound. By the first half of May, local authorities had lifted restrictions on elective surgeries
and other procedures, and those volumes began to rebound sharply as well. ER visits, while also
gradually improving, have been the volume unit slowest to recover, but the increased acuity of our patient
population suggests, at least in part, that the more acutely ill patients tended to return to the ERs and the
less acute patients were the ones continuing to avoid that care.

In late June and continuing throughout the third quarter, most of our hospitals experienced the second
wave of COVID cases, although to date, this second wave has not been accompanied by the same
magnitude of non-COVID case declines that we experienced in the first wave in that March-April time
frame. Generally, our hospitals were able to better prepare for this second wave with greater ICU and
isolation room capacity as well as more ample inventories of PPE.

The behavioral health segment experienced a similar pattern of volume changes, with patient day metrics
hitting a trough in early April and incrementally recovering for the rest of the quarter. Despite a number
of headwinds, including a decline in referrals from acute care emergency rooms, from schools which have
not fully returned in-person learning and from travel restrictions on potential patients, patient days at our

behavioral health facilities improved during this year's third quarter to approximately 97% of the volume
realized during last year's third quarter.

As we noted in the first quarter, our paramount concern throughout the COVID crisis has been taking
all the necessary steps to keep our patients and employees as safe as possible. We did, however, also
recognize the severe financial stresses created by the COVID crisis, and we undertook a series of steps
to mitigate the dramatic revenue declines and to protect our capital structure, including cost reduction
initiatives across all of our expense categories. Our approach in this regard, especially as it relates to
labor expenses, has been a balanced one, reflecting our expectation that the dramatic decline in volumes
would in many instances be temporary in nature, and also recognizing the severe strains that the crisis
has created on our employee caregivers.

As the crisis has continued, it has increased the pressure on our ability to staff our hospitals at competitive
wage rates and to meet current demand level. We've also implemented a suspension of our share
repurchase and quarterly dividend programs. As a result of these actions as well as the funds received in
connection with the governmental stimulus programs and Medicare accelerated payments, the company
had closed to $1.45 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2020, along
with approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents.

While we are strongly encouraged by the mostly stable volume trends in the quarter, we acknowledge
the potential material impact that COVID-19 could have on our future operations and financial results.
And since the nature of these COVID developments are largely beyond our ability to control, we have
continued to withhold any further guidance -- earnings guidance for the balance of 2020.
We would be pleased to answer your questions at this time.

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Andrew Mok with Barclays.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Wanted to follow up on the strong pricing in both segments this quarter. On the acute side, can you give
us the surgery statistics for the quarter and give us a sense for how acuity trended on a comparable basis,
excluding COVID patients?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Sure, Andrew. So I would suggest that the drivers of the really strong acuity on the acute side are,
number one, the acuity of the COVID patients themselves. COVID patients, I think, on average, have
a case mix that is about 50% higher than non-COVID patients. So that's a driver. Our non-COVID case
mix is also up. And one of the things, I think, that we note and hear from our hospitals is that at least
a portion of the patients who come to our hospitals have delayed or deferred their care during the
pandemic. And so when they come to the hospitals, they tend to be more acutely ill than they would have
been had they come sort of at a -- on a more timely basis.

And then finally, consistent with what I said in my prepared remarks, I think that the absence of -- the
decline in emergency room visits, we believe, is largely concentrated in the lower acuity patients. So the
mix of patients we have is, by nature, are a higher acuity mix because so many of those lower acuity
patients are absent from the emergency room.

Andrew Mok
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. And on the behavioral side, the length of stay moderated on a sequential basis but revenue per
adjusted admission remains strong. What supported the strong pricing there? And how should we think
about the sustainability of that in Q4 and into 2021?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Sure. Because the behavioral revenue per adjusted patient day was as high as it was, we certainly
did a deeper dive ourselves to try and understand. I don't know that there's one particular element of
explanation. I think we found that we are getting the benefit of some higher contractual rate increases.
We're seeing the impact of a little bit more leniency on the part of managed care companies in terms
of things like denials and concurrent utilization management. There were small amounts of positive
reimbursement adjustments in this quarter and also some negative adjustments in last year's third
quarter. Again, none of these were material. My gut, Andrew, is that, that number at 5% to 6% revenue
per day growth will moderate some next quarter and probably more into that 3%, 4% range.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Realize that you're not wanting to give guidance here, but would you be willing just to tell us what are
maybe some of the headwinds and tailwinds that you're thinking about as we contemplate 2021?

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. I mean the way that I think we're thinking about the business, and I think our results in this quarter
are emblematic, is that on the acute side, broadly, and I think our peers have seen very similar trends,
we are seeing some more-moderated volumes than we were seeing prepandemic, but those lower
volumes have largely been offset by higher acuity. The reason I think we'd be reluctant to give any further
guidance is we don't know how the COVID trajectory is likely to play out over the course of the fourth
quarter and into next year. And until, I think, some of those trends are more stabilized, it would be difficult
to say.

But I think that, again, what we were able to demonstrate in the third quarter is that we could produce
acute care bottom line growth with lower volumes and higher acuity. I think our sense is that as the
COVID crisis stabilizes some, volumes will increase and acuity will decline, and we'll start to approach
metrics that look a little bit more like what they look like prepandemic. But the cadence of that and the
trajectory of that is what, I think, we find challenging to project.

On the behavioral side, I think what we have found is that there are a number of obstacles, several of
which I tried to enumerate in my prepared remarks, that are preventing our behavioral hospitals from
getting back to prepandemic volume levels. They're a little bit short of that. But they've largely made up
for it through, again, higher revenue per day as well as strong cost-cutting initiatives. Again, I think we
have a perspective that as the COVID crisis stabilizes, behavioral volumes will increase, the timing and
cadence of that is what's difficult to predict.

Matthew Richard Borsch
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

If I -- just 1 follow-up on the behavioral volumes. Do you agree with the characterization that COVID has
perhaps created a larger bolus of people needing mental health services? Or is it just too much of a mix of
things to make that call?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So I think -- and again, what I tried to say in my prepared remarks, Matt, is that, I think, COVID
has created some practical headwinds for the behavioral business. The decline in emergency room visits
has clearly affected our referrals from emergency rooms, which are a significant source of behavioral
patients. The intermittent sort of return to schools has certainly affected our adolescent referrals from
school systems. Some of our hospitals rely reasonably heavily on travel, patients who are traveling, and,
obviously, that's been diminished.

So we're actually encouraged by the fact that our behavioral volumes are as high as they are, given these
other dynamics because as your question suggests, we do believe that the COVID crisis has created a
significant amount of incremental stress on the entire population, and obviously, particularly on those who
are predisposed to have behavioral issues. So again, I think we have a view that as the country returns
to sort of more normalized patterns of work and school and travel, and I'm not exactly sure when that
will be, but when that occurs, I think we believe that there is a reservoir of behavioral volumes still to be
satisfied.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. I wanted to ask if you could give a little color on the Las Vegas market. I wanted to see if you're
seeing anything substantially different in the trends there as far as the economy goes or volumes and
payer mix.

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Sure, Kevin. I mean, I think, that it's fair to say that almost all of our acute care hospitals, certainly all of
our larger acute care hospitals, whether they're in the District of Colombia or South Florida; Vegas; Texas;
Riverside County, California, were in geographies that were considered COVID hotspot in the third quarter.
So the dynamic of more COVID patients, we clearly saw an acceleration of COVID patients in the third
quarter in virtually all of our markets. We saw an increase in acuity that we've already discussed. Again, I
think that was largely all across the board.

Many of the markets that I enumerated are also experiencing higher levels of unemployment than the
national averages. I don't think that at least at the current moment, we've seen a really significant impact
of that yet in these geographies, I think, in part because, and I think our peers have mentioned the similar
dynamic, a lot of the decline in ER volumes seems to reside with those poor paying or patients with a
lesser ability to pay. So we've seen our payer mix remain relatively stable despite the fact that we're in
markets, including Las Vegas that are experiencing some higher unemployment. Obviously, specifically to
Las Vegas, how that economy rebounds and how quickly it recovers, I think, is dependent in large part on
travel patterns and particularly airline travel patterns.

I think that the Vegas market reports, for instance, that casino volumes amongst the local population,
people in Las Vegas and Nevada and California and Arizona, are pretty strong, not all that far off from pre-
COVID levels, but these are, for the most part, people who are driving to Las Vegas. I think those tourists
who are coming by airline to Las Vegas are down much more significantly. And how quickly that rebound,
et cetera, will be, I think, is determinant of how quickly the economy recovers in Vegas. But again, at the
moment, I think that's a little too hard for us to speculate on.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then I guess, when we think about the acuity improvement, are you actually seeing
year-over-year growth in high acuity non-COVID patients or is acuity really driven by COVID and then just
a lack of low acuity patients, that low acuity is dropping faster than high acuity is dropping, but high acuity
is also still dropping?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So as I said in an earlier response, I mean, I really think it's 3 things, and you enumerated 2 of them.
The COVID patients themselves are much sicker and more acutely ill than the non-COVID patients. The
absence of the lower acuity patients sort of mathematically drives up acuity. But we are also finding that
non-COVID patients are coming in generally more acutely ill, and we attribute that dynamic to the idea
that many patients are delaying and deferring care so that when they do come to the hospital, maybe
a month or 2 after they've started to experience whatever symptoms they're having, they may well be
sicker than had they come on a more timely basis.

Kevin Mark Fischbeck
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So you would say that your actual -- that high acuity patients are actually up year-over-year despite total
volumes being down?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes.

Our next question will come from the line of A.J. Rice with Crédit Suisse.

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I want to wish best wishes to Alan and Marc as they transition roles there. Maybe to look at your cost
management, which looks like meaningfully positive there. I guess the rate increase -- or the relative rate
increase, pricing helps on that. But it looks like labor and other operating expense did show a nice year-to-
year trend. Is that also a function of some of the cost initiatives? Can you tell us where that stands? And
I noticed that was true for both acute and behavioral that you saw similar -- or you saw improvements in
labor and other operating expense?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

No, I think that's accurate, A.J. I think you have to put all this in context. So in mid-March, when the
COVID crisis really first began in earnest, and we saw this dramatic decline in non-COVID visits and ER
visits and elective and scheduled procedures on the acute side and behavioral patient days almost sort
of complete sort of lockdown across the country. It was very difficult to predict where the business was
going, what we would be dealing with, et cetera. And so both our business segments and our operators,
I think, took dramatic and prudent steps to try and rightsize the labor force and rightsize our hours in
response to the demand declines.

And obviously, we were fortunate and both businesses have recovered relatively quickly, and demand
has come back. But I think, again, both -- operating managers in both segments have been prudent in
restoring the labor that had been sort of rightsized. And so I think we benefited from that clearly in Q3. I
think as the demand continues to increase, I think labor will continue to also increase and be rightsized.

But one of the dynamics are, it's difficult to make dramatic cuts to labor in the hospital business
because after you adjust for the immediate demand, now you're cutting into fixed and semi-fixed costs
and overhead costs, et cetera and that's difficult to do. But once it's done, I also think that there's a
sustainability kind of aspect to it. And we saw this during the recession -- The Great Recession 10 years
ago, where there were some pretty dramatic cuts made at the beginning of the recession and they were
relatively slow to be restored. And I think you're seeing some of that same dynamic here today.

Albert J. William Rice
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And then a follow-up one would be around your ER volumes, I guess, are down 26% if I've heard
that right. Two things, I guess, on that is, you're saying it's mainly the low acuity. So the percentage of
those ER visits that end up on the inpatient side, are you seeing that increase and sort of validate the
thoughts that people that are showing up are sicker? And what it would be in a normal environment? And
then on your outpatient volume in general, is that also still lagging substantially in terms of coming back
or is that doing better than what you're seeing with the ER?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

So in response to your first question, we are clearly seeing what we describe as a higher conversion rate
of ER visits. That is, a much higher percentage of people who are coming to the ER are being admitted
to the hospital. And I think that's a function of exactly what we've been talking about, which is the lower
acuity patients, the scrapes and bruises and ear infections and strep throats are not necessarily coming,
but the cardiac patients and stroke patients are coming and so they're being admitted at a greater
frequency.

As far as the second question goes, I think a big -- at least on the acute side, the decline in ER visits is
what's driving a lot of the outpatient decline. Obviously, there's a lot of attendance sort of revenue that
goes along with an ER visit, it could be pharmacy, it could be radiology, it could be lab. And so to the
degree that ER visits are down 25% to 30%, we're going to see outpatient revenues in that other -- in
those other areas down as well. Outpatient surgeries, scheduled and elective surgeries have remained
pretty strong. They're not at pre-COVID levels, but they're pretty close and stronger than ER volume
certainly.

Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Sandler.

Sarah Elizabeth James
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I was hoping that you could update us on where you are on catching up on delayed procedures. And it
would be really helpful if you could break that out into procedures that were delayed from the first half
versus the third quarter.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

So Sarah, what we said last quarter was elective and scheduled procedures had come back by the middle
of June to something pretty close to pre-COVID levels. And then with that second wave that began in
late June and certainly carried into July and for most of the third quarter, we saw a moderate step back
in those elective and scheduled procedures. And it is varied by market because in the markets that
go through particularly significant COVID wave, you see more pressure on those sorts of things. But
generally, I would say that for the third quarter, across the portfolio, elective and scheduled procedures
have been in that sort of 90% to 95% range of pre-COVID levels, although it does vary by market and it
does vary by the markets that are experiencing COVID surges.

Sarah Elizabeth James
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Does that mean that the delayed procedures have been rebooked? So I'm just trying to parse between the
surgeries that were for a specific quarter going through versus the catch-up being completed.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So I think it's difficult. And I know some of our peers have given some pretty precise numbers about
that. I think it's difficult to say. When we schedule a surgery or we schedule a procedure, it's difficult for
us to know sort of when that patient was originally seen by their doctor, whether they were sort of in the
pipeline, whether they were deferred, et cetera. We don't really become aware of the patient until they are
at their hospital procedure schedule.

So I would say our experience in large part has been that in that sort of mid-April to mid-May time frame
as physicians returned to sort of more normal practice patterns that they did just that. They returned
to their more normal practice patterns. If they did surgeries 2 days a week and office hours 2 days a
week, that's largely what they did. Some physicians certainly made more of an effort to catch up and get
through the backlog than others. But I think we have a feeling just generally that we haven't really seen a
bolus of catch-up and that the rate of surgical procedures that we're experiencing is certainly sustainable.
It's not like -- I think, we have a sense that there's been a bolus and now we're going to see a real dip
just because we've worked through that bolus.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Going back on behavioral demand. Can you give us a little more color on sort of what segments you saw
strengths and weaknesses during the quarter? Any geographic areas with strengths and weaknesses? And
any color on where you exited the quarter on behavioral demand? Anything you can tell us about October
would be great.

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

It's a little hard to answer the question, Pito, about the behavioral division only because the geographic
dispersion of our behavioral facilities is so much more confused than it is on the acute side. What I will say
just sort of generally is our behavioral hospitals in markets where there was a COVID surge tended to be
impacted more than in markets where there weren't. So -- and again, through some of the reasons that I
enumerated earlier, ER volumes would go down in a market where there was a COVID surge. People were
staying at home or they didn't want to necessarily, again, go to what we would consider to be the normal
access point to hospital ER, mental health center, private psychiatrist office and so we were challenged
there.

We're also challenged in our behavioral division. When we get a COVID patient or COVID patients because
we're not as prepared necessarily as we are in the acute care hospital. So we'll create and isolate a unit,
a 10-bed unit or a 15-bed unit for COVID patients. But if we only have 1 or 2 COVID patients, it's more
inefficient, quite frankly, than it tends to be on the acute side. So other than making the point that, I
think, probably the most variable sort of element that we're seeing in our behavioral volumes is the
incidence of COVID patients in the market and in particular facilities, that's sort of the one overarching
observation I make.

Alan B. Miller
Founder, Chairman & CEO

It's -- Steve, it's well agreed that COVID has had a very detrimental effect on general mental health.
Number of suicides, number of depression, alcoholism has all gone up. And as the COVID-19 gets better
treatment, which we'll see in the future, I think we're going to see a volume of these patients come to the
hospitals, which they have been avoiding now because of the COVID-19 threat.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And actually, my next question was either for Marc or Alan. Relative to your peers, the balance
sheet is definitely running under-levered versus everyone else. I understand there are a lot of issues going
on with COVID and Medicare funds and grant funds going around. But in general, how should we think
about leverage ratios going forward? Are there any minimum levels where we can assume the excess free
cash flow goes to share repurchases? I'm just trying to understand how far sort of deleveraging can go
before it finds a floor.

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Pito, let me respond quickly. And then certainly, Alan and Marc can add their perspective. We certainly
acknowledge that we're in a very favorable capital structure position and leverage position at the moment,
and we feel comfortable with that. We still feel like there's a significant amount of uncertainty in the
business, obviously, not just for UHS but broadly for the country and the hospital business in general.
There's lots of speculation that things could get worse from a COVID perspective as the winter progresses
and with the holidays coming around and people are less strict about their social distancing, et cetera. And
I'm not wanting to tell you how that's all going to play out.

But I think from our perspective, we'd like to probably get to the other side of the New Year at least and
then sort of take a step back and recalibrate where we are, et cetera. But feel certainly at the moment
that we're in a really strong position. And if that continues, I think that we would have every intention to
resume our share repurchase and dividend programs early next year. But certainly, if Alan or Marc have
further thoughts, they can weigh in.

So that means that we have a relatively consensus view of things, so -- and it's good, by the way.

We have always been conservative. We've never had or sought to have a problem with regard to funding.
And that's the case at the moment. So that will continue. That will always be Universal. I mean, we will be
prudent with regard to our cash and our cash expenditures.

The next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Steve, can you give us a sense of COVID admissions in the quarter and maybe revenue contribution?
And then just give us a sense maybe more broadly of the month-to-month volume trend and any early
indications for October within the acute segment?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. Ralph, I mean, COVID admissions in the third quarter were about 12% of our total acute care
admissions. That was a significant increase over the second quarter where, I think, it was probably a 5%
was the equivalent number. The trajectory of it was that July was clearly the peak and then we saw the
COVID cases come down in August and then come down again a little bit in September.

Data for October is a little bit harder to give you with precision because we've got the complication of the
cyberattack that occurred late in September and our recovery was ongoing for a good chunk of October,
and we continue to backload some of our data, et cetera. So we don't have as sort of good information
as we would at this point in a month as we might otherwise have. But, I think, our general sense is that
COVID volumes are relatively stable in October with the exception of a couple of hospitals that have seen
pretty significant surges.

And I think you all read about the -- just on that revenue -- you asked about the revenue contribution. I
think I mentioned before in a previous response that the case mix index of COVID patients was about 50%
higher than non-COVID patients. I don't have the exact revenue -- sort of the commensurate revenue
information. But, I think, order of magnitude, you would expect revenue to be similar.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I wanted to go to the just general sort of rate backdrop. First on
the Medicaid side. Obviously, some fairly hefty cuts in Nevada, I believe. So, I guess, what's the outlook
for rates in Medicaid next year? And then if you could just touch on the commercial rate backdrop as well.
Just give us a sense of maybe how much you've locked in for '21 and '22? And maybe a rough range of
what those rates are and if there's still generally 3 years in length?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. I think the percentage of long-term contract is not as great as it was a few years ago. I mean, I think,
we're largely locked into our 2021 rates, although it's fair to say that we're always working with our payers
where we think our rates might be undermarket or there has been a long time since we've gotten what
we believe to be reasonable rate increases, particularly on the government side of things. I think on the
commercial side, that process tends to be a more sort of regular and scheduled process. When I say the
government side, I'm talking about Managed Medicare, Medicaid and particularly Medicaid.

Look, I think we have a point of view that the managed care companies across the board are doing quite
well, and they're doing quite well in large part because of a reduction in provider payments during the
pandemic. And so where -- we think that our rates are not sort of competitive. We're going to use that
particular data point as yet another way of working with the payers to get what we think are fair rates.
And obviously, that's a 2-way process. So we'll push forward, they push back, and hopefully, the end
result is one that's fair to both parties.

The next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

I think you've talked to a couple of points here that may be part of the answer. But the basic question
is, do you make money fee on low acuity patients? It just seems like the low acuity is disappearing. I
understand there's a little bit more high acuity patient mix. But EBITDA doesn't appear to be impacted by
this. Or is it just significant cost-cutting is kind of hiding the impact and you do make money on those low
acuity patients?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. Look, I think it's a pretty broad question, Josh, and maybe difficult to answer in a pervasive way. But
I think we've always made the point that low acuity patients in the ER are probably not very profitable.
And again, I cited the bumps and bruises and strep throats and ear infections before. But I think we've
always had the view that those patients for a variety of reasons are probably more effectively treated
somewhere else in the system, in large part because the overhead in the hospital and the overhead in the
hospital ER is much more significant than it would be in a lower acuity setting like an urgent care center or
a retail pharmacy clinic, that sort of thing.

At the end of the day, I think we have a point of view, however, that we are probably able to earn a
reasonable profit on any patient that is insured, whether they have Medicaid, Medicare or commercial
insurance. The real challenge with hospitals and with emergent -- acute care hospitals and emergency
rooms, in particular, is that uncompensated burden. And again, one of the interesting things in this sort
of pandemic environment seems to be that those lower acuity patients who are not coming to hospital
emergency rooms tend to be also the lower-paying Medicaid and noninsured patients. And I think that's
partly why that decline in volume has not been as costly to hospitals as you might have otherwise
expected.

Joshua Richard Raskin
Nephron Research LLC

That's perfect. And then just taking a step back. Has the pandemic made you think differently about
your geographic concentration, specifically in the acute care segment? Is there sort of an opportunity to
juxtapose that with the balance sheet conversation to help struggling systems in other urban areas? Is
this a time where you should be thinking about your financial strength being able to help others?

Marc D. Miller
President & Director

So I'll take this. This is Marc. Our development activities have continued throughout the year, almost at
the same clip as they had pre-COVID. That said, a lot of the deals aren't closing right now. There's a lot of
conversations. You read a lot of articles about systems all over the country that are struggling. But most
or many of them are not at the point where they're making determinations to change from their current
situation to something new.

That said, I do think we're laying groundwork for the future, near and longer term, where something like
that could happen, either within current acute care markets, which we're most familiar with, or other
markets, either markets where we have behavioral presence but not yet acute care or markets that we
don't play in right now, but we track for different reasons, mostly because there's opportunities there,
possible future opportunities. So I do think that, that might happen, but we're not seeing that happen
right at this time.

Sounds like it's more on their end than your end. It sounds like you guys, Marc, are well prepared and sort
of waiting for those systems to figure out where they are.

Marc D. Miller
President & Director

Yes. And it gets back to that cash issue on the balance sheet. We are -- we always take a conservative
approach. I think we're in a great financial position to move when there's an opportunity. So we want to
remain in a good financial position so that when that does happen, we can make decisions quickly. So yes,
I would agree with you, though, that a lot of those things are on the other side. And when they -- those
health systems do make their determinations, we'll be ready to act.

The next question will come from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.

Gary Paul Taylor
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Most of my questions answered. But I just wanted to go back for a moment. Steve, just on the acuity
again. And I missed just the first couple of minutes, but did you actually break out on that net revenue per
adjusted admission, the acuity versus the payer mix contribution? And you talked about the COVID CMI
being higher. Do you have the actual change in your overall or your non-COVID CMI in the quarter?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So I think that the CMI for COVID patients in the quarter was something like 2.4 and for non-COVID
patients was 1.6, and I talked about it being about 50% high, but those are the actual numbers. As far
as the payer mix acuity, I don't think we touched on that other than I know that some of our peers have
talked about their higher revenue in the quarter being driven by sort of a combination of higher acuity and
improved payer mix.

I think for us, it is more an acuity issue than a payer mix issue. I did say in an earlier response, I forget
exactly what context, that our payer mix was sort of stable in the quarter. And I think, as best as I can
speculate, the reason that we didn't see some of the improvement that our peers saw is because of our
elevated level of COVID patients who, I think, tend to be more Medicare and less commercial. So with a
higher percentage of COVID patients, we didn't necessarily see the same improved payer mix that some of
our peers saw.

Gary Paul Taylor
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And is there anything -- and I'm sorry if I missed this and just move on, if we did. But on the
IT sort of system attack that you had, is there anything contemplated where you feel like there's some
additional spend in terms of IT infrastructure going forward?

Alan B. Miller
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, I think, that at this point, we're still going through forensic audit to make sure we understand
exactly what happened here. We have a robust security apparatus here. And even with that, we did get
hit. We are reviewing everything having to do with our cybersecurity. We've got a very strong internal
cyber team, and then we work with various external partners, some of which are nationally known names
that others work with as well. So we're reviewing all aspects at this point, and we have not made any
determinations as of yet as to how we might want to spend dollars either differently or enhance our
spend. But we will be continuing to review this to make sure that we are as secure as possible going
forward.

The next question will come from the line of Nicholas Aponte with PNC.

Nicholas Aponte;PNC;Analyst

Given the increase in unemployment under insurance and noninsurance, have you made any changes to
your provisions on collectability or allowances?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So we have, and I think as most hospitals have over the last several years, enhanced our revenue
recognition or conversely, our bad debt or charity care recognition to make it more precise, more accurate
so that in real time as patients are presenting to our hospitals we're identifying their ability to pay
their insurance or lack of same, et cetera. So those have been in place for quite some time. I think
that, therefore, if payer mix deteriorates as a result of higher unemployment as we move forward into
continued levels of higher unemployment, we're in a position to recognize that from an accounting and
financial reporting standpoint in real time, and we'll do that.

What I was saying earlier is I don't think we're seeing that yet. And I think there's a variety of reasons for
that. I think while some employees are being furloughed but they're keeping their health benefits. Some
employees who are being laid off were able to access COBRA. Some employees who were laid off deferred
their procedures, if that's possible, if they're not emergent.

What we have seen, if you go back and you look at the experience in The Great Recession 10 years ago,
for instance, is that unemployment increased pretty dramatically, but the impact on hospitals in terms
of elevated levels of uncompensated care increased more incrementally over a 2- or 3-year period. Now
obviously, the unemployment created by the pandemic occurred probably faster and more -- in a more
accelerated manner than it did back in The Great Recession. But to some degree, I think you're seeing
that same delayed effect. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see more uncompensated care in the future, but
it will probably be a more gradual incremental sort of impact. But I believe our reporting systems are well
established to be able to do that properly.

Operator

The next question will come from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens.

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

First question. Just interested in your thoughts on the latest CARES guidance that came from HHS in
October. I know that the guidance from HHS has really been a moving target. But just, Steve, interested
in terms of, first, which is the guidance you were using in terms of accounting for the third quarter?
And then whether directionally that did seem to become a little bit more accommodating as it relates to
booking loss revenues relative to the prior September guidance?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. Scott, so you raised a good point. So first of all, I think we took the position along with our outside
accountants that the way that we recorded the CARES grant revenues in the third quarter was based on
the HHS guidance that was effective as of September 30. And as you pointed out, and I saw you had
a note out this morning about one of our peers, HHS has made a couple of changes to that guidance
subsequent to September 30.

I think there are still things that we'd like to clarify with HHS or have a better understanding with HHS
before making any firm decisions. But, I think, we have a point of view that there's a reasonable chance
that when we take into account the revised HHS guidance and clarify some of the things that we think are
not absolutely clear today, we'll be able to properly record more CARES revenue and incremental CARES
revenue in Q4.

Scott J. Fidel
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just had a follow-up question and would be interested in just your
perspectives on the labor dynamics right now in the acute care hospital side. Just as it relates to -- there
have been some headlines more relating to some of the peers around the unions and some contentious
situations that have risen relating to demands there. And just interested in your perspective on whether
you see this as just a typical noise or if the pandemic just continues to drag on, whether those types of
situations could ultimately drive increased wage pressure over time?

Alan B. Miller
Founder, Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean, we're certainly watching what's happening with our colleagues. I think, at our hospitals,
we try to pride ourselves on having open lines of communication and making sure that our employees
understand what our thought -- what our thinking is for the decisions that we're making. So as far as
we're concerned, I think we're in a good position right now. I do think that there are some cost pressures
on the labor side, where some systems that are struggling are throwing dollars at this. And so you do
see anecdotally in certain specific areas where you have some people jumping for a couple of bucks here
and there. But as far as labor strike and some of the other things, we've been fortunate that I think that
because of the way we manage and communicate with our employees, thus far, we've been able to avoid
some of the things that we see happening at some of our competitor facilities.

The next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just kind of a couple of other quick follow-up numbers questions for you. Steve, I think yourself as well
as most of your peers during the third quarter, when you were at a conference or things like that, were
talking about, my recollection was, kind of mid-single-digit declines in patient admission. It looks like you
were closer to the high single digit. Just curious how inpatient admissions overall kind of trended through
the quarter and into October? Did September take a step down or am I recalling that incorrectly?

Steve G. Filton
Executive VP, CFO & Secretary

Yes. So -- and just have a little trouble hearing you. So if I don't answer your question on point, you can
clarify. But I think you were asking about our overall absolute admission numbers. We did disclose for
the quarter in our selected statistics table overall admission decline, which I think on the acute side was
about 9.5% versus the 17% on the adjusted side. And obviously, the difference is the decline in outpatient
volume, which, I think, again, based on the earlier questions was driven by that emergency room decline
more than anything else.

As far as sort of the trajectory of cadence during the quarter, I talked about a little in the context of
COVID. COVID definitely peaked in July and then declined for us in August and September. And I think
our non-COVID volumes sort of have the opposite trajectory. I think our overall volumes were relatively
consistent during the quarter.

Justin Lake
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And into October, you're seeing similar?

UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 30, 2020

And again, I'm going to have to take a little bit of a path on that as I sort of indicated in an earlier
question. Because of the cyberattack, our information on October is still not perfect. But my gut is that we
saw a bit of an interruption in our volumes in the early part of October, some ambulance diversions and
some canceled surgeries. But I think by the end of October, things were largely back to normal, but it's
just difficult to be a whole lot more precise than that at the moment.

Operator

Our final question will come from the line of Whit Mayo with UBS.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just 1 question on the cybersecurity development, and I appreciate the comments on the robust IT
infrastructure. I'm more curious what this really means sort of out in the field with your operators. I
presume that you've got contingency plans that you've put into place to periodically take hospitals off-line,
work on paper and so your clinicians and operators are probably well prepared for this. But just any color
on the contingency plans and thoughts about just the field level disruption that perhaps this may have or
may not have.

Marc D. Miller
President & Director

Well, you actually said it right there. I mean, we go off-line often for different maintenance updates and
things like that. So our plans are -- have been put into practice many times. That said, when you're in
a regular downtime and you know it's going to be for a period of time, I don't think there's the level of
stress that you get when something like this happens, where you don't know how long it's going to last
for.

But saying that, we've all been incredibly impressed, not just with the leadership from our IT folks but
from all the leaders on both sides, both divisions right down to the folks on the patient care level right at
the bedside, how they've handled this. They really worked diligently to keep perspective, make sure that
we were able to treat patients in a safe and efficient manner. If we were worried at all that, that was not
the case, then we slowed things down, we delayed procedures where necessary.

But I do think that our preparations for things like this really paid off for us because most of our hospitals
were able to act in a fashion that we would have hoped would have happened but you never really know
until something like this happens. And I think that was another reason why we saw just the ability to get
back up and running so quickly because we did things in a very organized and efficient manner. So I do
think that all of those policies and procedures played out well. And all of that said, I hope it never happens
to us again, but we'll continue to enhance those protocols just in case we have to deal with that again.

Benjamin Whitman Mayo
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Good luck on the new role, Marc.
