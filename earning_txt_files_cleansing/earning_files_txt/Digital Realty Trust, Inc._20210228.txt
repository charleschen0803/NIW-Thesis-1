DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to Digital Realty First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Please note, this event is
being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Due to time constraints, we will conclude promptly at the bottom
of the hour. I would now like to turn the call over to John Stewart, Digital Realty's Senior Vice President of
Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.

John J. Stewart
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief
Investment Officer, Greg Wright; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and Chief Revenue Officer, Corey
Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.

Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and underlying assumptions.
Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our
10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.

This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the
supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.

Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our first quarter results. First,
we demonstrated our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and
socially responsible capital raises and corporate governance enhancements. We continue to enhance the
value of our global platform, extending connectivity offerings globally, recycling capital and investing to
fuel high-quality organic growth.

We delivered solid financial results with core FFO per share up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead of
consensus. Finally, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, lowering our weighted average cost of
debt with the redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity while extending our weighted average
duration with the issuance of attractively priced long-term capital.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.

Arthur William Stein
CEO & Director

Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation
is a global, connected, sustainable framework. And our first quarter results demonstrate the strength
of this framework. Our business is increasingly global with first quarter bookings very evenly balanced
across regions. We continue to align PlatformDIGITAL with our customers' digital transformation initiatives
by expanding our unique interconnection capabilities focusing on connecting centers of data across our
robust, reliable global platform. Last, but not least, we continue to advance our initiatives to deliver
sustainable growth for all stakeholders.

Let's turn to our sustainable growth initiatives here on Page 3. We were recently honored to be named
EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for Energy Management for the second year in a row. We were
also recently honored to receive the 2020 largest financial corporate Green Bond award from Climate
Bonds Initiative. We expect to publish our third annual ESG report during the second quarter, providing
transparency on our ESG performance for 2020 as well as a comprehensive overview of our clean energy
commitment, resource conservation, diversity, equity and inclusion and other sustainable business
practices.

We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs
of our customers, our investors, our employees and the broader society.

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

In terms of our social efforts, we recently joined leaders across 85 industries in signing the CEO pledge
on CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, an initiative to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
Our Board of Directors also amended our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director candidate
pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender.

Finally, in February, our Board of Directors amended our Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee charter to formalize oversight of our ESG programs, including sustainability as well as diversity,
equity and inclusion. We are doing our best to play a constructive, proactive role in advancing our broader
goal of delivering sustainable growth for all our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees and the
communities we serve around the world.

Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. We continue to invest in our global platform with 44
projects underway around the world, totaling more than 300 megawatts of incremental capacity scheduled
for delivery over the next 18 months. Half of this expansion is underway in EMEA, while the balance is split
roughly evenly between the Americas and APAC.

In EMEA, we continued our extension of the highly connected legacy Interxion campus in Frankfurt. and
began construction on the Neckermann expansion campus. During the first quarter, we broke ground on
the first 26 megawatts on the expansion campus, which are scheduled for delivery next year. Demand in
Frankfurt remains strong. And our campus, with access to over 700 carriers and ISPs, continues to attract
customers from around the world. In France, we are adding capacity in Marseille as well as Paris.

Demand in Marseille is largely driven by the 14 subsea cables that terminate in our facilities, where we are
transforming a former abandoned World War II U-boat bunker into a modern and vital communications
hub for over half of the world's population.

In Paris, we continue to develop interactions with Paris Digital Park, while the Dunant subsea cable that
links Paris to Virginia Beach was connected in our Paris campus during the quarter. We are also expanding
our highly connected Brussels campus and breaking ground on another facility in Madrid to serve the
broadening needs of service providers as well as enterprises.

In APAC, we recently announced the grand opening of our third data center in Singapore. We were
particularly pleased to be recognized by Singapore's Desmond Lee, Minister of National Development,
highlighting the sustainable design of our most energy-efficient data center in the region. Despite some
COVID-related construction challenges last year, we were gratified to be able to deliver this highly
connected and sustainably designed facility to meet customer needs in our tightest market.

Finally, in mid-March, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680
million, executing on our strategy of recycling capital from stabilized assets, reinvesting proceeds into
higher growth opportunities while prioritizing long-term value creation over near-term earnings growth.

Let's turn to demand drivers on Page 5. We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular
demand drivers. Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point that enables us to detect
secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. In the second half of last year, we introduced
to our customers the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that projects the growing intensity
of the enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure.

In the first quarter of this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto enabling
connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration for our customers as they tackle data
gravity head-on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. Recent third-party research continues
to support the growing relevance of data gravity. Market intelligence firm Gartner recently hosted an
executive retreat and surveyed over 400 Chief Data and Analytic Officers, with 83% of CEOs expecting
to increase investments in digital business with a large percentage of these firms prioritizing digital data
products to drive growth.

With this transition to data-driven businesses, Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 75% of
companies will deploy multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics, sharing and governance.
We are seeing growing momentum across our enterprise and service provider customers deploying their
own data hubs and analytics environments in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL.

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

As I mentioned earlier, Digital Realty was recently named ENERGY star Partner of the Year by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency for the second consecutive year. This award reflects
our sharpened focus on driving sustainable design and operations on PlatformDIGITAL, underpinned by
ambitious science-based targets to significantly reduce our carbon footprint by 2030. We are honored by
the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global data
center demand opportunity from data-driven businesses.

Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform to
meeting these needs, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for
customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. We signed total bookings of $117 million
in the first quarter. including a $13 million contribution from interconnection. Network and enterprise-
oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less totaled $33 million, building upon our consistent momentum and
demonstrating the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of
enterprise demand. The weighted average lease term was over 7 years. We landed 100 new logos during
the first quarter with strong showings across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global
platform.

The mix of our new signings was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA each contributing approximately 30%
and the Americas accounting for the remaining 40%. In addition, nearly 40% of bookings were generated
within the megawatt or less plus interconnection category with strength in the e-commerce, gaming and
financial services segments.

In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a particular highlight of the quarter
was landing a leading APAC-based diversified digital economy platform in Singapore, where we were able
to support this customer's needs across our full product spectrum, from colocation and connectivity to a
hyperscale dedicated data hall.

Elsewhere in APAC, a leading cloud service provider expanded with us simultaneously in both Melbourne
and Osaka. Subsequent to quarter end, we landed a leading cloud provider to anchor our Tokyo campus
in Inzai, where we've assembled a runway of over 100 megawatts of growth capacity as well as key
magnetic connectivity solutions.

In EMEA, an automotive digital technology maker deployed an artificial intelligence, machine learning
footprint on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to a community of leading cloud service providers on our
Frankfurt campus. In the Americas, a leading cloud provider expanded on our campuses in Sao Paulo and
Rio de Janeiro. A Global 2000 industrial manufacturer leveraged a partner to deploy on PlatformDIGITAL to
support growing demand, enabled by our global platform and runway for growth on our suburban Chicago
campus.

A global digital advertising exchange platform expanded its presence on PlatformDIGITAL to gain access to
connected data communities in the Northern Virginia metro area. Also in Ashburn, a leading video game
developer selected PlatformDIGITAL to build centers of data exchange. And finally, a global IT service
provider expanded in multiple metros across North America to enable new services on PlatformDIGITAL.

Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced reached
another all-time high at $307 million. The step-up from $269 million last quarter reflects $66 million of
commencements during the first quarter, offset by roughly $104 million of combined space and power
leases signed. The lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term
historical average at just under 8 months.

Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. We signed $193 million of renewals during the first
quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

the first quarter was a little less than 3 years, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1
megawatt. We retained 75% of expiring leases, just a bit below our long-term average. Cash re-leasing
spreads on renewals were negative 2.1%, which was in line with guidance, but weighed down by 2
customers who were new to existing capacity as part of the expansion of their footprint on our platform.
These transactions were prime examples of what we mean when we talk about our holistic, long-term
approach to customer relationship management.

We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that
we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide
a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as
well as renewals.

In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 100 basis points,
driven by anticipated churn in Ashburn as well as the sale of 11 almost fully leased facilities in Europe.
Same-capital cash NOI growth was negative 2.8% in the first quarter, in line with guidance and largely
driven by the same Ashburn churn.

As a reminder, our recently acquired Westin Building in Seattle, Interxion across EMEA, Lamda Hellix in
Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool. But we expect each of these
acquisitions will be accretive to our organic growth going forward.

Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the first
quarter but still remains somewhat depressed relative to the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX
tailwind in the first quarter. As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt
to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from
an economic perspective.

In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by
proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. Given our
strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point
move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact on full year FFO per share.

Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded.

In terms of earnings growth, first quarter core FFO per share was up 9% year-over-year and $0.09 ahead
of consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecast was driven by a beat on the top line with an
assist from an FX tailwind as well as operating expense savings primarily due to lower property level
spending in the COVID-19 environment and a later than budgeted closing on the noncore European
portfolio sale.

A portion of the OpEx savings is likely timing related and represents more of a deferral rather than
permanent savings. But substantially, all of the beat flows through to the raise, and we are taking core
FFO per share guidance up by $0.075 at the midpoint.

In terms of the quarterly run rate, we still expect the split between first half of the year and the second
half of the year to be approximately 49-51. In other words, as you can see from the bridge chart on Page
12, we expect to dip down by about $0.10 in the second quarter before ramping up fairly steadily over
the rest of the year due to the mid-March closing of the noncore European portfolio sale as well as an
expected catch-up in OpEx spend previously budgeted for the first quarter.

I would like to point out that although we are raising our G&A forecast by $15 million at the midpoint,
our implied EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged as the lion's share of the increase is due to geography
on the income statement as we finalize mapping the Interxion cost structure and have recharacterized a
portion of Interxion's OpEx spend as overhead.

In terms of our financing plans, we've already made great strides this year with a highly successful EUR
1 billion green Eurobond offering in early January at 5/8, in addition to the proceeds from the asset sales
in March. As always, we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year, and we may look to capitalize

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed-rate financing at attractive coupons across the
currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities.

Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 13. As previously mentioned, we closed
on the sale of a portfolio of 11 assets in Europe for approximately $680 million and used the proceeds to
pay down debt, bringing net debt to adjusted EBITDA back down to 5.6x, in line with our long-term target
range. Fixed charge coverage reached an all-time high of 5.8x, reflecting the results of our proactive
liability management. We continue to execute on our financing strategy of maximizing the menu of
available capital options while minimizing the related cost and extending the durations of our liabilities to
match our long-lived assets.

In early January, we raised $1 billion of 10.5-year green Eurobonds at an all-time low coupon for Digital
Realty of 0.625%. We also retired $350 million of 2.75% bonds due in 2023, and we repaid all $530
million (sic) [ $537 million ] outstanding on the term loan due in 2023. In mid-April, we announced the
redemption of $200 million of preferred stock at 6.625%, also bring total preferred equity redemptions
over the past 12 months to $700 million at a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25%, effectively
lowering leverage by another 0.3 turns.

This successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which
provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and
enables us to prudently fund our growth.

As you can see from the chart on Page 13, we've extended our weighted average debt maturity out to
nearly 7 years while ratcheting our weighted average coupon down to 2.3%. A little over 70% of our debt
is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and acting as a natural FX
hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate
environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.

Finally, as you can see from the left side of the Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term
debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but
also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-
term financing strategy.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator, would
you please begin the Q&A session?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. .

Jonathan Atkin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I wanted to ask a question about, I guess, customer retention as well as about new logo generation. As
we look at your pending lease expirations out through year-end '22, any kind of update you can give us
on which markets might have greatest exposure? And is there a way to characterize how much of that you
would consider to be highly likely to renew or extend their commitments?

And then on the -- kind of on the new business that you're bringing on. If you think about your sub-
megawatt or low single-digit megawatt colocation wins, any way to characterize how much of that has a
high kind of connectivity attach rate to it? And more broadly, I wondered if you could maybe just review
initiatives that you have underway to enhance productivity in your direct and indirect channels to manage
those ongoing relationships.

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jon. Maybe I'll try to attack some of the numbered questions on the beginning, and I'll hand it
over to Corey to talk about our channels and productivity. So just to cut them up in a little bit of order
here. So I would characterize -- going to your second question about how much of our less than megawatt
colocation is kind of connectivity rich. I would characterize that as a highly connectivity rich piece of our
business in terms of the numbers of our customers, the 4,000 customers that we have at Digital, the
lion's share of the customer count falls in the -- they sit in typically some of our more highly connected
destinations, either dating back many years to our legacy Telx business or Interxion or Westin Building or
where we've organically grown our colocation connectivity suites across North America.

I think we have 5 markets across Asia Pacific and elsewhere around the globe. So you typically see fairly
sticky, high retention, low churn as well as fairly substantial pricing power quarter after quarter. And you
could see that in the retention table in the [ back of our cell ]. And the definition didn't change all that
much when we migrated from the word colocation to a sizing definition.

I think the first part of your question was, call it, look at the expiration schedule, I thought I heard a post
year-end 2022. I'm not sure my crystal ball can go with that much precision, out that far. I would say,
thematically, we've been working through a few years now of more tougher sledding when it came to our
expirations, and that was in 2020, 2019, 2018. That was in size of the volume of the expirations. That was
in the mix of the expirations in terms of kind of going back to more higher -- less pricing power locations,
chunkier deals, concentrations of some multi-market, major customer renewals.

I think we've done a nice job chopping a fair bit of wood, and the front view mirror on the expiration
schedule certainly looks better than what we've come through. And I think you've seen that now in terms
of how our mark to market has called -- has been progressing in back into a better fashion as we kind of
worked through some of those lumpier contracts. And then you're going to see it on the percentages of
where the expirations kind of fall between the plus or minus megawatt category.

So it feels like we're heading in the right direction on the expiration schedule. And I didn't touch on it, but
definitely geographically, just by the maturity of our business, much more non-U.S. or out, call it, EMEA,
APAC type expirations into the future, which also, call it, higher barrier entry, tougher or high pricing
power markets. But I'll turn it to Corey to hit the -- your -- the last part of your question.

Corey Dyer

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Yes. Thanks, Andy. And Jon, thanks for the question. I think I kind of captured it, and can you correct
me if I missed it, but you asked a question around channels and how we're doing there. And then a little
bit about with the new logos, are we getting an increase in interconnects, I think, are the questions. And
Jonathan, if I missed it, then you can always clarify later.

But I would tell you that really happy with the progress we're making on channels. Of our, I'll call,
enterprise business nonscale business. The channel is now about 1/4 of the business, so we're pretty
happy with the progress there.

And then on your question around new logos and how much of the new logos are adding interconnection
to it, we've seen an increase in that. They really kind of just comes through when you think through
PlatformDIGITAL and how we're getting many, many more multi-use case deployments, multi-site
deployments. Most of those look like network connectivity as well as some control hubs. And so we're
seeing good progress across those. And we're seeing, I guess, the net of it is the channels bringing us a
lot more new logos and those new logos are a little bit more interconnection dense than they were in the
past. Hopefully, that answers the questions.

Jonathan Atkin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. I was -- just given the talent you brought on from Interxion and then a lot of legacy Equinix people,
such as yourself, that are onboard, just interested in any kind of machine learning, AI, predictive analytics
tools you are considering. Yes.

Corey Dyer
Chief Revenue Officer

Oh, okay. Yes. Thanks. That's a good question. Yes, pretty familiar with that. I'll tell you that you
referenced a few places that some of us have been, so we're not going to comment on what they're
doing. But I would tell you that, yes, we do use, call it, AI and I'll say, target-based data sets for both
our prospects, our customers. And I'll tell you that we use data, and that's really what the essence of the
Data Gravity Index was. It was a -- Data Gravity Index published based on data and what we see in the
industry. And it really helped us identify the shift in the infrastructure placement and connectivity that's
required across the full spectrum colocation. And so I feel like we're doing pretty good across both those,
Jonathan, using AI, using data to make our decisions to how we target our customers. So pretty on top of
that for you.

Operator

Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. .

Jordan Sadler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I wanted to just touch base on sort of the connectivity piece of the business. It looked like there was some
particular strength in interconnection this quarter sequentially, in particular. And just kind of curious if the
pacing and the growth is something that's sustainable that you've potentially got some momentum there
or if there was anything in particular that drove it.

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Jordan. I would say all -- in total, volume connectivity new signs was up. I think in terms of, call
it, lumpier concentrations, our Latin America portion of the portfolio was certainly a major contributor.
In terms of the top markets for just overall the interconnection signings, in North America, it was some
of the usuals, the New York Metro, Chicago, Atlanta. But also, I did notice we had some pretty strong
connectivity growth in both our Northern Virginia campus as well as our Franklin Park, Chicago campus, so
not necessarily a legacy highly connectivity dense location, but it's great to see some enterprise is landing
there and growing their connectivity footprint.

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

In answer to -- partly answer Jon Atkin's question. When we track our new logos on a year-over-year
growth basis, we don't have this for all of our new logos because we're kind of combining businesses
over the last year. But I'll call it the legacy digital subset that were here a year ago, they grew their
connectivity footprint north of 10% on a year-over-year basis. So the new logos are growing post landing
with us.

So definitely pleased. And I mean, I think it goes back to a lot of what Corey was saying about our
reorientation across the board in terms of bringing us some of the critical puzzle pieces together in terms
of our asset profile, our go-to-market strategy, led by Corey, our PlatformDIGITAL and branding to the
market and many other elements, I think, are tied together that's been driving that success.

Jordan Sadler
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just honing in on Northern Virginia. You touched on it there on the connectivity. But
what's your availability looking like in that market? And how -- what are you seeing in terms of customer
demand there for this year?

Arthur William Stein
CEO & Director

Northern Virginia, Jordan, obviously, you're aware we had a pretty incredible 2020, close to 85 megawatts
sold overall. We kind of ran pretty darn tight on inventory based on that success, which is not necessarily
a bad thing given that the Northern Virginia market has been kind of working its way out of the woods for
some time now. So we ended the year with our development pipeline 100% pre-leased. We are now under
construction and delivering, building our -- in terms of our new build that will come along this summer. We
did close to 5 megawatts of leasing in total in that market, including the full product suite.

I would say the lion's share of our focus is on the capacity we got back at the very beginning of the year,
some of which I mentioned, we already released or pre-leased on the last call. So really focusing on
some of that non-retained capacity on our existing campus. But also, we did land an anchor deal, a little
chunkier enterprise deal into building our kind of on the back half of the year. And then building on it a
large shell that, we'll call it, deliver 6-megawatt suites in, call it, every other month type of a fashion. So a
little tight right now, focused on where we're pushing customers but a longer, larger runway with building

Our next question will come from Michael Funk with Bank of America.

Michael J. Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

So first, I'm wondering if your posture or your approach to rental rates and renewals has changed at all in
the last 12 months given the tightening in some of the markets.

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

I mean I think we have a pretty responsive pricing dynamic holistically, Mike. So it's not just on renewals.
We have a, call it, inventory price book for every type of capacity, for every duration of contract, for every
market, for every product that is updated on a recurring basis in response to what we see in terms of
the supply-demand dynamics in the market. We obviously did have certain overlays in terms of customer
relationships or the larger growing customers or newer customers that we kind of make sure we're
responsive to at the same time.

We're certainly not sitting by idly when a market is weaker, and we need to respond to that with pricing
to be more competitive. And on the other flip side of the coin, we've had experience like in Singapore
or other markets like Santa Clara or Frankfurt, where we've raised rates over time. And those rates are
impacting our renewals and our new pricing in response to, call it, the overall supply-demand dynamic.

Michael J. Funk
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then one more, if I could, Andy. So on the guidance, I saw the noncore expense add-back increased
for 2021. I didn't hear you call that out in the prepared remarks. What was the increase in the noncore?

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

The increase in the noncore, I believe, we got a whole list of items in our FFO reconciliation that kind of
hits the noncore that includes our investment in Megaport is -- because the stock price marks to market
when that flowed through, and then obviously is in the core up or down to our business.

I believe there's a revaluation on our debt at Ascenty given it's a Brazilian entity and we have a U.S.
dollar-denominated debt to match the currency of the lion's share of our contracts. And we also have,
I think, in this particular quarter, a little bit of a benefit from our PPA settlement that we added back
because we didn't view that as a recurring benefit to our core FFO.

Operator

Our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.

Simon William Flannery
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. Maybe I could go back to Corey. Can you talk about where we are on sort of return to normal in
terms of the sales process in some of the regions? Are you still able to get the virtual tours and get the
connections? Or do you think there's still more room to come back to normal here?

And then any commentary on the supply chain? I think you did talk a little bit in your disclosures about
generally not seeing huge issues, but in terms of building costs or building up inventory there.

Corey Dyer
Chief Revenue Officer

Andy, do you want me to take the enterprise demand question and just [ state the usual ] and then you
could follow on the second half?

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Please go ahead.

Corey Dyer
Chief Revenue Officer

Okay. All right. So yes, thanks for the question. I would tell you that we're getting closer to the state of
normal, if that's what you want to call it. Some of the things are opening up. But we've got a lot of ability
around doing tours virtually. We've found a bunch of different ways to augment the needs and take care of
our customers during the pandemic. So I feel like we're getting close to it, we're not quite there.

That said, enterprise demand has been really, really good. It's been strong, broad-based success selling
our platform. Andy mentioned it earlier, but early innings with long tail left. And we're looking through
some the more macro trends. Gartner's got IT spending getting a 6% growth with about $4.1 trillion
annually and only about $400 billion of that going to public cloud. So we think that enterprise demand and
the point of presence and the multi-use cases as well as multi-markets that we're going after are going to
be there. And we're seeing it continue to sustain.

So I wouldn't say that it's a complete back to normal. We haven't seen a dip in the enterprise demand.
And quite frankly, we think we've done a pretty good job adjusting through it with all the ops and the
[indiscernible] working through it. I hope that answers the question. I'm not sure if I did.

Simon William Flannery
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

No, that's great.

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Simon, can you just repeat the second part of the question to make sure we...

Simon William Flannery
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. It was really around the supply chain issues and what you're seeing in terms of the COVID impacts
on your ability to bring on data centers on time, on budget. And any cost issues you might be seeing or
inventory issues?

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Okay. Great. So let me take the kind of our digital supply chain, and I'll let Chris touch on the customer
supply chain because I know that's been a question out there as well. So I mean, I think, really, hats off
and kudos to our operational design construction team and supply chain team for really keeping ahead of
this consistently. Obviously, we do all have the benefit of our scale, our global nature, our deep operational
expertise. But we have not in recent quarters had any, call it, disruption to critical equipment delays, cost
impact And so the team really has done a really incredible job navigating through that.

I'm not sure that's the case for all providers in the data center world, especially smaller stature. But
there's not been disruption today. And I'd say we've looked at our, call it, 300 megawatts of capacity under
development as pretty darn insulated to these -- any potential inflation shocks. And we're also keeping a
keen eye on that. But Chris, why don't you hit on the chips piece as well.

Christopher Sharp
Chief Technology Officer

No, absolutely. I would echo your sentiment, Andy. The vendor management program that we have in
place today, I think, is something that has allowed us to overcome some of the shortcomings of some
of the infrastructure within the facilities like breakers, optical infrastructure, things like that. But that's
something that operating on a global basis has been a big benefit to digital going forward. But we also
stay very close to our customers and really watching if they're having trouble procuring infrastructure to
deploy their architectures into our facility.

We haven't seen a material impact on that as well. I know there's been a lot of concern around chip
shortages and things like that. But again, just to reiterate, not all chips are the same, and there's a lot of
variability out there. And so we have not seen any kind of material impact from customers being able to
deploy into the facility. And quite frankly, some of our larger hyperscale customers, they build the entire
stack themselves, so they have strict control over their supply chain. And so they've also not experienced
any slowdown in being able to deploy the massive amount of infrastructure required for their deployments
as well.

Operator

Our next question will come from Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho.

Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So when I look at the updated guidance, it seems like the only major change there really is the FX
assumption around the pound. So is it fair to assume guidance is going up simply because of changes
in FX assumptions? Or is there something also kind of operationally, there's an improvement that, that
should also be signaled through the guidance increase?

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Tayo. The -- I mean, the sterling is, especially today, a much more smaller piece of our
business, pro forma for some of our acquisitions over last year. So while FX did contribute to our, call it,
outperformance in the first quarter, and obviously, that flows through the guidance, I would not say that
was the only thing that drove our increase in guidance.

We did have a beat in terms of our internal forecast and was, call it, in the same ballpark as where
consensus was. We've essentially raised a few elements, the revenue, the EBITDA. The G&A piece is really
just the P&L geography you're mapping from Interxion integrations. And then we also kind of made sure
that showed that, that flowed through to the bottom line with, call it, an increase at the midpoint of the
range, up, I think, $0.075, so 5% year-over-year growth. And not all due to FX. It was due to some of the
operational outperformance.

Not all of our beat flowed through because some of it was OpEx delayed from 1Q to 2Q, 3Q, 4Q rate of the
year. But definitely pleased with the result and, I would say, gave us the confidence to raise it here in the
first quarter, which is little. I don't think I can recall the last time we did that in my now 6 years in Digital,
but definitely pleased with the progress.

Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Is there a way to separate the effect of those things, the way some of your peers do?

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

I -- I'm sorry, is there a way to separate those things away from the...

Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

The impact of the 2 things, actual operational improvement versus FX in the guidance range, the way
some of your peers do. So you can actually tell what's guiding what.

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

We used to have a constant currency disclosure at the bottom here. I'm not sure -- I don't think we have
that anymore. I mean I would ballpark the $0.075, maybe $0.03 from FX.

Operator

Our next question will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Niknam
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

First, maybe on bookings. Can you talk about some of the strengths seen in Asia Pac and what drove
the uptick in bookings during the quarter? And then just maybe a little bit more of a housekeeping item.
Margins in the quarter were pretty solid. I think they were the highest since you closed the Interxion deal,
but we also saw tenant reimbursements pick up. And so I'm just wondering what was behind the pickup in
utilities reimbursements. Was that tied to the winter storm in Texas? And then maybe what drove some of
the offsetting cost benefits that helped drive EBITDA margins as high as they were.

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Matt. So maybe I'll try to take in reverse order, and I'm going to, I think, probably bring in Corey
here when we circle back to APAC. But just to the housekeeping piece. A little bit of a funky quarter on the
margin front. So I've guided to, call it, to our full year guidance table on the EBITDA margin. We do have

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

a footprint across Texas, Dallas being the largest piece of that. We were impacted by the winter storm.
Again, our operational team did a really marvelous job keeping up and running and customers happy.
Literally got a -- personally got a cold call from a CTO of a global customer who also had their own asset
or data center in the market and needed diesel fuel rerouted to them in order to stay running. And our
operations team sprung into action within like an hour's notice and kind of really saved that CTO's day.

But -- so on the power front. Power did increase unusually given what the storm. Luckily, one, our team
did a nice job hedging in terms of our power cost. Two, while it inflates the expense, it also inflates the
reimbursement because we have a sizable portion of our Dallas or Texas footprint is metered power, so
reimbursed. So net-net, especially on the size of company, not really a major negative, but certainly funky
when you got that spike in power when you look at your EBITDA margins coming through.

In terms of APAC, I mean, I'll turn it to Corey over here, but I mean just really standout quarter across
the full customer product spectrum. We're now live with, I believe, 5 or almost 6 colo projects across our
platform from Seoul to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and I'm missing one. So we have great success selling
into those markets.

And then also on the hyperscale or larger footprint front, I mentioned in the prepared remarks 1 top CSP
signed with us, both in Osaka and Melbourne. We also had subsequent in the quarter an anchor customer
in Inzai in Tokyo. And then Singapore, maybe I'll let Corey kind of talk to some of the success we saw in
Singapore.

Corey Dyer
Chief Revenue Officer

Yes, Andy, I would just add. You hit most of the data points I was thinking through in the response.
Really broad-based success across the portfolio is what I would say. AP was really successful as well.
You mentioned it in your prepared remarks, diversified e-commerce, customer that's been doing a lot of
business with us, and we really are happy with that.

But I would also tell you that our new logos coming out of that region has tripled in the last year. We're
really happy with the team. It's where most of our organic growth as far as the sales team that we're
putting out there in place. So we're really happy with it.

But I wouldn't get focused just on AP. I'd think about the broad-based platform success we're having
across all the regions. I think our largest export region this last quarter was EMEA. So we're really excited
about just kind of broad-based successful we are, and we think there's a ton of opportunity in Asia Pacific.
And yes, in Singapore, we were pretty successful selling through that large building there that we have.

Andy, was there any other data point I missed? I think we hit most of them for him.

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

No, I think you got it. Thanks.

Operator

Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel.

Erik Peter Rasmussen
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Looking at your table, it looks like Europe seemed to have sort of taken a breather this quarter with
leasing down and especially in the greater than 1-megawatt category. Has anything changed there? I
mean I know you talked about a pretty robust pipeline, but maybe some commentary around that just to
understand where the opportunities are and what drove this decline and if there's anything else you can
comment on.

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

Thanks, Erik. So I mean, really, Europe or EMEA just really came off of a blowout quarter the quarter
prior. I still think I was pretty impressed with the results and about a really healthy quarter. On the
larger footprint side, we had 4 different CSPs sign across 3 different markets: Frankfurt, 2 in Zurich, 1
in Amsterdam, so definitely pleased with the diversity of demand and from a customer and a geography
standpoint. On the enterprise customer standpoint, within the FLAP, Frankfurt, London and Amsterdam,
certainly stood out this quarter in terms of new signings. And within the non-FLAP, Marseille, Stockholm
and Madrid were some of our top EMEA markets.

So I -- and as you can see on our development table, we've been continuing to increase our footprint of
development and building out larger parcels in EMEA on our highly connected campuses there. So I don't
-- I'm still pretty really positive about the growth in Europe.

Erik Peter Rasmussen
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then maybe just on the re-leasing spreads, the greater than 1 megawatt. How does that
11.3% decline on a cash basis, how does that compare on a historical basis? I know this is all dependent
on customers and mix and there's a few other things. But how -- can you talk about that 11.3% in the
context of what you've seen in the past?

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

That's just a statistic when you slice it down to a quarterly basis and depending on what mix actually gets
renewed in that quarter because it's not just what actually expires. Customers will renew quarters or even
years earlier sometimes. In particular, there was 2 specific customers, 1 top 5 CSP, another enterprise
customer that did, call it, fairly chunky renewals in combination with new signings. The CSP was a multi-
market renewal, multi-market growth. The enterprise was in 1 particular North American market. So we
thought it was a very fair commercial compromise and love to see them continue to grow with us.

I don't -- I mean that bounces around, and we've had worse than that in a given quarter, and we've had
much better than that in a given quarter. And I still -- as you saw, we confirm that guidance on the mark
to market. So we don't think that's a truly bad omen or anything like that. And as I mentioned, I think
in response to Jon Atkins' question on the front part of the call, definitely feel like we're moving towards
better and better territory and expirations based on the product mix and the geography.

Operator

Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.

Ahmed Sami Badri
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I want to go back to Slide #10 and also back to the 11.3% that we're looking at for the greater than 1
megawatt. Now I guess if we go back to about a year ago, you guys are working through a very large
vintage of leases. And we were kind of -- we were informed that it would be high single-digit or double-
digit negative roll down there. But are we pretty much done with the majority of those leases? Or could we
expect a bit more negative rates, at least at this magnitude in other quarters in 2021?

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, Sami. Kind of consistent with my response to Erik's question, being able to predict with accuracy
the quarterly blend to that precision is pretty challenging because it's really out of our control when the
customer inks a renewal. But I think I would agree with your outset statement, we started out 2020 with
an outlook of net high -- call it mid- to high single-digit negative cash mark to markets overall. And as we
worked our way through that year, we outperformed that expectation. It ended up negative, but it was
very slightly modestly negative. And then we went to guidance. Our guidance, again, was really in that
same territory of where it ended up, so a better outlook than the prior year.

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 29, 2021

If you look at the overall results here, negative 2%, cash mark to market across all the products, it's kind
of right in line. Even overall, it's kind of -- it's kind of right in line with the language we've described here.
So again, I can't promise you every single quarter is going to be positive. But I do believe, based on our
understanding of the expirations of the contracts and the supply/demand market dynamics, that we're
heading into better territory on those mark to markets.

Ahmed Sami Badri
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. The other thing is on the 0 to 1 megawatt range for the 1.6%. In that 0 to 1 megawatt and in those
re-leasing spreads, could you give us an idea on customer mix in there in terms of how much of that is
enterprise versus cloud versus other?

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. In that 0 to 1 megawatt, the -- some of the chunkier deals were -- and these are in kind of no
particular order. In the New York Metro area, there was a fiber-oriented customer and also a content-
oriented customer. In London, there was a top 5 cloud service provider. In Singapore, there was a
multinational financial services company. In Northern Virginia, there was a add marketplace type business.

Operator

Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays.

Brendan James Lynch
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

This is Brendan Lynch on for Tim. Your slide deck indicates you've announced commitments to reduce
direct emissions by 68% and indirect emissions by 24% by 2030. Can you -- first, I've seen those
numbers or any specific targets announced. Can you provide some color on your execution strategy
around that and what it means in practical terms for your operations?

Arthur William Stein
CEO & Director

Sure. This is Bill. We -- as you noted, we've established carbon reduction targets in conjunction with
the Science Based Targets initiative. And in connection with that, we've committed to reducing direct
emissions by 68% by 2030 and committed to reducing indirect emissions by 24% by 2030.

As you also are probably aware, we are the -- we lead the data center category and the REIT industry and
green bond issuance. We've issued $5.6 billion of green bonds since 2015. We also lead the data center
industry in green building certifications. We have 796 megawatts of green building certifications. And
we also have 556 megawatts of renewable energy that's contracted, which, of course, contributes to the
direct emissions reduction. And that includes 154 megawatts in 2 renewable projects in Texas.

For the second year in a row, we've been voted the ENERGY STAR Partner of the year. And for the fourth
consecutive year, We've been voted Nareit Leader in the Light Award for the data center category, and
Nareit's only had that Leader in the Light Award for data centers for 4 years. So we're batting 1,000 right
now.

Brendan James Lynch
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Yes, that's great color. And clearly, you're making some progress there. How does that affect your
negotiations to the extent that it does with customers? And how are they responding to these initiatives?

customers' long-term goals are in this area.

Operator

Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi.

Michael Ian Rollins
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Looking at the rent schedule, it looks like about 35% of the rent comes from 1 megawatt and below
business. And I'm just curious, given all the comments that you shared on the call today in terms of
the financial performance of these rents, is it a strategic priority within digital to continue to lift this
percentage of mix that comes from the 1 megawatt or below leases?

Andrew P. Power
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Mike. I mean maybe Corey and I can tag team this for a second. I mean our strategy is to be
the leading global provider dedicated to the full customer spectrum from the service providers, all of the
hyperscalers to the enterprise customer. I think we've certainly demonstrated a pretty solid and consistent
track record on the first leg of that stool with your, call it, top 5 CSP having 20, 25, 30 different locations
with us on average, depending on the specific name. And that value prop of our land and expand and
future-proof their runway for growth, that operational expertise to the highest demands. Certainly proud
of that, and you've seen the success in our results.

But I think going after and supporting the enterprise is a place we've been investing in just as much over
the last several years on a multifaceted front, certainly in terms of the critical pieces of the business we've
acquired, putting the puzzle pieces together of the right most connectivity rich destinations, but also on
many of the things both Chris and Corey have been, call it, driving here for digital for some time. So I'll let
them speak to that a little bit as well.

Corey Dyer
Chief Revenue Officer

Yes. Thanks, Andy. Tying on to that. You think through just the tools we were talking earlier and about
how we use data to [ up the target ]. So we're moving that forward as well down that path, if you're
asking about kind of how we're going after the market, if we're going after that part of the business.

As far as the demand that we have going forward -- I'm sorry if I missed some of the question, but I think
it was a sales funnel question as opposed to just how we were targeting it. Did I get it all? I'm hearing
background noise. Sorry, guys.

Michael, can you repeat the second part of the question? I just want to make sure I'm getting it right.

Michael Ian Rollins
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Yes. So the question is just how much of a strategic priority is it for digital to increase the revenue
contribution from the 1 megawatt and below business.

Corey Dyer
Chief Revenue Officer

Yes, I'm sorry. I've got it. Yes.

Just given the financial nature and performance of this type of business versus the larger scale business
that you have.

Corey Dyer
Chief Revenue Officer

I guess I would tell you that we're going to try to increase both of them. We're not going to win every
customer without discerning between them. But our plan is to continue to grow the enterprise and
drive that. I think that will move that mix a little bit naturally, but it's not going to be at the expense of
the CSPs. We're going to go continue to partner with CSPs, continue to partner with online customers,
anybody that's in e-commerce, AI, some of the high-performance computing. So we're going to continue
to grow it everywhere as long as it adds to the value of PlatformDIGITAL and is helpful for us. So I
just don't want you to think that we're only trying to raise one without the other. We're going to try to
raise that enterprise business maybe faster than others to help us with that mix, but we're going to win
everything.

Operator

That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'd like to now to turn the call back over to CEO, Bill Stein,
for his closing remarks. Bill, please go ahead.

Arthur William Stein
CEO & Director

Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as
outlined here on the last page of our presentation.

One, we understand our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders, and we were
honored to be named the EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for the second year in a row.

Two, we continued to enhance the value of our global platform, culling noncore assets and extending
connectivity solutions.

Three, we delivered very solid current period financial results, beating expectations and raising our full
year outlook.

Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising attractively priced long-term debt,
recycling capital and using proceeds to hire -- to retire high coupon debt and preferred equity.

Our hearts go out to all those impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. And as we approach a post-
pandemic environment here in the United States, I'd like to once again thank the Digital Realty frontline
team members in critical data center facility roles who have kept the digital world running. I hope all of
you stay safe and healthy, and we hope to see many of you in person again later this year. Thank you.
