Presentation

Operator

Greetings and welcome to the Federal Realty Investment Trust Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Mike Ennes, Senior Vice President. Thank you. You may
begin.

Michael Ennes
Senior Vice President of Mixed-Use Initiatives & Corporate Communications

Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call.

Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker and Melissa Solis.
They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.

A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated
events or results.

Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based
on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ
materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that
these expectations can be attained.

The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report
filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk
factors that may affect our financial condition and results of our operations.

We've also posted on the website a slide deck that has more detailed information on the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on our business to date and various actions we've taken in response to COVID-19.
These documents are available on our website.

[Operator Instructions]

And with that, I will turn the call over to Dan G. to begin our discussion of our second quarter results.
Dan?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We're going to change things up for this quarter's call, and
I will kick things off before handing it off to Don. There's a first for everything.

I will take you through the results for the quarter with an initial focus on the major impact facing Federal
and every company in the retail sector: collectibility of rental income and the reserves we are taking due
to the impact of COVID-19.

Our approach at Federal to collectibility and revenue recognition has historically and consistently been
more conservative than the balance of the retail sector. To provide clarity on that point, let me refer you
to our most recent 10-Q, which includes our disclosed policies around revenue recognition and accounts
receivable on Pages 8 and 9. And I'm reading, "When collection of substantially all lease payments
during the lease term is not considered probable, total lease revenue is limited to the lesser of revenue
recognized under accrual accounting or cash received. If leases currently classified as probable are

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

subsequently reclassified as not probable, any outstanding lease receivables, including straight-line rent
receivables, would be written off with a corresponding decrease in rental income."

Now what that means from a practical perspective is when we move a tenant from accrual accounting
to cash accounting, we do not view the rent owed to us as necessarily uncollectible. It just means that
the probability of collection of the contractual revenues under the entire term of the lease is below the
threshold of what we deem as probable. We will continue to fight to collect every penny of rent due
from that particular tenant for that particular space. It is simply, based on our judgment, a decision to
recognize revenue for those tenants when the cash is actually received in accordance with the relevant
accounting standard as opposed to recognizing the revenue on an accrual basis when the cash is yet to be
received.

So for the second quarter, our FFO of $0.77 per share was meaningfully impacted by a collectibility
adjustment for the quarter of $55.2 million or $0.73 per share. This collectibility adjustment can be broken
down into 2 components. The first component, $45.8 million for uncollected rents from tenants that, one,
we already have on a cash basis, primarily most of our restaurants; and two, tenants that we switched
from accrual to cash accounting over the course of the second quarter due to the impact of COVID-19 on
their business. The majority of that second group is comprised of tenants in the fitness and entertainment
categories but also includes tenants who declared bankruptcy during the quarter or others we deemed to
be below the probable threshold. Additionally, there was a $9.4 million write-off of the straight-line rent
receivable essentially associated with tenants in that second group I just mentioned.

Other drivers which impacted the quarter include $0.08 of drag due to the impact of COVID-19 on our
hotel joint ventures, parking revenues and percentage rent and $0.07 of drag due to the higher interest
expense given the incremental liquidity and balance sheet strength we are carrying during the pandemic.
This was offset by $0.05 of positives from lower expenses at both the property and corporate level.

As a result, including the collectibility adjustments, this totals a net $0.83 of COVID-19 related impacts for
the quarter.

I'm going to stop here and hand the reins over to Don for his remarks. I will be back, however, to close
things out before Q&A.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everybody. I certainly hope all of you and your families are doing well
on these crazy times. And I do hope that Dan's remarks were helpful in understanding the accounting
conventions that we applied this quarter on a tenant-by-tenant and a category-by-category basis as well
as the in-depth and detailed supplemental statistical disclosures that we made in our 8-K on our website.
As Dan said, you just have to keep in mind that no matter what the accounting, nothing changes with
respect to the vigor that we'll go after the rent that's due to us by right.

I don't envy the jobs of the investment analyst community in parsing through the many judgmental
decisions that every company needs to make about their future income stream during this pandemic.
Frankly, it all comes down to the estimated probability of a tenant being able and willing to honor its lease
commitment over its remaining term, which often spans 5, 7, even 10 years. I mean think about that:
making the judgment today that it is probable that a fitness tenant, big or small, will fulfill its obligations
for the next 10 years, probable, 75%, 80%. That's a high bar. Obviously, those judgments are made with
the best information available today, which as you all know, could not be more cloudy at this stage of the
pandemic.

But what I want to talk to you about this morning is the future, on what we see happening today and what
we're betting on happening tomorrow.

And let's start with liquidity and reiterate what we said on the May call and at the NAREIT investor
conference in June. We remain confident in our ability to weather this pandemic and come out the other
side an even stronger and further differentiating company. That is the key premise to every decision we're
making.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

We project having approximately $1.3 billion in cash and unused credit line available to us 6 months from
now on February 1, 2021, even when -- and assuming that the declaration and payment of our next 2 full
quarterly dividends which could be declared in August and November and paid in October and January;
even assuming the continued and unabated construction at the partially completed projects at Santana
West, Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and CocoWalk; even assuming the collection of rents only marginally
better than the 76% plus that we collected in the last month of July; and assuming no asset sales or
equity issuance during that period, with all of those assumptions, we still wind up with $1.3 billion worth
of cash on February 1, 2021. And obviously, we're going to look at these and other ways to improve on
that liquidity position in the second half of this year. But the point is simply that we have great flexibility
even if we can't.

So let me move to our construction in process, where the completed lease-up timing of the office portion
of the large mixed-use development is less clear than the retail or residential components because
of the pandemic. While the 375,000 square foot Santana West office building is in the early stages of
construction and won't be ready for occupation until 2022, the 212,000 square foot Pike & Rose office
building is nearly complete today. 40,000 square feet will serve as Federal Realty's new headquarters
beginning next Monday, and benefits adviser OneDigital took most of another floor with a lease signed in
March as did a couple of smaller tenants. We still have 150,000 feet to be leased there. And in Assembly
Row, where Puma will anchor that 275,000 square foot office building beginning in late 2021, 125,000
square feet remains to be leased.

The long-term impacts of the pandemic's work from home mandates have created uncertainty in office
leasing, and so timing is hard to predict. Yet having said that, it's our view it's the best and most desirable
product on the market.

All 3 of these buildings are state-of-the-art new construction with enhanced clean air systems in affluent
suburban communities close to job centers and, most importantly, are integrated into the fully amenitized
mixed-use environments that business leaders say is essential.

And by the way, during this incredibly uncertain time, we signed nearly 100,000 square feet of new and
renewed office deals in the second quarter. That's in addition to the 277,000 feet of retail deals that I'll
talk about in a bit. Okay. Where? Well, at Willow Lawn Shopping Center in Richmond, where security
company SimpliSafe took all of the 58,000 feet of available office space that Virginia Commonwealth
University previously vacated at 28% more rent; at CocoWalk, where our office component is now 84%
leased with the latest signing for 13,000 square feet by Florida law firm Weinberg, Wheeler, Hudgins at pro
forma rents; and at Bethesda Row, where our comprehensive retail amenity base assures a historically low
office turnover rate in that community for us.

Basically, we think that our office offerings, all of which are an integral part of our mixed-use communities,
have been and will be the product of choice among business leaders on the other side of this pandemic.

So what else gives us the confidence to continue to operate as we have. Frankly, it all comes down to our
conviction, not only that first ring -- in that first-ring suburban location of our real estate, the sweet spot,
in our view, but also in the dominant, open-air, heavily amenitized product type and environments that
we've created in these locations over the last decade or more.

Consider that during the most disruptive quarter in this country's history, we still signed 47 leases for
277,000 square feet of space for 11% more rent than the previous tenant was paying in the same space.
And 3 of those deals were for strong-credit grocers at really well-located non-grocery-anchored shopping
centers: Lidl for Stein Mart at 29th Place in Charlottesville, Virginia; Whole Foods for Bed Bath & Beyond
and buybuy Baby at Huntington Shopping center in Long Island; and a third great-credit grocer for Barnes
& Noble at Willow Grove in suburban Philly.

Consider further that there have been 15 notable Chapter 11 bankruptcies filings between April and
July of the pandemic that have affected us. They are J.Crew; Neiman Marcus; True Religion; Creative
Hairdressers, its Hair Cuttery and related brands; Tuesday Morning; Le Pain Quotidien; 24 Hour Fitness;
GNC; Chuck E. Cheese; Lucky; Brooks Brothers; Sur La Table; Muji; Ascena; and Tailored Brands' Men's
Wearhouse. Combined, they represent nearly 650,000 square feet of space and 110 locations. Yet only

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

110,000 square feet and 28 of those locations have been identified by those firms for closure on their
initial list. That means that 83% of that square footage and 75% of those stores are, at this point,
expected to remain open by those merchants on the other side of bankruptcy. Heck, of the 11 J.Crew
concepts that we have in our portfolio, none we're on the closure list. None.

Now who knows how that all ultimately turns out and under what terms, but it sure is a pretty strong
indicator of the obvious desirability of our real estate.

Since then, Lord & Taylor filed. And as many of you know, it occupies the east side of our Bala Cynwyd
Shopping Center in suburban Philadelphia. Getting this store back unlocks one of the best 6-acre future
development sites in our entire portfolio.

And future desirability of retail space is really the most permanent question that needs to be asked and
analyzed today. Demand simply has to exceed supply to create value in this business, and yet we entered
this country -- crisis as a country in an over-retailed position, and we're definitely exacerbating that
oversupplied position because of the pandemic.

Obviously, not everybody can come out a winner here. Vacancy is going up, and I expect it to peak in the
first half of next year. We're likely to be in the 80s by then. And yet of all the things that worry me as a
result of this pandemic, and there are plenty, filling that space with great retailers and restaurants at good
economics is not one of them.

I know that our properties' positioning in those first-ring suburbs of major metropolitan areas will be more
desirable post COVID. I know that the decades of focus on creating comfortable and attractive open-air
places at those centers will further enhance their desirability.

Consider that nearly every discussion we've had or are having with brokers and prospective tenants in
every major market we do business in the prospective deal is premised around the tenant improving their
real estate locations, improving not only the location but their cotenancies, improving their environment
and, most importantly in some respects, improving their landlord.

Tenants want to be with landlords that have money, investable financial wherewithal, vision, execution
prowess and a pedigree of partnership with them. Long-term customer-friendly service improvements like
a coordinated customer pickup program matter today. They matter a lot. All of these considerations are
more important now and will certainly be on the other side of this than ever before, and we're set up for
it.

So that's all I have for my prepared remarks. Let me turn it back over to Dan for some final remarks, and
we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that.

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Don. Just jumping back into details from the quarter. With respect to our tenant activity across
the portfolio, we made great progress in light of the fact that most of markets in which we operate, we're
the first to shut down and effectively the last to begin reopening. Due to this fact, the percentage of
tenants that were open as a percentage of ABR was only 47% at May 1 and 54% at June 1.

As reopenings accelerated in June and July, as of July 31, 92% of our retail tenants are now open. As a
result, our cash collection has shown strong momentum tracking those reopenings. Cash collection for the
second quarter finished at 68% as we made continued progress with our tenants on unpaid rent.

Collected rent for April ended up at 65%, up from 53%, at May 1; May was 66%, up from 54%, at June 1;
and June was 72% for a blended collection rate of 68% for the quarter.

July collections further accelerated to stand at 76% at July 31, and August collections are off to a
promising start.

While only 1 day of collections, August 1, 2020 collections were roughly 85% of August 1, 2019 levels and
were 60% higher than July 1, 2020 levels.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Of the 32% of uncollected rent for the second quarter, roughly $68 million, our $46 million collectibility
adjustment accounted for 2/3 of that amount.

With respect to executed deferral agreements, we've taken a very tactical approach. With a portfolio of
only roughly 100 properties, we are able to treat every negotiation on a tenant-by-tenant and a space-by-
space basis.

$21 million of rent have been deferred for the second quarter under executed agreements with our
tenants. This represents 31% of uncollected second quarter rent and 10% of total billed 2Q rent. Of that
amount, almost 2/3 or $13 million is with accrual-based or probable tenants. And negotiations continue.

As we did last quarter, we have provided new and additional disclosure relating to the impact of
COVID-19. A summary of collectibility and accounts receivable is provided on Page 10 of our 8-K financial
supplement, and a new investor presentation which incorporates an update for COVID-19 can be found for
a link on our investor website.

Now just to revisit the balance sheet and liquidity. During last quarter's call in May, we had just closed on
a $400 million unsecured term loan with a 1-year maturity and a 1-year extension option into 2022. This
provides us with pro forma liquidity of 1.4 -- this provided us with a pro forma liquidity of $1.4 billion in
cash on hand and available credit capacity at that moment.

Following the May call, we immediately raised an additional $700 million in the bond market in 2 tranches
with 7-plus years of blended maturity and a 3.3% effective yield. As a result, at June 30, we have almost
$2 billion in liquidity with $980 million of available cash and an undrawn $1 billion credit facility.

We remain well positioned to manage through the challenging environment we currently face like we have
done time and time again over our 58-year history.

Deleveraging the balance sheet will continue to be a priority as we look to opportunistically issue equity as
well as sell assets and/or raise joint venture capital, leveraging the quality of our best-in-class asset base.

As you saw yesterday, our Board made the decision to declare a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share
payable on October 15.

Given decades of maintaining a fortress balance sheet and having the ability to build significant liquidity --
a significant liquidity position and having -- even in the most challenging of capital markets, we felt it was
appropriate to lean into this strength and capital position and declare a modestly increased dividend this
quarter and extend our increasing annual dividend record for a consecutive 53rd year.

Given our high margins at the property level, cash collections and store openings showing great
momentum and collections comfortably in excess of our breakeven collection levels, coupled with the
quality and productivity of current leasing discussions with our tenants and the implicit demand for
our real estate that, that provides, all drive -- drove the confidence and the strength of our portfolio
performance coming out of this environment.

As a result, based on the information we have today, we believe we should be able to support an
annualized $4.24 dividend from adjusted FFO on an ongoing basis post COVID. However, as we stated
previously, that perspective could change in the coming quarters as the length and the ultimate impact
of the pandemic on our business and our tenants' business become more visible. And know that the
management team and our Board of Directors will be extremely disciplined in setting our dividend policy
moving forward.
And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

My question, I'm just wondering what Federal can do in the short term to increase traffic and sort
of remove the caution from shoppers. It seems like your centers were places that people wanted to
congregate, and now you have to fight against that. I'm just wondering in terms of new services, anything
structural, marketing that you can do to get people to be more comfortable to shop in your centers.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

I'll tell you, Craig, and I appreciate that question a lot because if you could be around our centers,
certainly the mixed-use centers and even the more lifestyle-y other centers that we have, you would
be blown away by the traffic. And because they are open air, because they are part of the community
in which people already are living in and, frankly, because of the markets that we're in, you see masks
everywhere. People being extremely diligent with what they're doing. And specifically in the markets
that we're in, which were closed first and opened up really very recently, in terms of that, what I'm most
thrilled about is their comfort with our places.

Now we are also, I think, very early in throw -- putting out almost completely across the portfolio the
pickup, which allowed for a landlord-coordinated effort for tenants to effectively -- or for consumers to
pick up goods from merchants. That landlord-coordinated piece goes right to the heart of your question.
That's what's necessary.

And I can tell you, no matter how much it's being used or not being used based on any particular shopping
center, you know what really helps? It really helps prospective tenants because those tenants say this
landlord gives a c*** and is in it with us. And that notion of partnership throughout this, I honestly think,
is going to be one of the most critical parts of who wins, if you will, on the other side of this. And that's
what we're executing on.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Great. And then just on -- maybe on the longer-term focus, what are some of the tenants you would like
to add that are new to the merchandise mix that you have at your centers?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Well, that's a TBD. One of the things that I think -- as you kind of think about longer-term here -- and
I made a point about the tenants who were really struggling and the fact that they want to stay in our
centers, generally. And that's the case. And in the short term, we're going to want them to stay in our
centers.

Well, failing tenants are not who we want over the long term to create value in our shopping centers.
We do want to see who emerges here. And I can't give you specific names. If I gave you specific names,
it would sound very much like the lifestyle type of tenants that -- the Warbys of the world that we've
been talking about in the past. It's not about that. It's about over the next year or 2, the opportunistic
money that gets behind new concepts or reinvigorates old concepts that choose the best real estate in the
marketplace. That's what we're seeing, Craig.

The conversations that Wendy Seher or that Berkes and Sweetnam on the West Coast or Stu Biel here
on the East Coast are having are all about how do we get better real estate and who's going to be in

there with us and what do you guys do to make this all work together. Frankly, they're playing right to our
strengths. And so the combination of all those things, not one piece of it, is what in our view gives us the
confidence that we will be a more differentiated company, not less differentiated on the other side of this.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Santos with Piper Sandler.

Daniel Santos
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

My first one is on the dividend. How does the increased dividend align with taxable income for the year?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

So it is -- I'll let Melissa add to this or Dan to add this if they want. But the notion, and I'd like you to think
about this first, is our dividend, okay -- this was the last dividend for 2020 that counts in taxable income
for 2020. Our November dividend will be paid in January. So that will be the first one for 2021. And that's
a little bit different than other companies. So I want to give you that perspective.

Certainly, with respect, therefore, to the roughly $320 million of dividends that were paid this year, the --
fiscal 2020, that is in excess by something like $40 million of our taxable income and what that would be,
okay?

Now first of all, it's August 5, and a lot has to happen between now and the end of the year from a taxable
income perspective. Some of it could be a surprising good, some of it surprising bad, but we've got a lot of
flexibility there.

So did we pay more than we had to pay in 2020? Sure, we did. And the reason for that -- and I'm glad
you asked because I really want to get into this a little bit -- is that we built this company to be able to
power through recessions. And when I say the company, not just the balance sheet, the quality of the
assets, the diversity of the real estate. This is a recession, albeit a very unusual one. I got it. We went into
this with one of the lowest payout ratios -- dividend payout ratios going in. So certainly, we can pay it.

Then you've got to ask, well, why would we pay it if we don't have to? And at the end of the day, it's all
about our belief in the outlook and where we're going. It's all about our belief in effectively not only being
able to -- getting back to not paying more than we have to as we did in 2020 but, more importantly,
growing and creating value. And so there is -- I would have to be a whole lot more pessimistic about the
future than I am today for us to have cut that dividend.

And everybody always says they're long term in focus. Let me tell you, we're long term in focus. We know
what has to happen on the other side of this. And so sorry to be a little long-winded about that, Dan, but
I'm pretty darn passionate about this company's ability to come out of this crisis really strong.

So that's why. And it's a little more than your taxable income question, but it all ties together.

Daniel Santos
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

I appreciate the answer, the passionate answer. My second question is I was wondering if you could give
some color on leasing demand and phase of reopening in some of your traditional suburban shopping
centers versus your more sort of infill assets.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Let me give you 2 people. Let's have Wendy talk about that for more of our traditional shopping
centers and Berkes maybe on the West Coast in terms of some of the street retail stuff, the mixed-use
stuff.

Wendy A. Seher
Executive VP & Eastern Region President

Thank you, Dan. As I look at our -- kind of our pipeline that we have going, I look at a couple of different
things. And one of the things we're focused on obviously is what are the deals that were pre-COVID that
we still have that are now picking up momentum, and we see them coming to fruition to executed leases.
So that seems very strong. What I'm also looking at, and this is what I'm encouraged by, is that we have a
lot more deals in the pipeline and deals going to lease negotiations that were during COVID and now post
COVID. So that makes me feel very good about our pipeline.

And when I look at the diversity of the deals and the properties that we have, specifically on the East
Coast, it's fairly distributed well between our traditional grocery anchors to our lifestyle, to our mixed-use.

Jeffrey S. Berkes
EVP & President of Western Region

Yes. And Dan, I'd echo that out here on the West Coast. I'm very impressed by kind of how tenants have
behaved since getting through April and May when a lot of them were really trying to figure out where
their business was headed. It seemed like a little bit of a corner was turned in June, and the volume of
serious discussions picked up. And activity on LOI and lease negotiations picked up. As Wendy said, we
have a pretty robust pipeline of those discussions and negotiations going on right now.

And it is broad-based, not only in our more traditional community centers but also in our mixed-use
and lifestyle properties. And what we're seeing in the latter really is 2 things: one, continued interest to
expand their fleet within our portfolio from tenants that we've done deals with before as well as a lot of
new conversations from tenants that don't have a lot of legacy issues but understand that, if they are
going to open a handful of stores, opening them in the best possible locations is critical. And discussions
with those tenants in both groups have picked up and are progressing well over the last couple of months.

So too soon to tell, obviously, if all the deals that are in the pipeline get done. I'm sure a few will drop
out, but we're pretty impressed with the discussion so far. And hopefully, that shows up in the results in a
couple of quarters.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

I want to add one thing to both of those comments. I don't want you -- and maybe I'll throw a little cold
water on it. I don't want you to think we are Pollyannaish and don't understand the severity of what's
going on in the country. Of course, we do. Of course, we don't have great predictability of when things
turn and really what that means. Obviously, the timing of the vaccine, all the stuff that -- obviously, we
don't know.

So all we can do is make business decisions today based on what it is that we know. And I'm -- all that
Wendy's conversation and Jeff's conversation and ours has been about is we see a path. We see a path
forward. We know what to do to try to be able to execute to get there. There's enough raw material that
suggests that there's a good probability that, that can happen.

Again, who knows? But today, which is why you see the results you see in the second quarter, you
bookkeep based on what you know today, and then you work for tomorrow.

Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

I'm sorry, just getting myself off mute. I wanted to follow-up on that a little bit, the last question by Daniel
here. I wanted to get a bit more color on the conversations with the tenants you're having today, how they
compare pre -- versus pre-pandemic from a demand, willingness to sign deals and deal terms perspective?

And then what are you hearing in these conversations with tenants if they make space decisions? Are they
seeking value? Are they more biased to the location, the first ranked suburbs that you talked about, asset
type? What are the things that seem to matter most as they think about spacing in a post-COVID world?

Wendy A. Seher
Executive VP & Eastern Region President

I think that what we're hearing a lot of is that retailers -- some retailers are going to make fewer new
openings, right? So they're going to make short, they're going to make decisions based on, in my view, a
criteria that has just doubled.

So they -- and every box is going to have to be checked. So when we are thinking about -- so when
they're thinking about would they -- do they need to be in strong centers that have great landlords that
invest in their properties that have co-tenants that are -- meet who their customers are and then where
they can ensure the ability to do stronger sales. That is going to be a must. And with that criteria, we feel
like we're very well positioned because of the ability to have strong occupancy, strong sales and a landlord
that has a strong balance sheet that's going to continue to invest and look towards the future.

So that has been sort of the -- we're not having as many discussions as I would like to have, but the ones
that we are, they want to upgrade their real estate.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Are you getting the sense that you're losing any leases due to price to rent or perhaps there's a search for
value that may be making certain tenants more inclined to seek secondary locations as they think about
the costs that are involved?

Wendy A. Seher
Executive VP & Eastern Region President

It's a good question. I think based on what I had -- what we just talked about, which is that it's so
important that these locations come out strong, that what we've seen is that tenants are willing to pay
more to have that insurance that they need, that the location that they either relocate or they open hits
the gates strong right from opening. So we found that they will pay more to be in the right locations.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Imagine this, Haendel, just think about this for a second, right? If you're looking to do deals right now,
you're certainly looking for value, right, for deals, that's, frankly, not much different than it's ever been.

But the big thing that Wendy's talking about that's so critical is you don't really know who your cotenancy
is going to be. You really don't know today if you're getting a cheap deal who you're going to be doing
business next to? What that shopping center is going to feel like. And look, there is a big risk to signing
for any mini -- for any anchor or even mini anchor. A 15-year deal, when you don't have that visibility,
the additional rent to be in the dominant centers seems to pale in comparison to the sales being able to
underwrite what you think you're going to do in business.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Got it. And my second question is on the leasing spreads. So I sort of looked back, indicator -- a lagging
indicator, you have 10% of maybe...

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Yes. The question is on the leasing spreads. The new leasing spreads have been consistently in the 10%
range here. I'm curious if your view is that would -- clearly, it's a lagging indicator, but what bottoms first,
occupancy or new leasing spreads?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

I don't know. I think they kind of go together. With us at least, and we're certainly a smaller company than
some of the big guys in terms of GLA.

And so a few deals make those leasing spreads be what they are. And so you'll see volatility in that. The
strength in the second quarter was a couple of deals and the single biggest one was taking very old Bed
Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY space at Huntington, which is a great shopping center in terms of location
and trading up for Whole foods at a big rent. So I mean that moved the needle in this quarter. Hopefully,
every quarter, there is a few of those. Sometimes there are, sometimes there's not.

But I -- what we're working hard to do is to maintain occupancy, and that does mean we'll defer or abate
or change contracts more readily, certainly on the restaurant side. The idea of a restaurant, where you're
going to defer your money, and they're going to have to pay it back next year, I mean that's a fool's
errand in most situations, except for a large, well-capitalized company, right? I mean, if you were running
a restaurant, would you take your last few hundred thousand dollars of savings and try to open back
up only to know you're going to pay it all to your landlord in next year? No. I mean, there has to be a
realization, an honesty about assessing the current situation and then know that you'll make your money
with that occupancy with the deals that give you a chance to make it back and with new deals because
tenants are looking at well-occupied shopping centers. That's our MO in terms of how we're approaching
this.

So you're certainly going to see lower vacancy -- or higher vacancy, rather, a lower number there. And
you're certainly going to see pressure on rents in certain places. But overall, you got to feel really good
about the demand drivers of a portfolio like this.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi.

Christine Mary McElroy Tulloch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Don, just a follow-up on those comments. You talked about your willingness to defer or abate and the
potential pressure on rents. If I think about the categories where you're seeing those below 50% collection
levels, and you talked about them: fitness, experiential, restaurants, full-price apparel. These categories
comprise a good portion of your write-off. How should we think about sort of the rent levels that many of
those tenants can now pay given their reduced revenues, right? Like it seems like a lot of these problems
aren't going away until we have a vaccine. How do collections rebound for their tenants without some sort
of reset to their rent levels, currently, right? Is it a matter of just releasing that space? Or is it working
with them to get to the right rent level, given that restaurants and experiential are part of what makes
your centers what they are today.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

No question about it, Christy. It's interesting. I'm going to start with the more obvious ones.

Restaurants are not so obvious. Restaurants, I'm pretty darn positive, feel pretty good about frankly, in
terms of not only their importance to our centers, but their ability to generate business and pay us rent
on a percentage basis, it will be a number of them going forward. But again, in our places, I think we can
make money that way.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

I do think the harder ones, our theaters and fitness centers. I do think that. And the reason I think that, in
fact, I'm actually going to take a little tangent as you expect me to, Christy. But everybody keeps saying
our second quarter was conservative. Even Dan said in his remarks, we're conservative.

I got to tell you, I don't see it that way. And let me tell you why. I mean, first of all, the punch in the gut
ought to be book kept in the period that it's been incurred. That's the second quarter. And so if you sit
there and say today that theaters or fitness operators have figured out what their business plan is on the
other side of this and what rent they can pay us, I would tell you, really? To your point, I'm not sure what
a movie theater's ability to pay the rents that are in place or a fitness center's ability to pay the rents that
are in place over the next decade, which is what you're being asked to say in accounting by straight-lining
that stuff. I don't think you can. I don't think that's conservative. I think that's realism. And so sitting and
saying, okay, that piece of our income, which is a few percent, right? I don't know what theaters and...

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Fitness is 4%, Experiential is 2%.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

So there's 6% there that I agree with you. We do not have the visibility. Restaurants are so different in
terms of each one of them, what they are, what their owners' financial position looks like, what they're
willing to do, et cetera, and frankly, so critical to how the entire works that we are absolutely working with
those important restaurants. And we identified this on March 18 that, that was going to be a critical group
for us to effectively go. So those are more individual answers to your questions. I'm sorry to tell you that
I'm not sure of the answer on the theaters and on fitness. But I think that's an only honest answer that's
possible today.

Christine Mary McElroy Tulloch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And then, Dan, you talked about the drag associated with the liquidity that you're maintaining right
now given the gut raises that you did last quarter. Don, you talked about the $1.3 billion in cash or the
importance of having that liquidity by February. I know that you don't know what will happen, right, with
collections and occupancy. But as long that plays out sort of over the next 6, 12 and longer months. How
do you think about the balance sheet management aspect of that on a go-forward basis and maintaining
that level of liquidity?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Look, I think we've spent years and years building the credibility we have, that I think it's evident
that we were able to on -- in the midst of all the uncertainty of early May and was able to raise the capital
that we did over $1 billion from our banks. And so our access to capital continues.

I think that we will, like we've done in the past, show balance. And I think we are going to be
opportunistic with regards to keeping leverage kind of in line with kind of our long-term goals, our long-
term metrics yet. Yes, our metrics are going to be impacted. Our net debt-to-EBITDA will go up.

Our coverage ratios will go down as we work through over the next few quarters. But we will be
opportunistic, whether it be through asset sales or joint venture capital or even issuing equity when we
see opportunities in the market. We will keep a diversified source of -- the spectrum of capital sources
available to us. And as we work through it, we'll avail ourselves to kind of the -- all of those sources as we
move forward.

But our intention is to kind of take advantage of the market as it's available, while keeping our long-term
focus on our leverage profile in line with historic levels.

President, CEO & Director

I'll say one more thing to you, Christy, on this. You know that a very long-term problem that we always
have to deal with is with asset sales, is covering tax gain. And we have to 1031 everything, and it's hard.
And the idea of looking at that as a potential source of a piece of our capital is on the table for us right
now, which I think is an interesting additional tool in the toolbox that we didn't have as easily before.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors.

Vince James Tibone
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Can you discuss a little more details as what types of joint venture structures could you see most probable
the source of capital? I mean, I'm trying to get at is almost how would you weigh selling an interest in an
individual component of one of the big 3 projects, where maybe you can get stronger pricing today than
retail, versus having interest aligned in an entire mixed use property?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Vince, I don't know. That's a hard one to answer because it depends on a specific deal and a specific
circumstance. I mean, you know how much -- I think you know how strongly I believe in the integration of
those uses at our -- at the big mixed use properties. It's important now, is that different for a stand-alone
office building across the street from Santana Row? Maybe, right? I mean, it's just -- it's not as integrated
as the office buildings that have retail under them and are part of it. So we could look at that differently,
for example. I'm not saying we will, not saying we are, but that's -- I'm trying to give you the level of
detail and the considerations that have to be thought through. Because there's not a direct answer to your
JV question.

I would really have a hard time at Assembly Row effectively selling off an office building or a residential
building, that was part and parcel of our product -- project. I would much rather, if it came to you needed
to look at it, we would look at it as a passive partner that bought a percentage of the whole thing.

So it depends. I don't know, JB, if you want to add anything more to that. That's kind of how I see it
though.

Jeffrey S. Berkes
EVP & President of Western Region

Yes. I don't think there's too much to add. Vince, one other thing, obviously, would be looking at a
portfolio of our more stable, slower growth, non mixed-use assets, and does it make sense to bring
somebody into that in some sort of way.

All things we're thinking about, like Don said, nothing really to talk about at this juncture and haven't
made any decisions or, quite frankly, any real progress other than kicking it around internally here.

Vince James Tibone
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

And then shifting gears a little bit. I'm curious, has the lease dynamic of leasing negotiated -- negotiations
shifted at all in recent months with e-commerce getting another leg up with COVID. How much do 4-wall
-- 4-wall occupancy cost ratios matter anymore, given the benefits of having a brick-and-mortar store and
online sales?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

You're right on it, man, and I've been preaching on this for a while. I mean, does 4-wall occupancy cost
matter? Of course, it matters. Does it matter as to the level that it used to in a lot of businesses? No. And

so when you sit and think about it, all the stuff that Wendy talked about earlier on this call, and Jeff talked
about earlier on this call, in terms of the considerations of what makes a business profitable, obviously,
including the online business, the ability to pick up goods in the store. I'm telling you, man, this notion
of what we're doing with respect to the pickup, and having a tenant or -- sorry, a landlord-coordinated
effort here is really big, and it's big in what you're asking about, and that is what are the tenants asking
about in lease negotiations? What are the differentiators that matter? We always knew it was the location,
obviously.

But more and more, it's about the co-tenancy, it's about those other services, it's about that tenant being
comfortable that the landlord is working part and parcel with them to make them successful, in total, for
their businesses. It's a more holistic approach.

Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

This is Greg McGinniss. I'm with Nick. I just had a few questions on the tenant bankruptcies. And I
understand the expectation is for the majority of those stores to remain open. I'm just curious with total
exposure to those 15 bankrupt tenancies and if they've all been taken to a cash basis. And then also
curious on how much of an impact those tenants had on Q2 collectibility.

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Roughly the exposure, it's total exposure to all 15 names that we had on that list was roughly in the,
call it, the 3%, a little over 3% of our total revenues. So not a huge number. All of the tenants on that list
have been taken to cash basis with the exception of one because it just happened right at the end and
that's Men's Wearhouse or Tailored Brands.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

And then what was the impact on the collectibility for Q2 from those tenants?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

We don't know right here. We'll get back to you.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then, I guess, just a follow-up question on kind of the restaurants. And Don, I appreciate
comments you gave that you can't really predict the percent rent trends. But I believe that you previously
mentioned abating rents for your best restaurants, I think it was the top 60, if I recall correctly. We were
just wondering how that abatement program may have evolved since you last spoke about it, what that
impact was in Q2 and if all those tenants are on a percent rent basis now.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

No. Certainly, not all those tenants are on a percentage trend basis. That's still a -- that's still the
exception rather than the rule, Greg. I don't have a number for you all the way through here. I -- as you
correctly point out, the 60 tenants, the 60 restaurants that we had identified initially as critical to the
property, we worked with early. That has continued and grown through the portfolio as it -- as in certain of
the situations, it's useless. And so we're not working with them. We're simply holding the line and trying
to get paid contractually with whatever they've got left because they're not going to make it. So it really
gets down to a -- on a one-by-one basis. And next time you can travel and we can move around, let me

walk you through a Pike & Rose or Bethesda Row or Santana Row certainly and kind of just show you the
broader issue in terms of how this stuff works. I know you're trying to put numbers in a model and make
percentages work and somehow tied to something in the second quarter that I could care less about any
longer. But nonetheless, the real key is kind of understanding how those deals are going to financially
work going forward. Got it? And more importantly, what they're going to do for other tenants in that
shopping center going forward.

I don't know, Dan, if you've got anything specific for his question.

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. No, I think you answered that. Just to get back to your previous question, roughly of the $55 million
adjustment, roughly about 10%, $5 million or $6 million, was associated with the bankrupt tenant.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I guess where tenants haven't paid rent and you don't have deferral agreements in place, what portion are
you in back-and-forth discussions with versus really having no clarity on a resolution?

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Well, I think, yes, call it, 30% of our unpaid rent, we have deferral agreements with. We probably
have another 20% kind of in conversations. And handshake agreements on -- even more with that.

So we're making progress. Negotiations are ongoing. We're trying to be really, really tactical and strategic
with regards to those conversations. And so it's a bit of a moving target. But we feel good about the
progress we're making in kind of resolving some of the unpaid rent and coming up with solutions. And in
some situations, we're kind of viewing it as, hey, look, you have a contract, you need to pay it. And so
we'll fight that out. But that's, I think, in process at the moment, Mike.

Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And out of curiosity, how is parking and hotel income been trending in the third quarter
compared to the second?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Yes, that's a good question. I don't know the answer to that. The -- might the hotels -- the 2 hotels were
closed for most of the second quarter, obviously, have opened up now are still trending at something like
20% occupancy, 30% like or so occupancy. So certainly not making any money, that's for sure.

And parking revenue, interestingly, is coming back and put -- and I'm using that based on what I know
and visually see at Pike & Rose, at Santana Row, at Bethesda Row, et cetera, because the traffic is up.

So back to where it was? Of course not. But trending in the right direction.

So in regards to the 21% of the reserves that you took, I'm sure there's quite a different varying range of
that -- of meaning that 75% threshold or not. What percent do you think, roughly, were tenants that were
already living on the ledge or kind of in structural decline pre-COVID, that no matter how many deferrals
you give, probably won't come out of it okay. And I guess what the remaining bucket of tenants that were
probably pretty good were not paying rent for a few months, really helps them, and they can come out of
it okay.

Daniel Guglielmone
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Well, I don't think we have answers -- specific answers where we bifurcated kind of into those kind of
buckets? Yes, sure. There's a bunch that won't make it. There's a bunch that we think we can work with
to get them through it, but I don't have a percentage, specific percentage of what fall into each of those
buckets. I think...

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

But Ki Bin, I mean the bottom line is, this was from the beginning. We are not negotiating with tenants
that we don't believe will make it.

Right, if we don't think -- we're looking at our best chance for success. And sometimes the best chance is
to simply default the tenant, pay or quit, try to evict. I mean sometimes, those are the best answers. And
so we're using -- generally, when you're talking about a tenant, the 15 tenants that filed bankruptcy, there
wasn't one surprise on those 15 tenants that filed for bankruptcy. So we didn't sit there and abate or defer
rent with those tenants in any meaningful way. Why? Because it wouldn't help with respect to what they're
going to do. And the same applies to smaller tenants.

So I -- obviously, I don't know the percentage differences, but I can tell you philosophically how we
approach each of these -- each of those guys. So I don't know if that's helpful to or not.

Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

And how would you describe how apartment operators are behaving around your markets? Because
you can be very disciplined, you have great assets and you have a great operating platform. But if the
surrounding private operators aren't behaving kind of rationally and undercutting rents or getting more
TIs, some things are out of your control. So how do you think about that?

Wendy A. Seher

Are you talking about the small shop tenants and how they're behaving?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

No, no, no. The other shops [ under occupancy ] that are run by private owners.

Wendy A. Seher
Executive VP & Eastern Region President

Oh, that's right. Yes. I think as we get post-COVID, we've always been -- we were under -- over-retailed
before. And we are definitely going to be more over-retailed now. So there's going to be a lot of low-cost
options out there. But again, as to my prior point, I think you'll have a very small subset of tenants that
just go for a low-cost option. And that majority of the tenants who really need to be opening stores that
are productive and robust in terms of sales are going to the critical factors of creating that successful
operation is going to be what we have to offer in terms of occupancy, in terms of co-tenancy, in terms of
convenience, in terms of the location and are investing in the property.

The one thing I would say to you. I'm sorry, man. The one thing I would say to you, Ki Bin, as you know,
it's hard to imagine from my perspective that, that has not been priced in the stock. We're all 40%,
right, from 6 months ago. And if you go -- if you look going forward, will there be rent pressures? Of
course there will be rent pressures. We're a 40%. Do you think these properties are worth 40% less than
they were 6 months ago, with a $1 billion assembly row be sold for $600 million today because of those
concerns? Not at all. It's been over it's been over -- I get it. I understand the uncertainty and why. But I
kind of think that's priced in even if there is and there will be pricing pressure from lower cost operators
going forward.

amount of fitness and second floor -- other second floor space that we've already taken out and created a
high-value office in is pretty interesting, certainly at Santana.

And with respect to the ability to have properties that now, with more vacancy, can be turned into
residential and retail, more of a mixed use properties. We look at that stuff that way.

So it very much depends on the property, but we can do all those things.

Our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Boenning and Scattergood.

Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Actually, Compass Point. But just wanted to -- one question, I guess. On the -- some of the opportunities
that you're going to get as a result of bankruptcies. And you mentioned this, Don, I think earlier in your
comments about the Lord & Taylor at Bala Cynwyd. How will you balance the incremental capital spend
that will require with the potential to create value and to grow your NOI going forward? Do you think
about that differently today than you would 6 months ago?

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Yes. That's a very good question, Floris. I mean look, the uncertainty of capital means that the bar is
higher. You happened to pick one in Lord & Taylor at Bala where, I mean, I've been dying to do something
on that piece of land for the better part of 15 years there. It's just an underutilized, great piece of land.
Now what COVID just did was made Lower Merion Township more important than Lower Merion Township
was pre COVID. So I'm -- so the answer is always going to start with the real estate. It's always going to
start with the ability to create value on that real estate. That's an easier one.

For some of them that are less easier, yes, they have a higher hurdle that they've got to fight for. But for
us, it's not only that initial ability to redevelop. It's what is it that we see from the long-term growth. And
I think -- I know you're familiar with Darien. I think you'll see what we're doing at Darien and has been
enhanced by COVID, not hurt by COVID because of where we are. So I think we'd start with a leg up on
that stuff.

Our final question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

On the restaurant front, certainly, I hope Lebanese Taverna is one of the restaurants that survives. That
place is great.

So Don, just a question on the dividend, how you think about it. In answering a bunch of the questions,
there's obviously a lot of unknown. You guys are -- have a lot of capital that you want to spend on projects
like Merion or like Darien, places that you think will really reward investors.

So the decision to increase the dividend, was that based more on just the strength of Federal's balance
sheet or the real-time improvements that you're seeing? Or is it just your general belief that there will
be a vaccine that 2021 will be a much better year, and therefore, don't look at this year and what's
happening, look forward. And with all that said, you guys feel comfortable that you can maintain that
above-taxable income payout?

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 06, 2020

Well, let's -- first of all, Alex, I'm so glad you got a question in as the last question because I was worried
for this call. I was missing you greatly. So it's good to talk you.

With respect to -- and I don't have an answer on Lebanese Taverna exactly yet, except we've gotten 2
new concepts from them that just opened. So that's good.

Getting that aside. I kind of -- I've spent a lot of time on the dividend because it's not just 1 or 2 or 3
things. It really is the myriad of everything. And so when the question came down about capital raising a
little bit earlier, and Dan was answering what -- how we look at the balance sheet going forward and how
we're going to effectively finance, there is -- I'd be lying to you if I didn't say to you that we have a level
of confidence in our ability to raise money from as -- from a wide variety of sources, whether that's equity
or debt or joint ventures or asset sales or whatever because that all comes not only from our history of
being able to do that, but they -- at the end of the day, the conviction that this real estate is the best real
estate out there is just real. So we're going to have, in our view, more opportunities than most to be able
to raise capital. That's an important component of what's happening here.

Also, there's no doubt, as I talked about, at the property level, if you were with us and you were working
at Federal and you were meeting, as I do, with Wendy every day or every other day at the least, and with
Jeff and with Jan, you would have a good hands on sense for the desirability of that real estate and the
deals that are coming through and can come through to -- on a long-term basis to be able to get that
done. And that would give you another level of confidence.

So there will be equity raises on the other side of this. This company has effectively been built to be able
to provide an equity investor a return that comes from appreciation as well as a dividend. And it's a critical
component to it, in our estimation, for the type of investors that we want, because those are long-term
investors. And so the combination of those and 5 or 6 or 7 other things suggest to us that at this point in
time, we should continue the dividend.

Now the raise, the $3 million incremental cost that it cost us by going up $0.01, that's everything. That's
the record, right? I mean, gosh, if we're going to pay $80 million, the notion of -- and then -- and ruining
the record, we shouldn't do that. So the incremental $3 million, that's based on our history. But that's it.
It's the $3 million that's in terms of the raise. The actual payment is on everything I was talking about
previously.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then the second question, Don. Next to The Point in El Segundo, BXP announced a JV for that
triangle. Was that something that you had considered that maybe would be a good -- something that
you would consider? I don't know if you were involved in that at all, but was that something that you
guys ever looked at or given everything else that was on your plate, you're like, look, it's across the train
tracks. It's -- or separated, whatever, and it just -- we have more that we don't need to get involved in
that.

Donald C. Wood
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a real complicated one, and Jeff is on the phone, he can certainly answer, but we've talked about
that. I've discussed the point, I don't know, at least half a dozen times with Berkes, and we've sit there
and he said, "How are we going to figure out what to do on that?" And every time we looked at it, the
costs and moving tracks and time and all that is just of more than we want.

Jeffrey S. Berkes
EVP & President of Western Region

Yes. Actually, just to weigh in quickly, Don and Alex, it's on the air product site, which is just east of The
Point on Rosecrans...

Oh, yes.

Jeffrey S. Berkes
EVP & President of Western Region

Where all the tanks used to be when we originally opened The Point. So we've talked a lot to Continental
Development about doing stuff with them. That project, when it's built, and they're not ready to build it
yet given what's going on in the market, but when it's built will integrate very nicely with The Point. And
actually, we think, drive a lot of daytime demand for our restaurants and shops and services at The Point.
So we're happy to see them do it.

But it is 100% office, and I think there is, and I alluded to a little bit in the release, say, longer term,
bigger view, from both of those parties on how they work together, that we just didn't really fit into.

So great relationship with them, great developer, really happy to see what they're doing, but just not -- no
fit for Federal.

Operator

We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike
Ennes for any closing remarks.

Michael Ennes
Senior Vice President of Mixed-Use Initiatives & Corporate Communications
