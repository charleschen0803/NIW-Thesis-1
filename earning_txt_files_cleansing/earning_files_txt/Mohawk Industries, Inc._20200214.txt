Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Lisa, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Mohawk Industries Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, February 14,
2020. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Huelskamp. You may begin your conference.

Kenneth Huelskamp
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Mohawk Industries quarterly investors
conference call. Today, we'll update you on the company's results for the fourth quarter of 2019 and the
full year as well as provide guidance for the first quarter of this year.

I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may
include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth in our
press release and the periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This call may include a discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP
amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and the press release in the Investors section of our website.

The key speakers today are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Wellborn, Chief
Operating Officer; and Glenn Landau, Chief Financial Officer.

I will now turn the call over to Jeff for his opening remarks. Jeff?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Ken. Our fourth quarter adjusted results were as we expected, with sales flat to last year,
operating income of $205 million or 8.4% of sales and EPS of $2.25. For the year, our sales were $10
billion, adjusted operating income was $938 million or 9.4% of sales and EPS was $10.04.

Our cash generation remains strong with operating and free cash flow for the quarter of about $440
million and $300 million. For the year, operating and free cash flow were about $1.4 billion and $870
million.

Our leverage is approaching historical lows, which provides us the flexibility to pursue additional
opportunities. In the period, we bought back approximately $23 million of stock for a total of $375 million
since authorized. We anticipated our business -- as we anticipated, our business remained challenged by
soft demand, greater competition and reduced production volume.

In the U.S., markets continue to be influenced by the strong dollar and the impact of LVT on other product
categories. Consumer confidence remains high, and lower U.S. interest rates are positively influencing
new and existing home sales. U.S. tariffs on applicable LVT from China were ascended in the fourth
quarter, and market pricing has declined for these products. Imports of ceramic tile from China dropped
off substantially in the fourth quarter, and shipments from other countries have not offset, which we
believe is due to soft demand and a reduction in U.S. ceramic inventories.

Competition has increased in our global markets, impacting our pricing and mix as we leverage higher
investments in sales and marketing to drive growth. Many countries where we operate are stimulating
their economies with lower interest rates to encourage greater consumer spending and economic growth
this year. In the near term, we still anticipate continued pressure in our markets and product categories.

Throughout the period, we implemented changes to increase sales and reduce costs. We've enhanced our
LVT manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe, and realigned our U.S. carpet operations. We have decreased

our ceramic production and inventories and are taking out our wood flooring plant in the United States
and in Europe. We are reducing the complexity of our operations, improving processes to reduce costs and
increasing automation to improve efficiencies.

We continue to improve the productivity and volume of our new LVT, U.S. countertop, Russian sheet vinyl
and European carpet tile investments. Our acquisitions in Australia and Brazil are installing state-of-the-
art equipment that will expand their product portfolios. We're introducing new design and performance
innovations to enhance our market position and broaden our customer base. To promote both new and
existing products, we're making higher levels of sales and marketing investments.

For a review of our financial performance during the period, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Moving right into our financial performance and year-over-
year bridges. As Jeff shared, in the fourth quarter, total company net sales were $2.4 billion, down 1%
compared to prior year as reported and off approximately 2% on a constant basis, which we define as
adjusted for FX and days. For the full year 2019, total company net sales were flat compared to 2018 as
reported and up 2% on a constant basis. Organic growth in the legacy businesses was down 3% in the
fourth quarter versus prior year on a constant basis and down 2% for the full year compared to 2018, also
on a constant basis.

In terms of earnings, the company's adjusted operating income was $205 million in the fourth quarter or
8.4%, off 140 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year, largely due to weaker volume and price
mix, only partially offset by improved productivity, including lower start-up costs. With that said, the
company's year-over-year decline in margins improved on a sequential basis by 100 basis points, which
now represents 4 consecutive quarters of improvement.

Bridging from the prior year fourth quarter, adjusted operating earnings were impacted by: number one,
lower overall volume of $10 million, largely in our global ceramic and flooring North America segments
and associated market-related downtime costs of $4 million, all taken in global ceramics to match our
supply with our demand; number two, a modest increase in inflation of $3 million due to higher wages
and benefits, partially offset by lower raw materials; number three, an erosion of price/mix of $24 million,
largely in our flooring rest of the world segment following easing input costs and $11 million higher
spending in SG&A and other due to investments in sales talent and marketing to drive sales.

Moving to the positive offset. Productivity including lower start-up costs swung positive by $16 million
versus last year due to better utilization and non-repeating onetime items. For the full year, adjusted
operating income was $938 million or 9.4% of sales, off 250 basis points from prior year.

Staying at the enterprise level, adjusted SG&A for net sales was 19.1% in the quarter, excluding unusual
items, up 180 basis points year-over-year due to higher sales, marketing and merchandising expenses
to roll out new products and to grow in new markets. Inflation, acquisition, lower volume and onetime
charges also impacted the quarter. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 18.4% of sales, up 100 basis
points year-over-year.

And just to be clear, relative to the rollback of tariffs on clickable LVT product from China, prior to tariffs,
we had already raised inventory significantly and have since reduced purchases in 2019 as we reduced
inventory and ramped up our U.S. production. We also have purchased from other countries in this period.
So the total gross rebate amounted to $13.5 million, which is in our guidance, spread over 3 quarters and
largely offset by inventory value on hand.

Special and unusual items in the fourth quarter consisted of a $50 million charge for restructuring and
integration costs, of which most was noncash and divided relatively evenly among completing U.S. carpet
realignment and rightsizing the company's wood manufacturing footprint in Flooring North America and
Flooring Rest of the World, as well as $136 million onetime tax benefit associated with the consolidation
of business activities in Europe within a single operating entity to improve management and increase
efficiencies, also reducing the company's tax rate somewhat in 2019. For the full year, total restructuring

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 14, 2020

and integration charges taken for actions in Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the World were
$111 million, of which approximately $41 million was cash. And as we have said, the cash cost associated
with carpet restructuring of approximately $30 million will be recovered as operational savings, as lower
cost pass-through inventory in the first half of this year, reaching full run rate in the third quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA was $363 million or 15% before interest expense of $11 million. For the full year,
adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion or 15.3%. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 18.9% in the
fourth quarter and 20.6% for the full year of '19.

Finally, adjusted net earnings per share was $2.25 in the quarter, down from $2.53 or 11% versus last
year. And for the full year, adjusted net earnings per share was $10.04, down from $12.33 versus 2018.

Now let me turn to the segments, and I'm only going to speak to the fourth quarter here. The Global
Ceramic segment delivered net sales of $858 million, flat versus prior year as reported or a decrease of
1.5% on a constant basis.

Looking at only at our legacy businesses, sales decreased approximately 4% on a constant basis.
Operating income on an adjusted basis was $54 million or 6.3% of net sales, down from a 10.1% margin
last year, primarily due to increased competition and weaker demand in the U.S., coupled with higher
inflation. So compared to last year at the segment level, inflation was $16 million higher, driven by higher
wages and materials and benefits. Volume was off $14 million, inclusive of $4 million of downtime. Sales,
marketing and other costs were up $5 million. Price/mix slipped $4 million, and this was all partially offset
by improved productivity and lower start-up costs of $6 million. FX in the quarter was neutral.

Let's move to Flooring North America. The business showed better overall performance with sales of $936
million, down 4% versus last year as reported and down 5% on a constant basis as continued weakness
in soft surfaces were partially offset by continued growth in LVT. Operating income on an adjusted basis
was $69 million or 7.4% of net sales in the fourth quarter. Bridging from last year, volume was down
$17 million versus last year and accounted for the majority of the deficit. Price/mix lagged prior year by
approximately $6 million. Raw material cost decreases offset increases in wages and benefits, keeping
inflation flat and productivity less reduced start-up costs was better by $6 million.

Moving to Flooring Rest of the World. The segment had a solid quarter with sales of $630 million, up 2.6%
versus last year as reported and 3.7% on a constant basis. Looking just at the legacy business, sales were
up 1.5% on a constant basis. Adjusted operating income came in at $89 million or 14.2% of sales in the
quarter, an increase of 140 basis points versus last year in a very competitive environment, mainly as a
result of increased volume.

Going to the bridge, volume was better by $18 million. Price/mix lift by $15 million, but was largely
offset by relief in overall inflation of $11 million driven by lower input costs. Productivity, including lower
start-up costs, was $3 million. And investments in sales, product, marketing and other were $6 million
higher in the quarter. FX was, again, neutral for the quarter. Finally, at the corporate level, expenses and
eliminations drove an operating loss of $8 million with a full year cost of $40 million.

Speaking now to the balance sheet. Receivables ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, with days sales
outstanding up due to changes in geographic and channel mix. Inventories ended the quarter at
approximately $2.3 billion or 134 days, higher in days versus prior year by approximately 6 days, but
relatively flat in dollars as we continue to adjust our production to match our sales.

Fixed assets for the quarter ended at $4.7 billion on capital expenditures of $140 million in the period,
lower than depreciation and amortization, which was $154 million. So for the full year, CapEx was at $545
million, lower than our D&A of $576 million as we efficiently managed our Q4 project spend in each of our
segments.

Total debt was $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, down approximately $200 million versus the third
quarter, with leverage declining 1.6 -- to 1.6x debt-to-adjusted EBITDA.

Wrapping up, the balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. With free cash flow of $300 million in the
quarter, totaling $873 million in 2019, capping off a very solid year in overall cash generation.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 14, 2020

So with that, Chris, I'll turn it over to you.

William Christopher Wellborn
President, COO & Director

Thanks, Glenn. In our Global Ceramic segment, most of our markets faced a combination of soft demand
and excess industry capacity that is compressing market prices and margins. During the quarter, our
U.S. ceramic business remained under pressure from LVT taking share and high industry inventories
from ceramic purchases ahead of tariffs. Additionally, to align our own inventory levels, we meaningfully
reduced production in our North American ceramic plants, which increased our costs. We have started
to see some trends that should benefit our business in 2020. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter,
total U.S. ceramic imports declined 17%, with Chinese ceramic imports falling 90%. Lower interest rates in
improving new and existing home sales should also benefit the market this year.

To improve our sales, we are rolling out multiple new products and adding sales representatives and
design consultants in major markets. Our new collections aimed at replacing imports are gaining
momentum. To increase productivity and reduce costs for our customers, we have streamlined ordering
processes and made picking up orders at our service centers faster and easier. We continue to enhance
our showrooms and galleries to better communicate the beauty and performance of our ceramic products.

During the fourth quarter, we initiated manufacturing of our new quick tile in multiple sizes and designs.
Our proprietary product has been tested in both residential and commercial applications and has received
positive reviews for faster and less expensive installation that is able to be walked on the same day.
We are launching click tile at our trade show this quarter and have already received commitments from
major customers. We are expanding our mosaic and wall tile offerings to meet growing demand for
these categories. Our quartz countertop sales continue to increase as we ramp up the productivity and
throughput at our new Tennessee plant. We're developing more sophisticated visuals to enhance our
manufactured quartz collections and improve our margins.

Sales of our large porcelain slabs from Europe are growing, and we are increasing the sales of Daltile-
branded LVT products. In Mexico, the economy continued to face headwinds due to uncertainty around
U.S. trade with the overall construction activity declining in the fourth quarter. We are gaining share by
expanding our brands, distribution and product offerings with larger sizes, porcelain products and more
comprehensive wall tile collection. We are increasing our participation in the commercial markets and
enlarging our base of stores that exclusively sell our products. Despite a soft economy in Brazil, we had
good sales growth during the period due to our strong brand and product offering. In December, we
initiated production on a new porcelain tile line that produces larger sizes to expand our premium offering.
To increase our sales in other South American countries, we are updating our showrooms and expanding
distribution.

The Southern European economies remain slow, impacting our primary ceramic markets and industry
pricing. In this environment, we increased our volume even as lagging consumer confidence reduced
demand in the larger retail remodeling channel. We are expanding our activities in the commercial
channels as well as outdoor products. To extend our style leadership, we are introducing new premium
products with the surface structures aligned with the printed design to create more realistic visuals. Our
medium priced products have enhanced our results with new sizes and visuals. Sales of our porcelain
slabs grew dramatically from a small base during 2019, with the products gaining greater utilization in
traditional areas as well as for countertops. We are increasing our inventories at our regional warehouses
in Poland, Greece and Romania to expand our customer base with faster local service. We continue to
specialize our plants by product type to optimize our cost and improve our competitive position.

In Russia, we grew our ceramic sales in a soft market. Our growth was driven by our unique business
model that includes the industry's most comprehensive premium offering, a national distribution network,
owned and franchised retail stores and the strongest project specification organization in the industry. To
further strengthen our position in 2020, we expect to expand the stores that exclusively sell our products
to more than 400 locations across the country. To support our growth, we are starting up additional
porcelain production to make super large sizes and a new plant to produce coordinated premium sanitary
ware.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 14, 2020

In our Flooring North America segment, we have executed many initiatives to align the business with the
present market conditions. We faced a challenging market with LVT growth continuing to impact sales of
other product categories. As expected, our pricing and mix remained under pressure as customers traded
down, and lower production levels raised the cost. Lower raw material costs during the period were offset
by a more competitive environment.

We streamlined our infrastructure by closing 3 plants, consolidating high-cost operations and reducing
wood manufacturing. The effects of these actions will increase and flow through the inventory with full
cost benefit in the third period. To reduce cost, we have implemented numerous process improvements,
executed machine modifications and increased our recycled polyester production. We are leveraging
automation and equipment advances to reduce comparable volumes with a smaller manufacturing
footprint.

In the period, our residential carpet sales performed best in the new home construction and multifamily
channels. Our new carpet introductions were well received at the national flooring trade show, and they
will be in the marketplace early 2020. We are leveraging our strengths in design and fiber technology to
deliver differentiated new collections in both premium and value categories.

In the luxury and super soft categories, we have extended our multi-color and pattern capabilities in
our proprietary SmartStrand silk collections. ColorMax, Mohawk's exclusive color blending technology,
is rapidly growing in the marketplace with its natural pallet that coordinates with wood and stone looks.
We've increased our recycled polyester fiber capacity to expand our participation in the fastest-growing
carpet category.

In commercial, we are coordinating the colors and stylings of our carpet and LVT collections to enhance
the design options. We have introduced award-winning collections for schools and workplaces with nature-
based designs. To increase our focus by channel, we are expanding our commercial sales organization and
enhancing their skills. We continue to invest in new design capabilities, proprietary carpet tile backings
and a material manufacturing to create greater value for customers and improve our costs.

We have increased the production and speeds of our LVT operations, and ongoing initiatives will further
improve formulations and throughput. We are now operating at similar speeds to our European LVT
operations. During the period, U.S. tariffs on click LVT were removed, and the market has adjusted pricing
to reflect this change.

To expand our price points and highlight our unique visuals and features, we are introducing new
collections for both the residential and commercial markets. Our expanded premium Pergo and Karastan
collections have been well received at trade shows due to their leading visuals and styling. The buyers
in China is postponing some production start-ups, and it could potentially disrupt some LVT service
depending on when shipments resume. Sales of our waterproof laminate products are expanding
across most channels, and we anticipate continued market growth due to their realistic appearance,
durability and ease of installation. The detailed visuals and performance features of our premium laminate
collections are increasingly being used as alternatives for both wood and LVT. To support higher laminate
sales, we are upgrading our HDF board production to increase capacity and reduce costs.

Our Flooring Rest of World segment continued to deliver strong results in the period. The segment's
business is less exposed to those European countries which are having more economic difficulties. Across
the segment, our investments in product innovation, cost improvements, acquisitions and new businesses
strengthen our results. We're outperforming the European laminate market with our focus on premium
products that are more realistic with unique features. Sales of our new laminate collection are ramping up
quickly due to an enhanced level of sophistication. In the period, we absorbed higher marketing costs to
support this introduction.

We announced the consolidation of our wood manufacturing to our facility in Malaysia, which will improve
our cost and flexibility to better service our customers. Our LVT sales grew as our new manufacturing
productivity significantly improved. To further enhance our plant performance, we are implementing
specific initiatives to improve throughput, material cost and waste. To utilize our growing capacity, we're
introducing new rigid collections that are being well received in the retail, DIY and commercial channels.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 14, 2020

We are expanding our LVT offering through our European distribution system to broaden our specialty
store penetration.

Our sheet vinyl sales increased primarily from strong growth in Russia. The Russian plant is operating well
and positively contributing to our results. Our European carpet tile business is expanding from a small
base by increasing our sales organization and introducing higher-value products to the market. Our panels
business continues to perform well as we introduce higher-value products to improve our mix. We are
increasing the use of recycled wood to benefit our cost and the environment. The expansion of our glue
plant is operating well and is contributing positively to our results. We are also installing a second waste-
to-energy plant to reduce our cost and increase recycling. This year, our insulation business had good
results with higher sales volume even as declining material costs considerably lowered market prices.

In Australia and New Zealand, we had good performance. We are launching many new carpet collections
in multiple fiber to enhance our residential offering. Our hard surface products had strong growth with LVT
outperforming. New carpet tile collections are being introduced to support our new commercial carpet tile
line that is being constructed.

With that, I'll return the call to you, Jeff.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Chris. Market conditions remained challenging across most of our businesses and geographies.
In response, we're adjusting our business strategies, enhancing our product offering and restructuring
operations. We're increasing our investments in sales and marketing, expanding our commercial
participation and enhancing both our premium and value collections. We are bringing new product
innovations and categories to the market that will broaden our distribution into new channels and
geographies. Our new LVT countertop sheet vinyl and carpet tile plants are improving their productivity
as we invest to expand our customer base and sales volume. Our LVT manufacturing capacity grows with
higher speed and efficiency. We are enhancing designs and features and increasing sales of our rigid and
flexible offering. We are limiting the traditional inventory build that we typically do in the first quarter as
we manage our production with market demand. Taking all this into account, our EPS guidance for the first
quarter of 2020 is $1.90 to $2, excluding any onetime charges.

LVT growth, exchange rate and excess global capacity continue as headwinds for our business. We are
executing specific initiatives to adapt to shifting consumer preferences, changing markets and competitive
pressure. For the full year of 2020, we expect that our actions to increase sales and distribution, reduce
costs and enhanced utilization of our new plants will deliver improved results year-over-year with
performance accelerating during the second half of the year. Our balance sheet should continue to improve
with ongoing cash generation, and we remain focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders.
We'll now be glad to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Your comment on LVT in Europe sounded pretty promising on the manufacturing front. So I'm just curious,
are you making money with that line yet? And with the success you're seeing on the manufacturing front
out there, are you still on track to breakeven in North America early 2020?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

In Europe, we have 3 lines. The 2 old ones are operating as we expect and are doing well. The third one
is not at the level we'd like it to, but it's improving, and we expect it to be profitable as we go through the
year, as well as the U.S. line.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Any more color in terms of the timing of the U.S. line in terms of getting profitable?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

It's going to happen during the year.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just one last one for me on the cash flow. Glenn, you were kind enough to give us free
cash flow guidance last year. Any color on how we should think about 2020, some of the big moving
pieces, whether it's working capital, CapEx? And then just given your balance sheet is in really good
shape, and cash flow still quite strong, are you guys open to buying back more stock?

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

Let me speak to the first part of that, and I'll just say that we had a great cash flow year, and we expect
cash flow to remain strong into next year, and the ability to improve our balance sheet is apparent.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

What about on buybacks?

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

On buybacks, Jeff?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

The buybacks, we have $125 million left. We'll continue buying against it, and we'll evaluate it when we
use it up.

And our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First question, I appreciate the kind of directional guidance for the year in terms of your outlook for
improved results with acceleration in the back half. I was curious as to what that assumes from a top line
perspective, either by segment or on a consolidated basis, but just trying to get a sense of how you're
thinking about sales growth for the year and if also there would be an acceleration in the back half there.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

I appreciate you like more detailed information, but we give quarter guidance, and we give you a
direction, but we don't detail the rest of it. And we're not going to do it now.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. I had to try, I guess, but I appreciate that. I guess, secondly, you've increased or you continue
to take action around some of the restructuring. And this is kind of an ongoing story as you continue to
adjust the conditions. You've heard about the consolidation of the carpet operations going back to the
first half of 2019. I think initially, the expectations were around some of those benefits coming through in
the back half of '19. And obviously as you shut those plants down, we would presume that there's some
amount of cost benefit on the onset. So just trying to understand how those costs are flowing through
or at least the cost savings are flowing through. You highlighted the fact that there's things that are in
inventory that continue to need to be worked through. But at the same time, I would have thought that
some of those cost benefits might have come even in the back half of 2019.

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

Well, like we said, Mike, really, we finished the carpet restructuring largely in the back half of 2019. And
due to the timing of implementation and the inventory flow-through of the costs. We're talking about a full
run rate impact in the third quarter. Yes, there's a slow ramp-up, but the full impact that's meaningful will
be closer to the start of the third quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

First question, Glenn, thanks for outlining the LVT rebates. I guess just asking more specifically, so I guess
it's $0.15 roughly in terms of benefits for the year, you said, spread over 3 quarters. How much is included
in the first quarter?

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

The first quarter is the lion's share, but it's over 3 quarters. Starting the...

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

It's offsetting the inventories. We have high inventories that you have with long supply chains, and so the
majority of it is going to offset the price decreases that we've already implemented. And as the inventory
flows through, they match up.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 14, 2020

It's in our guidance. It's spread over 3 quarters. And like I said and like Jeff is saying, it's largely offset by
the inventory value on hand.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And just the second question following up on that would be, just given the price
declines following the exclusions, you're saying it's offsetting the rebates in the first few quarters. But on
a go-forward basis, since the rebates kind of go away, the price declines, I guess, don't necessarily -- how
should we think about the net effect beyond the initial quarter or 2 where you have the offset from the
rebates?

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

I think the way we need to think about it is they're roughly offsetting.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

There's a large -- since we raised inventory prior to the tariffs, the inventory -- most of the inventory we
sold in the year came from old pieces, and we still have large inventories of what we've been purchasing
through the period. Is it -- and so it's offsetting that.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Right. I guess -- and sorry, just where I was going with that. If market pricing has reset lower, are you
saying that it's only impacting the legacy inventory? Or is this a go-forward impact from lower market
pricing as well?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

The market pricing has gone down on clickable LVT, and I don't see any reason it's going to change. And
the price of the products we're buying have gone down, too. So the prices in line with the new selling
prices and costs are aligned.

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

So to the extent we're buying it, it's pretty much offset.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of John Baugh from Stifel.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Two quick questions. One, do you have a rough guess on revenue or sales basis, what your market share
of the U.S. LVT market is?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Yes. But we haven't -- we don't give out specific details on product categories.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Would you have a guess, Jeff, to when you see out into the future reaching parity or any kind of
rough idea, time line?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

I don't understand the question.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Well, I presume your share of U.S. LVT sales is lower than your share sort of the flooring market in
general. So my question is, when would you see Mohawk in LVT, whether it's imported or made in the
U.S., sort of match up the shares of carpets, ceramic, laminate, all put together?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

It's continuing to increase, but I don't have a date when the 2 will match up.

John Allen Baugh
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Secondly, really quickly, you mentioned imports of ceramic from around the world into the U.S., but
down 17% in Q4. Could you just remind us sort of a normal typical year, how much import account as a
percentage of U.S. consumption?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Imports are a huge part of the ceramic market, maybe 70%, 75%. It's a huge part.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Speer from Zelman Associates.

Justin A. Speer
Zelman & Associates LLC

Just wanted to start, just get a sense from you because the removal of the click LVT tariff was -- is fairly
recent. But I think we understand the deflationary aspect of that in the near term. But how does that
affect demand for LVT? And what's your view for price and demand for the non-LVT categories in the
fourth quarter? And what's expected in the first quarter at a high level?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

There are no details of that available today. Our expectation -- our guess is that LVT has approximately
about a $3.5 billion part of the industry. It's growing. We think that the growth rate is slowing as the base
gets bigger as we go through. It's impacting the growth rate of the other products within it as you go
through. So I'm not sure we have the details that you're looking for.

Justin A. Speer
Zelman & Associates LLC

Okay. So I will just keep an eye on that. But I guess within your guidance as you unpack that, there's
obviously some conservatism around maybe production rates slowing. And then the other element is the
variable in SG&A investment. So SG&A was up about 9.5% in the fourth quarter, up 7% for the full year.
And I'm just trying to get a sense for what your SG&A investment will be in 2020, recognizing that you
have some cost tailwinds from restructuring efforts, but you're also investing in the business. So I'm just
trying to get a sense for how much SG&A will be up or down next year.

MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 14, 2020

Well, 2020 will be higher due to the full year impact of our investments. We do expect higher sales in the
second half, and that's the target of these investments. We'll evaluate as we go through the year, and we'll
adjust as necessary depending on the sales.

Justin A. Speer
Zelman & Associates LLC

Excellent. And the last question for me is just I didn't catch it, but on the ceramic tile bridge, what was the
price/mix? And what was the productivity and start-up cost elements of the bridge?

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, repeat the question?

Justin A. Speer
Zelman & Associates LLC

The bridge, the EBIT bridge that you gave, I didn't hear the price/mix or the productivity elements of the
ceramic tile.

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

On the ceramic side? So on ceramic, the price/mix was slipped by $4 million.

Justin A. Speer
Zelman & Associates LLC

Down by $4 million?

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

Price/mix slipped by $4 million and overall productivity and lower start-up costs offset that, that was $6
million.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Just one comment on the SG&A. In the U.S., we're expanding the commercial sales forces, we're building
markets for quartz countertops, roofing and LVT. In Europe, we're developing a new commercial sales
organization to sell LVT vinyl and carpet tile. We've invested in regional distributors, which we purchased
our distribution in different pieces, which all the costs go into SG&A but is offset by higher sales and
margins. In Russia, we've talked about increasing stores. So there's a lot of activities at which those are
only some of them.

Justin A. Speer
Zelman & Associates LLC

So these are growth investments? And just ultimately, you're -- so you're not pulling in the range, you're
digging in to invest to grow. And ultimately, you think that will really manifest itself in growth, better
growth in the second half. Above-market growth, do you think?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

I mean the markets, -- we're investing to expand the areas which we think we can expand, and we'll
monitor as we go through the year. And we also have all the new product categories, the new businesses.
You have to put the salespeople in before you get the sales for them and the marketing monies.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley from Barclays.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Can you just provide a little more color on the comment you made around the how the virus in China is
impacting the startup of LVT production? And how that's flowing to you guys? Because obviously, you're
ramping your own capacity. I guess the question is, how reliant is Mohawk on this start-up capacity in
China for your 2020 plans?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

The information is less than perfect at this point. They go on holiday for the new year, then the people
come back. So the people are not coming back at the rate they would normally come back. There are
some operations have started. Some are in partial things and up, and some haven't started at all. And the
question is, how is all that going to line up and when they're going to start? Nobody has a clear view of
what it's going to be. Given we have inventories in line, we can last a while before it has any impact on
the business, and we're having to moderate to see what's going to happen.

In our business, we do buy product from other countries that we manufacture ourselves. So it has less
impact on us than the rest of the industry, but the whole industry has the potential of slower service
depending upon what happens.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking of inflation and raw materials as we go
through the year. I know that you said it was a $3 million benefit as it related to the consolidated business
in the fourth quarter. But how are you thinking about that as we look to 2020?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

The raw material prices, in general, mostly the oil-related products have come down. At the same time,
there's more aggressive pricing in the marketplace, and we're assuming that the market prices are going
to continue to reflect the decreases mostly in the commodity categories, and we're going to continue to
participate in aggressive manner. We'll have to see how competition reacts. And some of the other places
we've had in Europe, for instance, we had prices on our insulation boards come down dramatically, but so
have the prices of the products in each. So we're assuming given the excess capacities in the world today
that the changes will be reflected in market prices.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just given all the moving parts with your various product rollouts and investments in SG&A and just how
the timing of these investments relate to your production ramp, when should we expect to see some

In the second half, we're expecting to see some benefits from the actions we're taking, and we'll keep
reevaluating them. And depending upon how the markets change, we'll continue to adjust.

$30 million you're targeting?

Glenn Rodney Landau

The $30 million of restructuring is more about cost.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

You're tying the restructuring piece with the marketing investments. They're separate.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Right. So I'm just trying to ask like when you should start to see some operating leverage on the SG&A
side?

We're expecting to see most -- more of the benefits about in the third quarter and the second half, we
keep saying.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Just a clarification. So SG&A is up and is expected to be up over the next few quarters as you're investing
to grow sales. But gross profit was actually up in Q4 for the first time in, I think, 6 or 7 quarters. So
should we expect that gross profit can actually grow a little bit and you're reinvesting that in SG&A now,
and that's really what's driving some of the year-over-year EBIT margin compression? Is that the right
way to look at it?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

You answer what he wants.

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

So I think we stated broadly, we expect 2020 to improve over this year, our overall results back-end
weighted to the second half, and that's broad-based. It's based on our initiatives and the pass-through of
the costs. So SG&A is a function of that. And ultimately, the trend should continue.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

On the cost side, we're expecting the restructuring pieces we've done to benefit. At the same time, the
increased volume through the new plants should reduce the cost and help the margins in those also.

ceramic?

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

Again, we've talked about that several times in ceramic, and that's really overseas. That is largely some
raw material, but energy costs that are driven by the Eastern European facilities and fixed government
pricing.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum

Yes, I think in Europe, we expect maybe a little relief on some of the energy increases this year.

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust.

Keith Brian Hughes
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Questions on North America ceramic in light of the falling imports you had identified. Does that -- I
guess, my question is, where does the channel inventory stand now? When do you think that will be more
balanced? I know it's been out of over inventory for some time.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Keith, we don't know -- we don't have the data to see the inventory exactly. What we know is that the
imports, which is a huge piece of the market, came down 17% in the quarter, and the imports from China
dropped off altogether. So we expect that it's a combination of inventories in the channel coming down
and softness in the market.

Keith Brian Hughes
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Is this still something that's going to affect the first half, I would assume, Chris?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

It's just hard to tell because all we can really see is the amount of inventory coming into the country, but
we don't have a sense yet exactly the size of the inventory in the channel.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet.

Michael Robert Wood
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

Just wanted to talk about that ceramics import data. If I look at it historically, it is down considerably
fourth quarter year-over-year, although it's still higher than the fourth quarter in '17 and '16. So I'm just
curious how you're looking at the level of imports and how you're thinking where it should be. I mean is
this a level -- a healthy amount of import activity currently that we can sustain?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

Well, what we believe is that as you got into 2019 and when the tariffs were announced on the Chinese
product prior to those going to effect, there was, we believe, a significant increase in pre-buys related
to that. In addition, as they replaced the Chinese inventory with other countries, you had a combination

of Chinese inventories in the system, plus new products that they were purchasing to replace it, which
elevated those inventories and sort of, we believe, gave a sort of a false view of how much the industry
was growing. We don't know exactly last year, but we think it probably declined 3% to 5% would be -- but
it's just a guess.

Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Question for me. The capacity that you all have coming online, previously, earlier last year, you said you
had about $1.2 billion coming online in 2019 and 2020. Could you just give us an update of how much is
coming online in 2020 and possibly 2021? Remind us which products and categories.

And then just one item for clarification. The LVT rebate, if I'm hearing you correctly, in the first quarter, it'll
probably be somewhere around maybe a $0.10 benefit to EPS.

Glenn Rodney Landau
Executive VP & CFO

Well, again, what we said is that's the total rebate, which will be largely offset by inventory and lower
pricing. So again, it's immaterial, but it's in the guidance.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then the capacity?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

The new plants are the different pieces. We have LVT, which is still ramping up. It will ramp up all through
this year.

We have the Russian sheet vinyl plant, which is running -- it's positively helping the business now, but it
still has -- it's only used about 30% of the capacity as we push it into the marketplace.

We have the carpet tile business, which we're developing an entire commercial sales organization, which
is also going to sell vinyl and LVT in Europe. So it's ramping up. It takes a while to develop the customers
and pieces.

We've put in new capacity in Brazil to put in higher-end products. And we have capacity in Eastern Europe
to make low-end ceramic which expands. Our market there is ramping up.

We have the quartz plant in the United States that's running about 3 shifts today, but it's building
inventory and also pushing it in. Over time, it will go to 4 shifts in the productivity and inventories. The
productivity and throughput will go up. And all of them, we have to get the mix aligned because you start
out selling more lower-quality products to get more volume through the plant, and it's going to take time
to develop those as we go through. So they're all working through the system at different rates.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Is that still about $1.2 billion that you're bringing online over the next couple of years?

Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.

Brian Biros
Thompson Research Group, LLC

This is actually Brian Biros on for Kathryn. I want to ask a follow-up on the coronavirus and I guess the
supply chain impact. TRG industry contacts are telling us that the supply chain has not really yet been
meaningfully impacted. But if the manufacturing stoppages are extended another 3 to 4 weeks, that could
impact then shipments about 3 to 5 months from now. I actually wanted to see if you guys think that logic
makes sense. And maybe any color on what you're hearing from manufacturers from either Vietnam or
South Korea, the impact to their supply chain.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

I think that's close to what we said. We said that right now, it's difficult to say how fast it's going to come
up, that there are huge inventories in the chain over different times, that it depends on each piece. So
typically, there's anywhere from 4 to 7 months of inventory through the channels and the stuff coming
through. And in that, you have some that have low parts and some that have high parts across the
industry. So depending upon what it is and each piece and how fast the part comes up, it depends on the
time. There could be people in the channel with less than that, and they could be impacted with a few
weeks' worth of delays.

The non-Chinese production in the surrounding countries, some of it or a significant part of it also uses
inputs coming out of China. So if the inputs don't come up, it could affect those also. So at this point, it's
really difficult to know what's going to happen and the impact -- it depends on the inventory levels of any
individual SKUs at this point. As most people, when they buy from there, there's the Chinese New Year
where they shut down, so you have the product that was bought in anticipation of that still flowing across
the water coming in. And so it still comes back to how fast it's going to pick up. And what the timing of the
new production is going to -- the production coming up, and nobody has any idea.

that product relative to Chinese competition? And how does that influence your ability to get close to full
capacity by the end of the year?

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum
Chairman & CEO

We think when it's fully optimized, that we'll be able to compete with the world marketplaces. At the same
time, our goal isn't to sell all commodity product. Our goal is to sell value-added products that have a
higher average mix, which will help -- which will allow us to meet the return goals that we want.

I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lorberbaum for closing remarks.

Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum

We're reacting to the market conditions. We see excess capacities in the market continuing, and we'll have
to continue to react to competition in the marketplaces as they evolve. There are a lot of indicators that
many of the markets around the world are expecting the economies to get better and improve. We have
a lot of -- a lot going on to increase the utilization of our new plants, which we think will help the second
half as the throughputs go up, which will allow the cost to come down and also the mix to improve over
time.
