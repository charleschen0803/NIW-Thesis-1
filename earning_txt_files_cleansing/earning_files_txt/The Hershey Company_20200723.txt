THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.

Christopher Robert Growe
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I hope you're all well. I just want to ask a question if I could. Just first of all, on -- as we're looking ahead
to the second half of the year, you did call the seasons to be less of a -- or not a material effect on the
performance of the business over that time. I'm curious, and you did have some discussion in your call
this morning about Halloween overall.

Can you tell, based on orders, how Halloween is shaping up at this point in time and the degree to which
that could have an effect on Q3 sales? And you also talked last quarter about having some early seasonal
sort of fall product coming out. How is that -- is that in the market already or going to the market soon?
And how could that play into your overall seasonal sales in Q3?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. So for Halloween, we do have orders from retailers. We start to get those orders way back in May.
In fact, we try and finalize the orders by the end of May and we have already shipped some product. The
way the season unrolls, we continue to ship product from -- really June through early October. So we have
pretty good visibility to those orders. Now it's always possible that orders could change in the coming
months, but that is not a very common occurrence.

I'd also remind you, as we listed in our comments. About half of our product for Halloween is purchased
for self-consumption. So that's really candy bowl, it's a celebratory kind of treat for the family. And then
that -- about 40% of it then falls into the back part of October, which are the trick or treat sales. So we
feel good based on what we've seen. We've been partnering closely with the retailers.

We feel good about many retailers wanting to kind of lean in. We also think that consumers will find
creative and safe ways to trick or treat. It is an outdoor event and it's an event where a lot of masks are
already worn. There's no evidence of the virus being passed through packaging or food. So we feel pretty
good based on what we're seeing so far from consumer feedback.

But if trick or treat tends to be a little lower than expectation, clearly, we'll focus even more on the treat-
for-me and the candy bowl occasion. So you already know that we shifted some of our portfolio to more
everyday packaging to protect the downside, should Halloween sales be a little bit lighter to really manage
that liability. So at this point in time, based on what we're seeing, we feel pretty good.

From a holiday perspective, we do have an early read on holiday. We have started producing products.
At this time, we don't really see seasonal participation being significantly impacted. And a lot of that is
due to the fact that many holiday occasions and consumption is actually at home. So we think that will be
less likely to be disrupted but obviously we will continue to monitor that closely, to work closely with our
retailers as we have with Halloween.

Christopher Robert Growe
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

That's great. And just one quick follow-up, if I could, which is in relation to retailer inventory levels. As you
ended the quarter, I just want to get a sense of where they were. Obviously you did undership demand in
the quarter. There's an expectation for an increase throughout the second half of the year. And I just want
to kind of tie it into that seasonal discussion. Is that a component of the expectation for higher inventories
in the second half of the year?

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So inventory was about a 1.5 to 2-point headwind on our first half growth, and there were really
a couple of factors that drove that. Part of it is, as you recall last year, we had a build of inventory as
retailers were perhaps anticipating a price increase. So the lap from that creates part of that.

Secondly, we were depleting inventory as a result of consumer stock ups and the acceleration that we
saw in takeaway across our portfolio. So we've been working really hard and have very strong customer
service levels versus the industry. But yet we've still been continuing to replenish to kind of catch-up with
that accelerated demand.

And then the third factor that really falls into that equation is nonmeasured channel softness. We've talked
to you about owned retail locations, world travel retail, the food service. Some of those businesses that
don't show up and measured happen to be the same ones where we have some of the greatest softness.
So the Halloween piece is not really a factor in that inventory piece. It is much more around the everyday
businesses and the nonmeasured channel.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congratulations to you and your organization for navigating everything so slowly right now. But looking
at the forward, I'm kind of curious on the pricing outlook. You guys mentioned that you expect pricing
in North America to moderate to 1.5% to 2%, which I believe is pretty much singularly the effect of last
year's price increases. Said differently, it suggests you're not expecting some of this trade efficiency and
benefits of lower promotions to sustain. If so, why not? Because it looks like the promotional environment
for both you and your competitors remains pretty subdued in July. Why would it come back so quickly?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

So first of all, as we look at the promotional pricing that you see as you look at some of the retail scanner
data, we do not believe that data is correct. There is a lot less auditing going on during this time than
previously. So the biggest issue we think there is we think simply the data is just not correct. We are
continuing to see the kind of promotional activity that we had planned in the second quarter behind
S'mores, Twizzlers, our Reese's in and out level promotion. And going forward, we feel good about the
promotional plans that we have in the back half of the year with our retail partners. So yes...

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

I -- we look at revenue management all the time. And so driving trade efficiency is part of the base plan.
But as Michele said, the outsized impact that we saw in the second quarter was really more a data issue.
Yes, we were out in stores, S'mores routes, Twizzlers' route, so we had quite a bit of promotion.

Jason M. English
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Interesting. I hadn't heard that. That's good context. Sticking on the same theme of pricing but flashing
forward. As you mentioned, you're on the brink of cycling last year's price increases. Pricing has been
part of your growth over in North America for the last couple of years. I don't think you've announced
anything new and [indiscernible]. As we think beyond this year, should we expect pricing to exit part of
the algorithm for the foreseeable future? And if not, why not?

Chairman, President & CEO

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

No. We -- I mean, we remain committed to the pricing strategy that we've discussed with all of you
before, and that's really behind small and more frequent price increases. While we have priced each of the
last 2 years, that certainly doesn't mean within our strategy that we have plans to price every single year.
We really take a strategic approach where we look at opportunities across the portfolio.

Right now, all of our pricing initiatives remain on track and we continue to think that we're going to see
price realization in the second half. But as you know, we have several different levers that we rely on
to drive the business. Pricing is one of those but brand investment, key retailer initiatives, innovation,
merchandising, and new capabilities.

That balanced portfolio levers to drive growth is something we really believe in, and we think that, that's
very important. So we'll take a lot of variables into consideration when we decide what's the price, what to
price, how to price and we will be consistent with the stated strategy going forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Crédit Suisse.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Thanks for the question. I guess 2 smaller ones, a follow-up to Jason's. My understanding is over the past
couple of years, you had taken pricing on about 2/3 of the portfolio, which left another 1/3 likely to be
raised as well. I mean has something changed since the start of the year with how you're looking at your
list price increase plan?

I guess that's the key thing, if something changed. And then just a quick follow-up on Mexico. I was
surprised to see Mexico down so much. Do you put that in the category of countries where chocolate is
just not part of the overall embedded culture of the country? Because I thought Mexico had been pretty
resilient in the past.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So relative to pricing, our plans were not impacted or changed for the year. It is correct that we have
1/3 of the portfolio that wasn't priced in those actions, but we did not change our plans throughout the
year on pricing. So we just continue to look across and decide when and what and how were the right
times.

Relative to Mexico, we certainly have seen big disruptions in that market. And I would say I wouldn't put it
as much. Certainly, there are certainly pockets of Mexico where there are economic issues. But the biggest
factor in Mexico has really been the trade, the spread of the virus and then the shutdown of key elements
of the trade, specifically the wholesaler network, distributor network, where we have about 50% of our
business. And so it was really the trade shutdowns that impacted our business in Mexico.

Robert Bain Moskow
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. Can I sneak one more in? Your outlook is very robust for third quarter. And based on the strong
exit rate and the visibility into Halloween, is your assumption that the other 40%, like the element that's
based on sell through, is your assumption that, that part will be down year-over-year? Have you been
appropriately conservative on that element in your outlook?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

I think that we have been appropriately conservative. I think we have partnered with our retailers. So
we've utilized that visibility. We've taken into account what we think the category will be. And importantly,
we've also taken into account what we believe our market share of the category will be based on recent
performance and what's happening in the marketplace right now. So I think if we see pressures in

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Halloween, it's probably going to show up more towards Q4 than Q3 as it will be at that -- those end
periods, post the holiday relative to sell-through at that point in time.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great. Even in 2Q, even with the weaker volume and elevated COVID costs that you incurred, the
company was still able to expand operating margin by 170 basis points or so. So just as we think through
the second half, some of those, I guess, COVID discrete costs begin to dissipate.

Volume starts to pick up based on some of the comments you made about exit rate and things of that
nature. Though perhaps investment spending, I guess, picks up as well. So I guess as we think about
margins in the second half, what would be maybe the key points to consider versus, let's say, where
Hershey came out in 2Q? In other words, would you expect margins to be up similarly to what you saw in
2Q or what are some of the discrete factors that could change that one way or the other?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Do you want to hit that one?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I'd be really happy to take that. You're quite right. Q2 turned out to be more favorable from a margin
standpoint than we expected going in. And while we had incentives, some of those incentives were less
than what we had expected for the quarter. Insurance costs that we had expected for the second quarter
came out more favorably. We talked on the last call about productivity and productivity being a risk for the
quarter. And in fact, the productivity goals and manufacturing were still achieved.

Probably the lingering piece is PPE and cleaning costs that will continue. So if we kind of take Q2 and look
to the future. Obviously the incentives based on everything we know today are not returning. Productivity,
we expect to continue, along with our full year plan. PP&E, it's not a big cost in the quarter. So I think, $3
million, $4 million a quarter as a benchmark. We'll continue to drive SG&A savings, both at the corporate
level with travel and meetings, as well as at the division level.

And then as you said, we're going to spend a little bit more back from a DME standpoint. So while we had
an opportunity in Q2 to optimize, probably optimize a little bit more than we had expected. We are going
to invest back more behind the brands as we get to the back half of the year. So -- and a little bit less
pricing benefit as well. You had a lot of pricing benefit across the first half. As we lap now, that will also
start to come off. So those are the big drivers. And that's the reason, again, not giving specific guidance,
but expecting some margin acceleration in the back half.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Very helpful there. And just one last one, Michele. The market share gains that Hershey's been seeing,
right, have been pretty phenomenal and unprecedented in many ways. And certainly, a big part of that
has been the company's execution, right, particularly at the point-of-sale and in-store, and leveraging the
advantaged distribution model that you have.

I know there have been some issues at competitors. Let's say, around -- let's say, supply chain, resiliency
and things like that. So I'm just trying to get a sense, as you think through how market share can
sometimes be pretty sticky, both when it's gained and when it's lost. How do you think about the share
that Hershey's picked up?

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

I would assume that at some point, as things normalize and competitors get back their whatever supply
chain resiliency, there'll be some additional pressure on that front. But I'm just trying to get a sense of
how much do you think of share can kind of structurally remain or be sticky versus, let's say, some that
might be more transitory, if you get what I'm asking.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. No. Absolutely. I guess, I'd start by saying, even pre-COVID, we had very good momentum in both
takeaway and market share starting last year. And we really attribute that to the balanced activation
plan and great execution that we had even then, which was a good -- I think the right balance across
advertising, distribution, pricing, seasons and innovation, kind of that suite of levers that we have.

Obviously since COVID, as you mentioned, our teams really stepped up relative to execution, keeping
product on shelf while there were some struggles amongst other competitors in the marketplace. And
certainly, we do know some competitors also begin to rationalize SKUs to simplify their portfolios. So we
do believe that the recent share performance is likely to persist for several more months.

And while we do think that, that huge gain that we're seeing is likely to revert next year as we lap the
strength, we do believe that some of the gains will remain in the long-term and sustain.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I also wanted to follow-up on Jason English's question, really just to make sure I understood your
response, because you did say in the prepared remarks, "Price realization contributed 4.2 points in
the quarter, slightly ahead of expectations, due to incremental trade efficiencies realized from revenue
management and selective programming choices related to COVID-19."

So sorry for reading all of that, but I did interpret this quote, especially the part about selective
programming choices, to mean that you did reduce your reliance on discounting in the second quarter. So
I guess, given that you're not changing your guidance for the back half of the year, doesn't that imply that
you're going from a period of less discounting to a period of sort of more normal discounting or what am I
missing there? I'm just still not sure I understand exactly what that quote means, maybe.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

So we did pull back a little bit in the second quarter, and that was primarily around refreshment, given
what was going on with refreshment being so incredibly soft and the functional demand just not being
there as much for that product, especially given its presence in convenience stores. And also a bit on
grocery, just because that part of the business was doing so incredibly well on its own.

A little bit on S'mores. We had really strong demand on S'mores. But what I would say is the trends are
now stabilizing as the most severe declines on certain parts or most severe accelerations on parts of the
portfolio in Q2, you saw the wildest swings, and those tend to be stabilizing a bit now.

So we are kind of going back to a more normalizing approach. It wasn't a huge pullback in Q2. It was very
selective against those parts of the portfolio. Does that help?

Kenneth B. Goldman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. No. That's clear. And then for my follow-up, some of your peers in the broader sort of food and
beverage industry have talked about making some pretty -- pretty meaningful reductions to their product
portfolios in terms of SKUs. We haven't heard quite as much from Hershey on that. I'm just trying to --
or I'm hoping to get an update from you in terms of how you think the breadth of your portfolio is right

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

now in a post-COVID world? And whether there are any plans, I guess, to sort of make major reductions
or minors to some of the products that you might have?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So we had already really embarked upon an SKU rationalization program, really, over the past 2, 2.5
years. So we had pretty aggressively taken a look across our portfolio and made a lot of those cuts. So at
this point in time, we're feeling pretty good about where we are. I don't see a major program. Obviously
it's always an ongoing focus to optimize and to cut some of the small things. But the biggest steps, we had
already taken previously.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

And meanwhile, some of the new innovations that we brought to market this year have done quite well.
So where we brought in new SKUs, whether it was Kit Kat, Birthday or Cake Pod so.

Operator

So our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.

Sunil Harshad Modi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. So just a kind of 2-parter on innovation. It's nice to see retailers taking on new products. We've been
seeing that trend now. Obviously people were a little doubtful of how much new product would actually get
into retail given the focus on A-level SKUs.

But Michele, I was wondering if you can just opine on -- has there been a philosophical difference at retail
that you can discern in terms of what products they're actually taking on the shelf? And I'm really trying
to get at our large companies like Hershey advantage from this situation, in terms of new product, given
well-known brands, et cetera.

And then on the second piece of that, just some of the work we've done looking at numerator data would
suggest there's a heavy degree of interaction between the Hershey portfolio and the snack cake category.
And I know you've dabbled in that area to some degree with Mrs. Freshley's. But can you just give us
some thoughts on how you're thinking about that adjacency, kind of opportunity a little bit more broadly?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So starting with your first question. We definitely have seen retailers, especially during the COVID
situation, dial up their focus on power SKUs, must-have SKUs, really because of the huge consumer
demand and needing to make sure that they were in stock on the most important items.

And also just because of labor needs and all of that. Just a focus on what's really going to deliver the
business. I think that's what -- why you're seeing many of the manufacturers also now start to really
rethink their portfolios to do the same.

So I would say yes. I think the retail trade is saying, "Hey, right now, this is a time where we need to
focus on those biggest, most important items." So I think you're right about that. And then -- I'm sorry,
could you remind me again your second question. I lost [indiscernible] track.

Sunil Harshad Modi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. No problem.

Snack Cake.

Sunil Harshad Modi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. Snack Cake category.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So we have seen some similarity, some crossover in terms of candy and snack cake consumption.
They both have some similar traits in terms of really hitting the kind of the treat sweet tooth and filling
certain needs for consumers that are similar. So I think we have seen some of that crossover, certainly
from consumers.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just 2 quick ones for me. One, you gave some color in the press release about performance in June. So
just curious if July has continued to progress the same way. And then the second question is more around
distribution gains. I think you've referenced in response to Andrew's question, that some of the issues that
some of your competitors have had.

So I guess, if they're reducing SKUs and maybe having trouble keeping some things in stock, have you
actually gained shelf space or gained distribution in this time period? And if so, kind of -- if you could give
some color in terms of which channels? Is it more convenience than gas, more in grocery? Just some more
color there would be helpful.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

So we haven't really seen any material changes in July versus our trends. So there are some geographic
differences, just given the big differential across geographies as a result of COVID. So no, I would say,
we're feeling good about what we continue to see. And market share is pretty consistent, though. In terms
of our market share performance, I would say, we're feeling pretty good in terms of the continuation of
that trend.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

And I think wherever we've had opportunity to take advantage of getting shelf space or broader
distribution, I'd say it's crossed over all classes of trade.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And we certainly -- those are some of the benefits that I think you don't always see immediately
because you planogram timing, et cetera, to realize those benefits. So some of those benefits, I think, we
started to see in June, and that might be what's driving some of our continued trends -- positive trends in
July.

Sunil Harshad Modi
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. So you have seen some shelf space gains or some distribution gains?

Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with DD Research.

David Christopher Driscoll
DD Research LLC

I wanted to ask about a little bit on the seasonal candy and then a specific question on Halloween, but
they're related. So I know for the full year, roughly 1/3 of the portfolio is seasonal candy. But in just the
second half of the year, can you give us the breakdown between your seasonal sales and your everyday
sales? What percent of the second half is actual seasonal?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Well Halloween, we've said previously is about 10% of our full year business. Certainly, seasons are higher
in the second half than they are in the first half because Valentine's is our smallest holiday. So you really
have Easter as a big one in the first half. We don't really want to get into some of the specifics by quarter,
but I would say that the season's impact is definitely bigger in the second half than the first half.

David Christopher Driscoll
DD Research LLC

And then I -- just to be clear, I think what you're saying is, I think you said this in the release, that you
don't expect Halloween to have a material impact. So it sounds like it's flat. And if seasons are 40% or
something like that of the second half, and the seasonal numbers are expected to be roughly flattish, and
your every day is running up 9%. I think that's what you also said in the release. Then is that not a decent
way to think about how to model North America in the second half?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

I think your math is generally correct. I can't argue with the math. The one thing I would say is, you're
speaking specifically to measured channels. And you need to remember the impact of nonmeasured
channels, owned retail, foodservice, air travel, world travel retail, which is airlines.

And the trends on those businesses as that does -- that has been, as we've shared, the biggest hit in our
business. So while those channels are certainly not shut down like they were in Q2, they're in the recovery
mode and the recovery mode is definitely going to be a slow uptick.

David Christopher Driscoll
DD Research LLC

Okay. So that -- there's a little adjustment to maybe the everyday 9% that I quoted because of those
unmeasured channels. And then seasonal is -- the execution is roughly flattish given what you know
today. Obviously there's plenty of caveats in what could change. So I think I'm understanding you.

My follow-up question is just on your marketing and your overall expenses. So a tremendous job, I'll
give you guys huge kudos on what you did in the second quarter to get your margins where they came
out. I'm just curious that is there a learning here that you can actually run a significantly tighter expense
budget on a go-forward basis? I'm guessing that the COVID made you do certain things that you normally
wouldn't have done.

And the results here of market share gains are fantastic. When you think a year forward, 2 years forward,
can some of these cost reductions be very sticky because it's proving that you didn't need to spend some
of those monies in order to produce, I think, excellent results at retail.

I think SG&A is clearly an area that we're expecting, that how much we need to spend will change
permanently over time. So I think that piece, yes. I think on the marketing expenses, it's a little bit
different. Certainly, some of our pullbacks were as a result of certain businesses like refreshment that
were down 40%.

We just didn't think it made sense to be spending into that. Then as part of what we were able to do was
to leverage the fact that a lot of advertisers dropped out of the marketplace. And as a result, the costs of
media were less than we had planned them to be. And so we were able to have a nice outcome there.

As advertisers come back into the marketplace, some of that pricing benefit is not going to be available
anymore. So while there may be some ongoing efficiencies, and we are always looking to tighten our data
knowledge and capabilities around media since we are big spenders to get more for our money, and we're
always building capability to take it to the next level, there were some unique circumstances there as well.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. I agree. Certainly, on the pricing for some of the media exposure that came down, that was a big
benefit. I think we did benefit from tools and investments we made around marketing efficiencies and
driving ROI and optimizing. We haven't talked as much about some of those tools.

Tools both on trade efficiency, but also marketing spend efficiency. And those tools allowed us also to be
more agile as things evolve quickly. And so that part is something we'll look to leverage further in the
future.

Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I just want to follow-up on that. Halloween comment in your prepared remarks. You mentioned that the
seasonal performance would not have a material impact to second half results. And that's an interesting
comment. I mean we're not doing the official guidance here.

You would think that, that would be a big variable. It might be 20% of your second half revenue. So is
there something that's giving you confidence there? I know that you wouldn't be making such a comment
without perhaps orders in hand or some insights around the ability for you to sell that through, even if it
doesn't happen to trick or treaters. And I have a follow-up.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean I think the confidence drivers are orders in hand. Some of the dynamics that exist around the
fact that only half of that Halloween volume is trick or treat. The fact that the tricker's treat behavior is
outdoor, people do wear masks. So as we get closer, we're feeling good about that.

Now obviously certainly, we didn't provide official guidance in the back half of the year. And there is
uncertainty and volatility overall given the virus. But based on everything that we know and the visibility
we have and with every day we get closer, we feel that we've taken an appropriate look at what we think
can happen and have really factored that into our outlook as best possible.

We've mitigated some of the downside risks with the everyday portfolio versus all Halloween packaging.
Steve, anything you would add to that?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

No. I would agree. I think for the things we can see and certainly, the things we can control, we're
optimistic. But part of the reason for not providing more specific guidance is there are things we can't

control and probably can't see. And for those reasons, there's still is potential variability in the back half.
But everything we can see gives us a point of confidence.

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. That's helpful. And with regard to COVID-related costs, you mentioned those were a gross margin
headwind in the second quarter. Could you give some color as to how much that might have been? And
how much of a gross margin headwind do you think it's going to be for the year?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

In terms of just COVID-related costs?

David Sterling Palmer
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just COVID-related costs, yes.

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Probably on the order of -- we absorbed a gross margin somewhere between $15 million and $20
million of COVID-related costs. Again, we had predicted it might be more than that. In fact, it came out
less.

As we go forward in the rest of the year, the biggest piece that will stick around is going to be that
personal protective equipment, cleaning cost. And so if I take that 15% to 20%, think about maybe 1/3 or
a quarter becomes sticky to the back half.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I had a question on c-store traffic and momentum there. We've obviously seen the convenience store
channel improve, right, throughout the quarter overall. Seems like hopefully, that momentum is
sustainable as long as either people are leaving their homes more and going to the channel. But also that
channel is more relevant for you than a lot of other companies in the space.

And usually, I would think there's a little bit more of a margin benefit just given the single-serve product
that you sold there -- that you saw there. But in the remarks, you said that margin mix really didn't have
much of a headwind. It doesn't sound like you're really speaking to that as a risk going forward, which is
great.

I'm just kind of curious where I'd be wrong in thinking that some of that single-serve products would
usually have a better price per pound and potentially better margin impact, and why it didn't and why it
might not?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean I think that's generally correct. We are seeing a rebound in convenience stores as people are
out and about more. And I think also as some people are choosing not to travel via air, but do vacations
that are more driving vacations. So I think that's helping as well. So yes, I think certainly, instant
consumable and that class of trade are helping the business.

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

We're also seeing instant consumable strong and strength in other classes of trade as people have
returned more now to grocery stores and trips and shopping. So the strength is not just in convenient
stores. So that is helping our margin mix.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So it sounds like even though, if I think about movie theater, right? Even though consumers might not
be going to movie theaters and buying Hershey product there, in a single-serve format, as well as traffic
stops at c-stores that maybe like you're seeing in grocery stores a bit. That they're still trying to get their
fix, right?

So they might not be buying a big bag but as they go through checkout, it sounds like what you're saying
is maybe some of your checkout momentum in traditional mass in grocery is doing better than maybe it
had. And I know if we go back a couple of years, that at one point in time, that was a focus of yours. Is
that fair?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. It does -- it's fair. It has definitely -- we're seeing growth on the consumable piece of the business.
And again, I think a lot of that due to more traffic in those channels.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Right. And then just lastly, just to keep it simple and summarize. As you did say if a consumables is
growing, right, so the [indiscernible] there is, it has to be doing very well. A c-store has to be doing very
well into the [indiscernible] mass and grocery at checkout. And that's more offsetting the pressure away-
from-home and other channels.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, yes.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.

Alexia Jane Burland Howard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

So 2 questions from me. Firstly, could you maybe just talk a little bit about what's going on in the e-
commerce channels? Other companies have talked about real surges, both in terms of click and collect and
in at-home delivery.

I'm wondering whether maybe the meltability of chocolate in this hot season means that the delivery
option isn't quite as available to you. But just curious about what's going on there. And then my second
question is more about your marketing mix strategy in the second half. We know that in the TV channels,
the production isn't going to be as -- there's not going to be as much new production in the fall.

And therefore, the effectiveness of marketing on TV may drop off. But also, I know that you've announced
that you're pulling back on your Facebook spending in the second half as well. So I'm just wondering
where that spend is going to go? Is it going to be into other digital channels or how you're thinking about
the mix?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

15

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Yes. So we have continued to see our category and our business perform really well in e-commerce and
seen that growth accelerate. So in the second quarter, we saw growth of 200% on our e-commerce
business, and that was really driven by strength, both in the click and collect-kind of pickup and in delivery
fulfillment models.

So we saw growth across the board there. You're right that we tend to have a little bit of a softer business
during the hottest months in the summer. But we're continuing to see that pretty strong growth even
throughout June.

So I think just the trends are bolstering that. And that growth, importantly, we're seeing across every
piece of the business. Seasons take-home and instant consumables. So in the past, we've spoken about
e-commerce being roughly 2% of our business. And we believe that this channel, by end of year, could
approximate about 5% of our total company sales. So definitely seeing a lot of strength there.

When it comes to marketing mix. Certainly, we're seeing efficiencies that we're going to realize in the back
half in that TV class of trade. So it continues to be a really viable place for us to put money given the very
high household penetration on our business and the sheer number of eyeballs that you can reach on TV
it's very efficient.

And as we look to digital and the pullback on Facebook, we see taking those funds that were in Facebook
and redirecting them still back into other digital media venues. So those dollars will stay in digital, but just
on other platforms like YouTube, for example.

Operator

Our next question will be Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I guess, first, internationally. I appreciate the category itself was under pressure in many of your key
markets, as you called out. But can you talk a bit about your market share trends in those markets? And
maybe a little color as to how you're thinking about relative prioritization of investment in those markets,
as hopefully they begin to improve in the months and quarters ahead?

I guess what I'm thinking through is should we expect you to exit the crisis with similar levels of strategic
emphasis and standing in those emerging markets versus the run rate going in? Or is there a risk that you
slip a bit behind as navigating the U.S. landscape takes precedent?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So we are gaining market share across most of our international markets. So we feel great about
that. The weakness that we're seeing is really driven either by the COVID-related shutdowns in most of
the markets, government-restricted shutdowns and especially in a lot of the developing markets.

And in some markets, the economic impact of that, that impacts the category. But we feel great that
we're winning share across most of those markets. So I don't think that we will -- relative to our strategic
emphasis, we are still committed to what we want to get achieved in those markets.

We still believe in the long-term potential on those markets. So we are pulling back on a temporary basis,
just consistent with where the business is, but continuing our focus on all of our key initiatives to win long-
term in those markets.

Stephen Robert R. Powers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, if I could, just to clean up back on the forward pricing outlook.
Your core category [indiscernible] exceptionally rational in recent years. And I guess just given your share
gain success, and I guess some also just the economic pressure that might build in the back half and into
'21, how do you size up the tail risk that some of that price rationale might come under challenge? Or at

least make incremental pricing tougher to come by and at least the near term? I guess, harking back to
Jason English's question earlier.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

We just -- we consider a lot of factors as we try and decide how to think about how and when to price. So
as it comes to recessionary times, over the past, we've seen that our category tends to have less of the
highs and lows that some other categories have because we are an affordable luxury. So at times when
people need to cut back on other categories.

So we will continue to just evaluate all the different factors for when, how, on what we will take pricing.
But we aren't particularly concerned that we can't price in recessionary times. We have done that at points
in the past.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.

John Joseph Baumgartner
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Michele, just in light of your general sense of optimism for Halloween. And I guess sticking with the brand
investment plans, it sounds as though there will be some shift of March Madness and Olympic spending
into H2. But could you also talk a little bit about the in-store merchandising activity?

I mean, are you expecting an uptick in retailer support for the season this year? And, I guess, increased
display space for your portfolio broadly?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean we are expecting, based on our partnerships with retailers, very strong in-store support
for Halloween with most of our retailers. We partner with every retailer and each retailer has their own
strategy in terms of how much they support the holiday. And so I think, in general, most of them are
continuing to lean in to anticipate and drive to a very strong Halloween.

And we believe that given our ability to execute during this time and some of the -- you've seen the
results of that on the share in the marketplace, we certainly think that even our performance within the
category for Halloween should be quite strong.

John Joseph Baumgartner
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just coming back to international and the sales weakness there. I would guess, a
presumed review of the cost structure. Given the success you had in rightsizing China, which was sort
of a unique animal in its own right, to what extent is COVID stress sort of identifying new opportunities
in other geographies, where you can use this downturn to maybe further strengthen your global cost
structure more sustainably?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Steve, do you want to talk about that?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Our international team does a great job of looking to optimize their P&L and cost structure on an
ongoing basis. And certainly, the new opportunities here as businesses think curtailed in some markets
has shown even further potential there.

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

But I think to Michele's earlier point, the strategic priority of international hasn't changed. And so we
want to continue to appropriately invest behind those businesses to unlock the long-term growth that we
believe is there. But to your point, certainly, we'll never waste a crisis in terms of looking at every possible
way to be efficient with P&L.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Can you just talk about corporate costs a little bit? It looks like it's the lowest they've been in at least
about 7 years, certainly declined sequentially. You called out the travel and meeting savings. How much of
that should we expect to continue? Is there other savings there that might revert back in the second half,
we should watch out for? How do we think about looking ahead on how that line might unfold?

Steven E. Voskuil
Senior VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. The progress that we made in the second quarter, we said from a travel and meeting standpoint, was
actually better than we expected going into the quarter. And given everything we see today, business is
not going to return to whatever normal was. And so we expect in the back half, we're going to see those
savings continue.

As I think about the second quarter, we saw probably $20 million -- $15 million to $20 million of
opportunity across all of those areas. And I'd expect to see something like that, maybe a little bit less but
something like that in the back half as well. And beyond that, that was really the biggest driver from a
corporate cost standpoint.

Michael Scott Lavery
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Great. And just following up on Halloween again. Can you give us a sense of what some of your
options may be? I know you recognize there's a little bit of an uncertainty still on how the consumer sell-
through goes.

If that disappoints, do you just have to buy it all back? Can you buy some down? Does it depend on the
magnitude of inventory that may be left? Can you just let us know what the options are and how you
might be preparing for any of those?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So the first thing we're doing is trying to make sure that we ensure sell-through, which is something
we always do, which is having the right merchandising, getting product on the floor as early as possible
and leveraging media investments to remind consumers, excite consumers about the holiday.

Then post sell-through, there's always a markdown period that occurs based on how much product
actually sells through, both in total as well as you have to get the mix right across each piece of the
portfolio. And so every year, as we build our plans, we plan for that.

And this year is no different. We planned for that. So we tried to mitigate our risk by -- as we look at the
trick or treat portion of the portfolio, pulling back on seasonal packaging, having more every day. So that's
one -- another lever we use and then really working through the markdown plan.

BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I just have 2 questions. One is, have you at all kind of changed your innovation plans for -- I don't mean
for the next 2 months or 3 months, but for the longer term. There's been a lot of companies who have
said, "Look, our 150th new innovation, we're not going to do anymore." So has there been a refinement of
the innovation program for the next, call it, 1 to 2 years?

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

So I would say we already did that. A few years back, we took a look at our innovation strategy and
really streamlined and focused on sustainability. And that really did lead to not having that 150th new
innovation, but really being very real about a focus on sustainability that would lead to the greatest
profitability and top line for us.

So we're not really making any changes related to COVID, but I feel really good about the work that we
did a couple of years ago, changing our innovation strategy to make sure that we really did have that
focus across the balanced levers. Innovation is one of 5 or 6 levers. It's not the lever.

Kenneth Bryan Zaslow
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And then when I think about the longer term, and obviously the COVID-19 is evolving for sure. But
are there certain milestones? Are there certain things that would have to happen for you to rethink? It
seems like as of now, let me start with this, as of now, it doesn't seem like you've made any structural
changes to your business model.

You've changed a little bit of investment here and there, but nothing that would be longer term. Are there
anything that you would see in the COVID-19 implications that would cause you to have to do something?
And what would that thing be that you would have to do to change your business model, if that makes
sense.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So I guess I would say there's nothing that I would say is a big fundamental shift to our business
model. There are some changes. So for example, e-commerce, the acceleration in e-commerce is here to
stay. Where consumers are in terms of household penetration of people buying online is where we thought
it would be maybe 5 years from now. So to some degree, that is a shift because e-commerce is a little
more than a channel. It's almost a business model as well.

So fortunately, a few years back, we had invested to build capability in e-commerce, and I feel really good
that we were set up to be able to take advantage of that, but we are taking some further steps internally
to develop e-commerce to really now be one of our mainstream channels versus before, it was kind of, I'd
say, in the growth development phase.

There are other consumer trends, things like cocooning and people staying at home. The importance of
value on the short-term. Some of those trends that we are making some changes to adapt to, but we
always change -- adapt to ever-changing consumer trends. So I wouldn't really call those out as business
model changes.

And then certainly, there will be some changes in terms of how we work, in terms of some people working
more from home, the ability to have people working remotely, potentially a shift to suburban and rural
settings, which actually can be a strength for us. But I would say e-commerce is probably what I would
put in the -- in one of the bigger shifts like that. Steve, is there anything you want to say?

THE HERSHEY COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 23, 2020

Yes. I just -- if I turn the question around, I would say COVID is also shown as places where we have
strength through this and having the agility in our supply chain, the retail execution capability. As Michele
said, the digital investments, the agile investment approach. I think those are things that we've learned
are even stronger in this kind of environment.

Kenneth Bryan Zaslow
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

What if they -- refresh me, everybody is working from home a little bit more. People don't need to have
the meetings. And so your refreshment category may change dramatically or maybe the size of Halloween
or the size of Easter may kind of contract.

Are there thoughts on those 2 potential outcomes? Or at this point, you'd say not really something that
we'd be worried about? And I'll leave it there, and I appreciate your time.

Michele Gross Buck
Chairman, President & CEO

I mean first of all, based on seasons, I would say, not something that I'd be worried about at this point in
time, given the results that we saw on Easter, which was really in a peak period of people being told not to
go to grocery stores, and we still had a pretty decent Easter.

I mean obviously we will all learn more as we go through every one of these. But at this point in time, I
don't see a major business model shift needing to come from that. And I would say from a refreshment
perspective, yes, people will be working from how the people are also going to be going out, and they're
going to be out and about doing things, I think, more.

So there could be some -- I'm going to say, more shifts as there always are in portfolio relative to people
baking more, people doing one thing or the other more, but not that I think I really think about as a
massive business model shift.
