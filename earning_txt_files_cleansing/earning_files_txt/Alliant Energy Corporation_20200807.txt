ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Alliant Energy's Conference Call for the Second Quarter 2020 Results.
This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Investor Relations Manager at Alliant
Energy. Please go ahead.

Susan Trapp Gille
Manager of Investor Relations

Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We
appreciate your participation.

Joining me on this call are John Larsen, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Robert
Durian, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following prepared remarks by John and Robert, we will have
time to take questions from the investment community.

We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's second quarter financial results and
reaffirmed the consolidated 2020 earnings guidance issued in November 2019. This release as well as
supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the Investor page of our
website at www.alliantenergy.com.

Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your
questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that
could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed
in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation
between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and our 10-Q, which will be
available on our website.

At this point, I'll turn the call over to John.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks, Sue. Good morning, everyone. I hope you're all staying safe and healthy. Thank you for joining
us today as we highlight our solid results for the second quarter of 2020. I'll share a few notable stories
from the quarter and then turn the call over to Robert as he recaps some of our regulatory, customer and
financial highlights.

I'll start my comments with a focus on our recently issued Corporate Responsibility Report. This year's
update showcases many examples of our environmental stewardship as well as our long-standing efforts
to address the important social needs of the communities we proudly serve.

On the environmental front, we were excited to announce that we achieved our 2030 goal of having 30%
of our energy mix come from carbon-free renewable resources, 10 years ahead of schedule. And we're not
stopping there. Our customer-focused strategy continues to advance us toward a clean-energy future. And
our responsibility report has been updated with new and even more aggressive clean-energy goals. These
new goals are shown on Slide 2 of the supplemental slides.

Our report also highlights the great work of our employees to support our customers and communities.
This is not new for Alliant Energy. It's part of how we do business. We've continued to support our
customers and communities as they respond to the ongoing demands of the COVID-19 health and
economic crisis. Our charitable foundation recently released a new wave of community grants, benefiting

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

more than 230 nonprofit organizations across Iowa and Wisconsin. Our stated purpose to serve customers
and build stronger communities is core to everything we do, and we're proud of the many ways we help to
build stronger communities where we live, work and raise our families.

Now more than ever, the social part of our corporate responsibility is at the forefront. We are committed
to partnering with our communities, working to understand and help address their needs. We act by
providing financial support to agencies and nonprofit organizations that help our communities bridge
gaps of social inequities and through programs that support food and security and housing, workforce
readiness, environmental stewardship and diversity, safety and wellbeing. Our employees and retirees are
a driving force in our communities, and I'm very proud to be part of the company that lives our values in
so many ways.

In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert, who will address the trends we are seeing across our
residential, commercial and industrial customer bases as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. Our
employees have made great progress in driving cost reductions and advancing our broader transformation
efforts during the first half of the year while keeping a strong focus on safety and reliability.

Turning to the execution of our strategy, I'll highlight progress we've made as we advance our Clean
Energy Vision. A key driver to achieving our goals is the continued successful advancement of new
renewable energy source, wind and solar. In May, we filed a Certificate of Authority with the Public Service
Commission of Wisconsin for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. Collectively, these solar projects
are expected to create more than 1,200 local construction jobs and, once operational, will provide an
estimated $80 million in local tax revenues over the next 30 years.

In conjunction with our solar filing, we also announced our plans to retire our Edgewater Generating
Station. Our efforts to transition our generation to a cleaner and more efficient fleet are not new. In
fact, we've been on this path for over a decade. As we have in the past, we will live our values to care
for others and do the right thing as we support the transition of impacted employees in the Sheboygan
community.

The expansion of our Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio as well as the decision to retire the
Edgewater facility was a result of a year-long process that involved working with key stakeholders and
ultimately forming what we call our Clean Energy Blueprint. We have a similar process started in Iowa and
expect to share the results of our Clean Energy Blueprint for our IPL business later this year.

Speaking of Iowa, I'll also share that we recently announced an innovative partnership with the city of
Decorah. The new project features a 2.5-megawatt battery storage facility to support distributed solar.
This battery system will help us better serve the community and allow us to efficiently integrate a growing
desire for distributed energy resources.

And while a lot of great work is happening related to solar and energy storage, I also want to highlight
American Wind Week, which kicks off next Monday. We are proud to be part of advancing wind energy and
the many benefits it brings to our customers and rural communities.

We remain on track to install an additional 280 megawatts of wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers
by the end of this year. Our 130-megawatt Richland wind farm will be completed by the end of the third
quarter. And our 150-megawatt Kossuth wind farm is 80% complete and will be placed into service in the
fourth quarter of this year, making us the third largest owner-operator of regulated wind in the United
States.

To summarize, we remain committed to focusing on the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees,
customers and communities, advancing our Clean Energy Vision, ensuring our investments are well
executed, efficient and customer-focused, and delivering consistent returns for our investors with a 5% to
7% growth rate and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio.

Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert.

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings
of $0.54 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher
earnings year-over-year, driven by increasing rate base and higher electric margins from warmer
temperatures. These increases in earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. We
provided additional details on earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 3 and 4.

Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales in the second quarter were down 6% versus last year,
reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Residential temperature-normalized sales increased 5%
year-over-year, largely driven by our customers spending more time at home.

On the other hand, commercial and industrial temperature-normalized sales declined 9%. Manufacturing
sales, which make up approximately 50% of our commercial and industrial sales, were down 15% to 25%
during April and May. And as expected, we saw material declines in electric sales in April and May to other
sectors of our commercial and industrial customers, including retail, lodging and food service as a result of
temporary business closures.

More recently, we've been encouraged to see electric sales to our commercial and industrial customers
rebound in June and July to levels that were only modestly lower than the same month last year. We are
also fortunate to have a broad diversity of customers across our 2 state jurisdictions, but even saw certain
customers, such as our food processing, packaging and warehouse customers, having flat to higher-than-
normal sales at the initial months of the pandemic.

With the faster-than-expected rebound in electric sales, we have updated our current projections to reflect
an approximate 2% to 3% reduction in temperature-normalized electric sales for calendar year 2020
compared to last year. We have made significant progress mitigating this pandemic-related sales declines
by accelerating planned cost transformation activities and reimagining how we do work. This is a direct
reflection of our employees' leadership and dedication to reducing cost for our customers.

I speak for the entire executive team in sharing my appreciation for the employees of Alliant Energy,
especially for the men and women who are in the field each day, ensuring the safe and reliable delivery
of affordable energy to our customers throughout this pandemic. The health crisis has reaffirmed how
essential energy services are to the country and a reminder of just how critical our purpose is to the
communities and customers we serve.

Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our
consolidated group. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 10% for 2020. The
primary drivers of the lower tax rate are production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits which
flowed back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins, thereby resulting in no material impact on
full year earnings.

The timing of wind production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized will
cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. This results in higher earnings in the first half of the
year and lower earnings in the second half of the year when compared to the results of last year.

On Slide 7, we have provided the details of our financial plan for 2020, which has now largely been
completed. In June, we finalized a $400 million, 10-year bond issuance at our Iowa utility and used part
of the proceeds to call early a maturity that was due later this year. This deal was well received by the
market and achieved the lowest bond interest rate in our Iowa utility's history. We will also use a portion
of the remaining proceeds from the new bond issuance to make $110 million payment in September for
the buyout of the Duane Arnold purchase power agreement.

Our current liquidity is approximately $1.1 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit
facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. With no material debt maturities in 2021, we are well
positioned to respond to any potential changes in projected cash flows.

The key to achieving our updated carbon dioxide emission goals is expanding our use of clean energy
resources. As John mentioned, we recently announced plans to retire one of our Wisconsin coal-fired
generator facilities and to add 1,000 megawatts of solar in Wisconsin by the end of 2023. We recently filed
a Certificate of Authority request for the first phase of construction, which includes 675 megawatts of new

solar generation. As a result of this filing, we are planning to ship $350 million of capital expenditures into
2021 and 2022 that were originally forecasted in 2023.

The earlier timing of capital expenditures is based on our progress with development activities to date
and the expected construction schedules. Our forecast also assumes 35% of the construction costs will be
financed through tax equity partners. The contributions from the tax equity partners are current when the
projects are placed in service. We expect to place 425 megawatts of solar into service in 2022 and 575
megawatts of the service in 2023.

We plan to refresh our full future capital expenditure forecast and disclose our 2021 financing plans as
part of our third quarter earnings release in November.

Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 8. As shown on the slide, our regulatory
calendar for 2020 has many key milestones now behind us. The one noteworthy disclosure development
since our last quarterly earnings call was the Wisconsin Certificate of Authority filing in late May for 675
megawatts of new solar generation. The filing is progressing as expected, and we are currently awaiting
the procedural schedule.

We are also encouraged by the progress on our 2021 customer rate stabilization proposal in Wisconsin.
Comments recently filed by the innovating groups representing our retail customers include support for
the proposal. We anticipate a decision from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on our proposal
later this quarter.

We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with all of you
virtually over the coming months.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

A couple of questions here. First, as far as the demand trend, I think you said manufacturing was down
like 15% to 25%. Do you have overall weather-adjusted demand by month and how that progressed
through the quarter?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Andrew, this is Robert. I'd say what we saw in April and May was the low point. But here in June and
July, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we saw commercial and industrial down maybe about 3%,
and a lot of that was largely offset by an increase in residential sales. So that's the more recent trends
we're seeing and hoping that continues through the remainder of the year. And that's what we project at
this point to get us to a full year forecast of about a 2% to 3% temperature-normalized decrease for the
calendar year relative to last year.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

No, I understand that. I guess I'm asking more, was it a step-up in demand when the states reopened? Or
has it been sort of an ongoing continuous improving trajectory?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

I'd say it's more of a step change when you look from May to June. And I think a part of it, as you
indicated, was largely to reopening the states. But yes, from May to June, it was quite a bit of a jump.
It's a little bit leveled -- levelized off at this point from June to July, but a lot better than we originally
expected. So we're optimistic.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Andrew, it's John here. I think I might add that we've seen businesses really planned for and prepared for
how to operate during the COVID crisis. So we've seen some really innovative ways for businesses to get
back to production and still address the safety needs of employees, et cetera. So I think it's a combination
of that, just some really smart business operations we're seeing as well.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Good to hear. Next question is on the IPL debt issuance. First of all, very impressive coupon at 2.3%. You
walked through the use of proceeds and all that. But I guess I'm asking, it was upsized, right? The first
quarter slide deck showed up to $300 million, and you actually raised $400 million. Can you just discuss
why that was upsized and what that means for the balance sheet and future plans for debt issuances?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Good question, Andrew. Thanks. Yes, as we got into the deal, very strong market demand for that debt
issuance, and we utilize that, obviously, to capture that lower interest rate. To this point, we've used the
proceeds largely for 2 purposes. One is to retire $200 million of debt in June that was expected to be

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

maturing in, I think, September of this year. Right now, we have about $200 million left on our balance
sheet in the form of cash. We're going to use $110 million of that for the payment that we need to make
to NextEra to terminate the Duane Arnold Energy purchase power agreement. And the remaining funds
will largely be invested in the wind projects that we're continuing to finish up, including the Richland
project that will be finished up sometime later this quarter.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Got it. Hard to believe that payment is coming up already in just a month or so. Then one last one, if
I may. The -- I wanted to go back to the option that some of your neighbors in Wisconsin had to buy
ownership slices in West Riverside. I know they have a few more years to decide, I believe until '24 and
'25. But I'm just wondering, have you spoken to them recently? And how are they thinking about the
impact of COVID-19 on demand and the massive growth in renewables, just wondering what the latest
thinking might be as far as how likely they might be to exercise the options? And will you just remind us
what's embedded in your rate base and EPS growth forecast around that?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes, you bet, Andrew. So you've got the timing right for that. And we've assumed that there will be
options taken in our plan. I won't speak for the potential co-owners. I'll let them address that. So nothing
to add on that besides where our plans would assume that they take an ownership interest. And I think
you've got the timing right. Appreciate the question.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Ryan Greenwald with Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

It's Julien here. If I can follow up on the last question a little bit further. You all obviously are changing
your forecast after a pretty meaningful swing in your expectations. What does it say about your cost
latitude and flexibility? Especially, for instance, let's say, things turn around here again, how are you
thinking about the cost levers that you guys spoke about just a few months ago at this point and ability to
use them again?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Julien, thanks for the question. I'd say we're very well prepared going into the second half of the year. The
employees have done an amazing job of identifying a lot of different opportunities to reduce cost for our
customers, a majority of which are sustainable. Others are temporary in nature. But a lot of flexibility is
how I'd characterize it at this point with being able to adjust. If we do see an upsurge or resurgence of the
pandemic and some related sales implications, we feel very well positioned as we look at the rest of the
year here.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got it. Excellent. Okay. And then just coming back to the last question there super quick, if you don't
mind. You always have seen a pretty big swing, as have some of your peers. But I'm just curious, can you
more explicitly define what your Q3 and Q4, like, normalized trajectory would be to reconcile with that 2%
to 3% update? Just a slightly different iteration of the last one as well.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

Yes. Julien, maybe I'll start to share a bit. But I think earlier, we had looked at around 5% to 6% total year
impact. And I think, as Robert said, it's maybe looking more now like in the 2% to 3%. We had planned
for a slow and steady improvement in the back half of the year, nothing right now that would cause us to
think any differently. We did see a step-change improvement in Q2, a little faster recovery towards the tail
end of that than what we had originally planned. And then as Robert mentioned, we're keeping flexibility
in our plan for a little bit of the unknown. So part of our planning was to look at a few different scenarios
for the back half. But assuming it does stay steady and slowly improving, it's certainly going to be overall
better than what we had originally thought. If that addresses your question.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes, indeed. Well, let me try to summarize this, if you don't mind. Are you effectively -- do you have
latitude to be in the upper end of your guidance range? How about that? Given...

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

What I shared, Julien, as Robert noted, we've taken a lot of actions in the first half of the year reducing
cost and help offset lower sales. So that's kept us solidly at the midpoint. But what we take a look here
with the weather trends that we've seen here in July, we would see that helping us trend into the upper
half of the guidance range.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. All right. Fair enough. And sorry, one last one here, if I can. Obviously, with the first wave here,
you're putting some capital. It seems like it's accelerating, if I heard you right, from '23 into '21 and '22
to the tune of $350 million. So that sounds like a net increase in your outlook, at least from a timing
perspective. If I understand, the offset there would be some of that capital that was originally forecast in
'23. I mean, was it always assumed at 35% tax equity? Just to make sure we understand all the puts and
takes here against your outlook.

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. I think you've got that spot on, Julien.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

I wanted to ask on the rate freeze approval in Wisconsin. I think we got some intervenor testimony there
earlier this week. But just kind of what's the remaining path forward here. Were there any issues with
what the intervenors put out there? Can you settle? And when will the commission weigh in on this thing?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Michael, thanks for that question. I'd say we're very encouraged by the progress we're making
with the 2021 customer rate stabilization proposal, and we currently expect the decision from the PSCW
sometime later this quarter, could be as early as later this month. And generally, overall, we saw support
for the plan, given the purpose of it was to really try and protect our customers from rates. Given the
economic conditions that we see through this pandemic, we were very pleased to see the support from the
major customer groups representing our residential and C&I customers.

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 07, 2020

Great. And then my second one was just on -- it seems like with this Clean Energy Vision you guys are
laying out, the continued transition from coal towards renewables, just curious how you're thinking about
the recovery or regulatory treatment of the coal and rate base that you have as you work through this.
I know -- I think Edgewater is going to come up maybe in the next rate case and however you're going
to handle things in Iowa. So yes, maybe just what the past precedent has been and how you're thinking
about this regulatory treatment in the future?

Robert J. Durian
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So I'll give you a little picture of the past precedent. So we've had a few different examples in both
of our jurisdictions where we saw slow recovery of coal plants that we retired early. Both states have
approved both a return of and return on a full recovery of those facilities. Those facilities generated with
the remaining balances are probably in the tens of millions of dollars each.

So as we look forward, we have announced the Edgewater 5 retirements by the end of 2022. So we're
expecting that decision or that issue will be addressed in the next rate filing that we make sometime next
year. Iowa, we've not announced any early retirements to the states, and we're evaluating that as part of
our Clean Energy Blueprint that we're performing in Iowa. And we'll have some more information to share
later this year on any potential early retirements for Iowa state.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Maybe if I could just follow up. I think you just said that the past precedent, we were only talking
tens of millions of dollars, and it sounds like these plans going forward are probably materially higher than
that. So does that potentially change how regulators might be thinking about how they get treated?

John O. Larsen
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Michael, you've got the magnitude, right? I think as we look at some of the larger facilities, they
certainly have a little bit larger balance. But as we filed with our Clean Energy Blueprint, all of that factors
in to show a net customer benefit for our plans going forward. So certainly can't tell you exactly how that's
going to play out with regulators right now. But I think we have a solid track record of working with the
regulators and putting a very solid plan that makes sense for customers or we wouldn't file that. So I'd
say we feel comfortable with that filing, but some of those are yet to be determined.
