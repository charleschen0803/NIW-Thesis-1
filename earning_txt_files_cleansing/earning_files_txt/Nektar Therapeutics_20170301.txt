Thank you, Jennifer, and thanks to everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter and year end conference call
On today’s call we will discuss our progress over the last quarter and year-to-date, provide financial guidance for 2017 and also review the many upcoming catalyst and milestones for Nektar’s pipeline expected in 2017. Nektar had a very successful 2016 during which we advanced multiple Nektar pipeline programs including an emerging immuno-oncology and immunology portfolio
In the fourth quarter we began the clinical development with our collaborator Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of our lead IO program NKTR-214 and BMS’s anti-PD-1 agent Opdivo and five different tumor types and at least eight indications
The BMS collaboration is the first of a number of clinical collaborations for NKTR-214 which are designed to position NKTR-214 as a keystone therapeutic in immuno-oncology
We’ll talk more about our strategy with NKTR-214 on this call and also about our next IO development candidates NKTR-262, a new TLR agonist which complements NKTR-214 and NKTR-255 our novel IO 15 agonist
Our wholly owned pipeline also includes innovative approaches for the treatment of autoimmune disease NKTR-358 and for the treatment of chronic pain NKTR-181. We’re on track to report top line results from the Phase 3 efficacy trial of NKTR-181 in chronic pain patients later this month and we’ve submitted an IND for NKTR-358 and are on track for that molecule to enter the clinic this month
Nektar’s impressive wholly owned R&D pipeline combined with current and future royalties and milestones from our partner portfolio really positions Nektar well for excellent growth in 2017. Our partnered portfolio includes existing products such as MOVANTIK with AstraZeneca and ADYNOVATE with Shire and products which could approved in the next year such as ONZEALD with Daiichi Sankyo, Cipro DPI and Amikacin Inhale with Bayer
Let’s start with MOVANTIK, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo recently launched a new ad campaign with features MOVANTIK specific commercials and DTC advertising
Chronic pain patients and their physicians continue to give favorable reviews to MOVANTIK and the refill rate continues to be its highest 40% to 50% each week
We were very pleased that annual prescriptions grew year-over-year by 270% and peak weekly prescriptions increased year-over-year by over 75% from 5,900 in 2015 to 10,600 in 2016. Currently the annual run rate is over $160 million from MOVANTIK in the US
Gil will provide some more detail on these financials later in the call, we continue to believe that MOVANTIK peak sales can exceed a $1 billion annually, so we’re enthusiastically continuing to watch MOVANTIK’s commercial performance
For ONZEALD which is partnered with Daiichi Sankyo, Europe a conditional marketing authorization is currently under review in Europe, we believe the review for the ONZEALD filing has gone very well and we expect the decision on the conditional approval sometime in the next couple of months
Cipro DPI and Amikacin Inhale which are two separate anti-infective programs with our partner Bayer are on track to complete Phase 3 in the first half of this year as well
The first RESPIRE trial testing Cipro DPI and NCFB was positive and if Bayer is successful with second RESPIRE trial Cipro DPI will represent a large opportunity to address a critical medical need for patients with recovering lung infections
And for Amikacin Inhale Bayer will complete the Phase 3 programs in the second quarter of this year and will be working with Bayer to announce results from this program in the middle of this year
So now let’s move on to discuss Nektar’s growing pipeline
Nektar has built an impressive portfolio with five highly valuable wholly owned drug candidates in the therapeutics areas of immuno-oncology, immunology and chronic pain
In the area of chronic pain, we will un-blind the top line data from the Phase 3 SUMMIT-07 efficacy trial for NKTR-181 later this month
As the first novel Mu-Opioid Agonist molecule to be developed in decades
NKTR-181 could emerge as an important new pain medicine to treat patients with moderate to severe chronic pain
Opioid abuse continues to be a major societal problem and NKTR-181’s unique inherent properties of reduced euphoria and likability uniquely positioned the drug to address the opioid abuse epidemic [ph] and to reduce diversion a prescription pain medic use for the abuse
The drug safety profile may also offer additional advantages over other opioid’s with potential for reduced respiratory depression and sedation
Assuming positive Phase 3 efficacy results from the current SUMMIT-07 trial, we plan to out license NKTR-181 to a company that has a strong presence and long-term commitment in the pain market
As you know Nektar is developing a broad portfolio in immune-oncology
Our goal is to develop medicines which can target multiple steps in the immune cycle in order to stimulate the patient’s immune system to fight cancer
Two of our IO candidates NKTR-214 and NKTR-255 are biologics, which capitalize on the important signalling pathways controlled by IL-2 and IL-15 to stimulate tumor-killing T cells, memory T cells and natural killer cells
And we recently introduced NKTR-262 which is a novel small molecule TLR agonist design to complement NKTR-214 which could give Nektar our first wholly owned combination regimen in IO
NKTR-214 as a T cell growth factor has the potential to fill a critical gap in the immune-oncology therapeutic regimens
NKTR-214 is a new medicine that can activate the immune system and increase the amount of TILs in the tumor microenvironment without the corresponding severe toxicities associated with other modalities
By supplying physicians and patients with an effective means to replenish and activate the effector T cell population, NKTR-214 has the potential to dramatically change the way patients are treated with IL therapies
Mary will go into more detail on the NKTR-214 Nivo program in a moment including the continued expansion of indications and trials with our collaborator Bristol-Myers Squibb
But as you know the dose escalation portion of the NKTR-214 nivolumab trial is well underway
We’re excited about the data that is emerging to-date from the combo trial and we expect to present initial results from the dose escalation part of the study at ASCO this year
Now let me share a few additional development activities for NKTR-214 which are underway
We’re initiating a trial of NKTR-214 with Roche’s TECENTRIQ in the second quarter of this year, as we said in the past our strategy is to position NKTR-214 as a keystone in IO and also demonstrate the NKTR-214 is synergistic with both anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents
Secondly as NKTR-214 is a broad based mechanism we’ve recently begun preclinical studies with several collaborators to evaluate the combination of NKTR-214 with additional mechanisms in IO beyond anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1. This includes preclinical research with personalized vaccines to explore a cancer vaccine program in conjunction with NKTR-214. In addition we’re conducting preclinical research to explore a combination regimen of NKTR-214 with an oral HDAC inhibitor
We’re also assessing other NKTR-214s small molecule combinations and collaborations to determine the best way to prioritize the many opportunities to address multiple molecular pathways in the context of the strong T cell activity provided by NKTR-214. As we achieve positive preclinical results for these initiatives we expect that we can advance some of these programs into the clinic as soon as the second half of this year
Another important landmark for our IO portfolio will be the entry into the clinic of our next IO candidate NKTR-262. NKTR-262 is our new TLR agonist small molecule, which is designed to activate the innate immune system and increase tumor antigen presentation
NKTR-262 will complement NKTR-214 and will give NKTR our first wholly owned IO combination regimen
We anticipate filing an IND for NKTR-262 by the end of 2017. Jonathan will discuss more in this strategy for development of NKTR-262 in combination with NKTR-214 later on the call
Now turning to our immunology program and in particular NKTR-358. We’re very excited about the imminent start of our first-in-human trial of NKTR-358 which is designed to stimulate the growth of the body’s own regulatory T cells
We submitted an IND for NKTR-358 at the end of February and we expect to initiate the first-in-human trial shortly
A medicine that treat autoimmune disease through stimulation of the body’s own processes to resolve over activation of the immune system has long been a goal in immunology
We know that the master cells of the immune system that control this resolution process are regulatory T cells
With the experience that we gained in the development of NKTR-214 and our ability to develop a medicine which activates the proliferation of TILs, we knew we could use our technology to harness the IL-2 pathway in the opposing way specifically expanding regulatory T cells and limiting the proliferation of T effector cells
Unlike current immunosuppressive agents which globally weaken the immune system to only address disease symptoms NKTR-358 could emerge as a first-in-class resolution therapeutic to correct the underlying pathology of autoimmune disease
The preclinical data for NKTR-358 are exceedingly promising
As you’ll recall we showed you impressive data in both non-human primates and models of antigen driven inflammation response
These data highlight NKTR-358’s potential to have a profound effect on a number of immune and inflammatory disorders including lupus, crohn’s disease, ulcer, colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, allergy, and graft-versus-host disease
With an asset that has this much broad potential and so many large indications, we believe the right strategy in order to maximize the value of NKTR-358 is to enter into a co-development and co-marketing partnership with a company that has a strong leadership position in immunology and shares our vision for the development of NKTR-358. As we advance NKTR-358 in the clinic this year, this will be a key objective for the program
With that, I’ll now hand the call over to Mary
Bert, this is Howard
I’ll let Mary handle the first part of your question and JZ will take the second part of your question
Well I think good question
I’ll let JZ give you some sense of mechanistically where the differences are, I can tell you that we’re probably at least a year ahead of that program, we will be in the clinic this month and I think we’ve designed what we believe is the best approach towards causing the proliferation of regulatory T cells and I’ll let JZ give you a sense of how we’ve achieved that
I’m glad you raised the issue of Celgene buying Delinia and you can see how important molecule that stimulate regulatory T cell production as oppose to suppressing the entire immune system and clearly the value that a program like that has in treating numerous diseases
So it certainly sets a standard for a molecule like NKTR-358 which as JZ said we believe is actually a much better approach to doing this
Yes, we can hear you
Unidentified Analyst Okay, good
Yes the root of indication of adding indications that was taken in the US with the initial approval to ages 12 and up, then the ages 12 and under in surgical settings
Are there plans to follow that same indication approval route in Japan, where there is already ages 12 and up and then as well for Europe where it currently under review
Yes and I think clearly I mean certainly talking from like Baxalta point of view and now Shire’s point of view, they would like to see ADYNOVATE the successor to ADVATE and it certainly makes sense, it’s a better molecule and we put a lot of effort into making sure that ADYNOVATE is the exact same molecule as ADVATE but long acting, it is full end ADVATE and that was done intentionally so that they could eventually switch over patients and maintain the dominant position in this space
Unidentified Analyst Great and then kind of piggybacking on the European aspect of that for ADYNOVATE
How quickly do you really anticipate the launch to ramp up once you do receive marketing approval in Europe?
Well I can’t speak for them directly, I imagine they would do it fairly quickly
It’s difficult for me to speak for Shire, but I would imagine that they’re very interested in getting as many patients on ADYNOVATE as quickly as possible
Unidentified Analyst Yes, great and nice work on the immunology pipeline
Well thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon
Of course I want to thank all our employees for their hard work and their dedication to the company this past year
As you can see from today’s call we have a number of milestones and catalyst coming up for Nektar over the next several quarters
The potential conditional approval for ONZEALD in Europe, the Phase 3 data for the bio programs, the Phase 3 data for NKTR-181 efficacy trial and of course data from the first 15 to 20 patients in the combination program of NKTR-214 with nivo and data from the first trial of NKTR-358 in lupus
So we very excited about this and we look forward to seeing many of you at the Cowen Conference next week
