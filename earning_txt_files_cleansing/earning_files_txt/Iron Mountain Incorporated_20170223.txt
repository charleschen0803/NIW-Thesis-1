Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone
I'm excited to be reporting on another strong quarter and the continued success of our operations team to grow our customer base and control costs
Before diving into the details, let me first quickly cover a couple of administrative items
To simplify our reporting, we have made certain terminology and definition changes
First, we are no longer using the term adjusted OIBDA and have replaced it with adjusted EBITDA
It's purely a terminology change
The measurement itself and historical numbers remain the same
EBITDA is easier for me to pronounce and simpler for new investors following the company
Second, we tweaked our future AFFO definition
Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we will eliminate the deduction of discretionary growth capital, which we refer to as innovation investment as well as add back all depreciation and amortization, which will be more consistent with how other REITs treat certain non-cash adjustments
More detailed explanations of these changes are on slide 17 of this presentation
Let's now turn to results
Our 2016 performance was generally in line with expectations as a result of the tremendous effort by the organization to successfully integrate Recall while delivering on our Transformation Initiative as Bill discussed
Before diving into the details, let me walk you through the key financial results of the quarter
First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.9% excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions
This is up from 2.1% in the third quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets
Second, we very effectively enhanced our profitability
Adjusted EBITDA margins improved to 31.7% with storage and service gross margin improvement, reflecting benefits from both Transformation and Recall synergies
Third, the integration of Recall continued on track, and we entered 2017 with a $65 million annual run rate of net synergies toward our target of $80 million to be realized in the year
Now, let me quickly review our full year 2016 results compared to our guidance on slide 10. Both on a reported dollar basis and on a 2016 constant dollar basis, performance was generally within the ranges of our guidance
The 2016 constant dollar budget rate was set in January 2016 and currency changes had a minor positive benefit in our reported results compared to budgeted rates
Revenue both on a reported basis and a 2016 constant dollar basis was squarely within guidance
AFFO came at the high end of our expectations as we leveraged our scale and optimized our capital expenditures
Approximately 80% of the capital expenditure reductions were permanent as we implemented more cost effective solutions or eliminated spending, while the remainder was deferred into 2017. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted EBITDA was within our range despite the lower overall profitability of the legacy Recall business
As we mentioned on prior calls, pre-acquisition, Recall had a lower margin profile compared to Iron Mountain's base business
Going forward, we continue to believe that we can optimize the legacy Recall business and bring it in line with our profitability levels
Adjusted EPS for the full year came in slightly below our guidance range due primarily to real estate depreciation, which does not impact FFO or AFFO being non-cash
Re-negotiations of several legacy Recall leases resulted in shorter asset lives than expected
Therefore, real estate depreciation was higher than anticipated
Let's now turn to slide 11 which shows our key financial metrics
Fourth quarter top-line growth of 24.2% was driven by acquisitions and strong internal storage revenue growth, slightly offset by foreign exchange headwinds compared to a year ago
The fourth quarter total revenue growth rate was slightly lower than the third quarter, reflecting divestitures
The internal storage rental growth in the fourth quarter of 2.9% was driven primarily by net internal records management volume growth of 1.7%
Internal volume growth was positive in all of our major markets
Service revenues increased 24.8% in the fourth quarter, but declined 0.9% on an internal basis primarily due to declines in transportation and handling activities as well as Western European service projects
As we've highlighted in previous calls, service business growth rates can fluctuate as on a relatively small basis and our mix is shifting towards more project-based revenues
We continue to focus on sustaining and gradually improving gross profits as services are complementary to our core records management and data storage businesses
The growth in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was driven by top line growth and acquisition benefits
In addition, we continued to benefit from our Transformation Initiative and Recall synergies
As a result, we've improved our adjusted EBITDA margins sequentially and year-over-year
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins improved from the third quarter by 50 basis points to 31.7%
Year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 10 basis points as we effectively leveraged SG&A costs despite headwinds from Recall's lower gross profit margin
The total gross profit margin continued to trend positively from Q3 as we realized Recall synergies and optimized operations
Compared to a year ago, the fourth quarter gross margin declined due to the mix of Recall's lower margins
Recall's gross margins as we've highlighted had higher rent expense, as pre-acquisition, at least close to 90% of their facilities
However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies to more than offset this gross margin decline resulting in the expansion of adjusted EBITDA margins
Let's turn quickly to slide 12 to cover financial performance by segment for the quarter
Before speaking to specific performance, it's important to understand the relative size of each segment and its contribution to the results
The pie chart on this slide shows the relative size of revenue to each business segment, split by storage and service
Storage provided more than 80% of our fourth quarter adjusted gross profit, while service provided less than 20%
While we continue to innovate on new service offerings for our customers, it is important to keep in mind the impact of service declines and increases
For example, North American data management service revenues are less than 4% of total revenues, so the overall North America data management business continues to be highly profitable with increasing margins
In North America records and information management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue growth continued to be strong
This performance was driven by price improvement and volume growth
The improvement we saw in the North American internal service revenue was partly driven by the on-boarding of a large retail customer in the shred business for whom we began providing ongoing destruction services in over 10,000 locations
In North America data management, we saw strong internal storage rental growth revenue of 3%, reflecting an improvement from the third quarter
However, service internal growth declined due to the ongoing reduction of tape rotation as we discussed previously
The adjusted EBITDA margin in North America DM increased over last year to 54.4%
The internal storage rental revenue growth in Western Europe has also improved from the third quarter
However, revenues were impacted by certain contract renegotiations that we mentioned on prior earnings calls
The Western European adjusted EBITDA margin declined year-over-year due to Recall's lower margin business, overhead costs which are not yet fully synergized and a reduction in service project revenue compared to a year ago
In the Other International segment, which now includes the larger legacy Recall Australian business, we continued to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth and improving margins
Before turning to our outlook for 2017, let me quickly touch on the composition of our global business
The first two pie charts on slide 13 reflect our revenue and adjusted EBITDA composition by U.S
dollar and other currencies based on fourth quarter results, which includes Recall's more global business
As you can see, roughly 60% of worldwide revenues are generated in the U.S
, and importantly close to 70% of adjusted EBITDA is in U.S
dollars
Therefore, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations may be more muted on adjusted EBITDA than many realize
Also, we have matched our foreign-denominated debt to create natural currency hedges to mitigate translation exposure, while also being tax efficient
As of year-end, 23% of our debt was in non-U.S
currencies
Let's turn to guidance for 2017 as summarized on page 14 of the deck
Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged
We expect storage rental growth of 2% to 2.5% and solid growth in our emerging markets and adjacent businesses
We refined 2017 guidance from our preliminary outlook presented in November due to negative currency impacts and finalizing our back-office shared service initiatives and innovation-related plans
Our guidance is now based on 2017 constant dollar budget rates, which reflects and holds constant January 2017 exchange rates
Next year, we plan to issue initial guidance in connection with our fourth quarter earnings call consistent with many of our peers
Our 2017 guidance also reflects the full-year impact of divestitures of legacy Iron Mountain businesses in Australia and Canada, which represent a full-year impact of approximately $47 million in revenues
Please note that 2017 guidance excludes Recall integration cost of approximately $135 million
For full-year 2017, at the midpoint, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow by 17.5% with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding about 200 basis points to around 33%
We remain confident with the Recall synergy expectations as we continue to successfully integrate the two businesses
Further, our guidance assumes we invest about $20 million in operating costs associated with innovation initiatives and global shared services programs that Bill mentioned
So not all of the savings from our Transformation program will flow through to the bottom line
These extra costs are expected to disproportionately hit the first quarter given our kickoff of the shared service programs
Please note that due to the rapid integration with Recall, it is difficult to isolate integration benefits from Transformation benefits, so we'll be reporting these benefits together through the improvement in our overall adjusted EBITDA margins
Also, I'd like to point out that we will no longer be guiding to FFO as we believe AFFO is more representative of the cash generation characteristics of our operating businesses and provides a better measure for dividend coverage
In 2017, AFFO is expected to grow by 11.5% at the midpoint compared to 2016 supporting our dividend growth
Included in AFFO is the expectation that maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments will be between $150 million and $170 million
Regarding allocation of capital to real estate ownership, we plan on optimizing our real estate portfolio through capital recycling
This means funding purchases through selling buildings in non-strategic locations while cap rates are at near all-time lows, and using the proceeds to purchase properties in more strategic locations
These types of programs enable us to take advantage of market pricing opportunities, enhance our utilization, and ensure we own properties in key markets
Our strategy remains to invest where the value creation is most compelling and reflects the best use of capital which generates the highest returns
Our guidance also assumes that we invest $160 million to $180 million in business acquisitions and acquisitions of customer relationships primarily building market share as we consolidate in our emerging markets
Turning to slide 15 and our cash available for distribution and investments, or CAD; for 2017, we expect CAD to cover our anticipated full-year dividend, required capital expenditures, core growth racking, and a portion of our discretionary investments
As a result, inherent in our guidance is an assumption that we would have approximately $125 million of capital available after funding the dividend to support core growth racking and other discretionary value-creating investments, and require $200 million of external funding for the remainder excluding Recall costs
Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we had liquidity of nearly $1 billion at year-end and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.7 times, which was in line with expectations
In the short-term, given the timing and proceeds of divestitures and investments related to innovation and shared services, we expect our leverage ratio to remain above long-term targeted levels and then trend down as we fully realize the synergies and Transformation benefits and continue internal growth
Overall, we are pleased with our 2016 performance and with the progress we've made integrating Recall and executing on Transformation
Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for the year
Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our high-margin storage rental business, and we're extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan, including capitalizing on value-creating growth investments and optimizing our costs and capital expenditures
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before Q&A
Hey, Kevin, this is Stuart
Yeah, over time it will
We still in 2017 will have a little bit I'll call it of above-average run rate
Some of that's just due to the maintenance that we've got on some of the Recall facilities that are flowing through in 2016 and 2017 and then after that it should be trending down
Yeah, Andrew
Again, you've got to remember, the service internal growth doesn't really have as big an impact as it flows through to gross profit in the bottom line, but flattish – it will be plus or minus 1% to 2%
Yeah, Shlomo, I think that if you're focused on EBITDA, I think maybe the simplest way to look at it is to start with the Q4 run rate that we've got, so we start with a Q4 run rate of just under $300 million and if you annualize that, that's going to get you to almost $1.2 billion, $1.188 billion
You got to remember in Q4 also we were having increasing synergies and Transformation benefits
So not all that flows through the quarter
So you have to annualize those benefits as well
That will get you about $40 million and you're going to have organic growth goes on in the business, right, every year
It's about 2%
And so that will get you about $25 million
Then you've got some incremental synergies that we've talked about, the difference between incremental synergies to be actioned in 2017, that's about $15 million and then you've got M&A activities that we have built in the guidance, which will give you about $10 million of EBITDA in 2017. You take all that together and you get to almost $1.280 billion when you add those up
And then we talked about the $20 million that we're going to be reinvesting back into shared services and innovation, that gets you close to $1.260 billion which is close to the midpoint of the guidance of $1.265 billion, that's the easiest way to sort of walk through the change from where we're going from 2016 into 2017.
If you're looking at guidance in November to guidance now, it's really the $20 million and the FX rate that had a negative impact as well
Those are the two main changes
You could be, but we've assumed in guidance right now that the paper prices stay consistent from 2016 – right, they're volatile
So we've assumed that 2016 stays on average flat with 2016 at about $140-$145 recycled (sic) [recycled sorted office] paper pricing
I mean, you'll start getting the return to the benefits from them really more in 2018. So you think about the back office shared services that Bill talked about
We'll have double running costs this year, so in 2018 those double running costs go away and then we start to take back office costs out
So those will continue to have benefits as well as the revenue growth that we expect and some of the other innovations will really start to benefit 2018 as well
It's going to be – yeah, what I'd tell you is that, and Bill sort of touched on it, we've really moved Transformation into a continuous program to really take cost out of the business, and improve capital deployment and keep growing the business
So what you'll do is, yeah, you should continue to see margin improvement in 2018 and 2019 as benefits from these in terms of, are we going to specifically call them out as Transformation benefits
I don't think we're going to sort of specify them that way
In risk of over answering this question, we could have staged it out to match funds, but the right answer for the business was to do HR and IT and finance all at the same time, and since you're doing all those at the same time, you've got more cost upfront and you'll get more of the benefits later on
Yeah, if you look at the revenue mix of the 2% to 2.5% storage and the flattish of service, you'll end up plus or minus 2%, unless you have an even number in front of me, because I think of them very differently because they are such different profit margins and such different drivers of the business
Yeah
I think over time you're going to continue to see us grow into the dividend, right, when we set the expectations for dividend growth out as part of our 2020 plan
That was always in anticipation of getting the synergies and Transformation benefits continuing to grow the business
And so, I think, yeah, so if you look at purely from what's required dividend for being a REIT, we're going to continue to return to shareholders more in dividends than is required, but we're going to grow into that over the next few years
I think the one distinction I've made is the really the real estate, the actual maintenance piece has been pretty well on track with guidance, is the non-real estate CapEx which includes things like back office IT systems at corporate and out in the field, warehouse equipment, that's where we've gone through and really sat down and said, what do we need to be investing in the business or is it better to repair than buy new as well as looking out over the next couple years in terms of system replacements, what can we not replace today and just sort of keep it going and because we're going to upgrade over the next couple of years
So we've gone through and sort of cleaned back or cut back some of the requests that have gone in that area
I think what you'll see us continue to do is on the maintenance side
Again, it'll be a little bit elevated in 2016 and 2017 because there is some deferred maintenance at Recall that we've got to do and that piece of it will trend down as a percentage of revenue or on a square foot basis
Yes
So when you look at the volume growth in the supplemental on slides 9 and 10, you'll see the overall trends increasing on new volume from existing customers and new sales, as well as destructions increasing as that volume comes in there, so that's the easiest place to see it
