Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Zions Bancorporation's Third
Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference
is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. James Abbott. You may begin.

James R. Abbott
Senior VP and Director of Investor Relations & External Communications

Thank you, Twanda, and good evening, everyone. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our
2021 third quarter earnings.

I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although
actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or
the slide deck on Slide 2, dealing with forward-looking information and the presentation of non-GAAP
measures, which apply equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the earnings release as well
as the slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com.

For our agenda today, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Harris Simmons, will provide operating
remarks -- opening remarks, followed by comments from Scott McLean, our President and Chief Operating
Officer. Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will conclude by providing additional detail on Zions'
financial condition. With us also today are Keith Maio, our Chief Risk Officer; and Michael Morris, our Chief
Credit Officer. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]

With that, I will turn the time over to Harris.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Thanks very much, James. We want to welcome all of you to our call. Beginning on Slide 3, the themes
that are particularly applicable to Zions, both recently as well as we believe in the near-term horizon, are
listed here. We are seeing continued strong deposit growth, continued in the third quarter. This positions
Zions well relative to many of our peers to be able to invest in securities and to offer promotions on loan
products and core customer segments.

Secondly, for more than a decade, we worked to position the company to perform very well during an
economic downturn. We are really pleased with the results, which you see in our credit outcomes again
this quarter.

Third, we, along with most in the industry, have experienced net attrition of loan balances, excluding PPP
loans. But over the last quarter, we started to see some new commercial loan growth, and our strong
deposit growth enabled us again to launch some promotional campaigns in June that have resulted in
favorable initial results.

These customers are coming from other banks, and we've also seen new demand from existing customers.
All of it is accretive to net interest income relative to leading liquidity and money market accounts and
all of it is helpful to our goal of generating positive operating leverage. We're well positioned for rising
interest rates, which is helped by strong deposit growth, but also reflects the careful deployment of
liquidity during earlier more uncertain points in time.

As the outlook becomes more certain, we have begun to deploy the liquidity into higher-yielding assets.
The final item on this slide refers to our ongoing significant investment in technology, which is designed to
enable Zions to remain very competitive in the future, both relative to the largest U.S. banks, with fintechs
and with well-established community banks.

2021

Turning to Slide 4. We are pleased with the results on most fronts. Our campaigns on owner-occupied
commercial loans as well as consumer home equity lines of credit resulted in strong growth in both
categories, each increasing at an annualized rate exceeding 10% relative to the prior quarter. Excluding
PPP loans, our period-end loans in total increased an annualized 5.6%. Deposit growth remained very
strong, up an annualized 9.3%, moderately outpacing the growth in the industry, which includes all
domestic commercial banks. Over the prior year, deposit growth was 16%, which compares to the
industry's rate of 12%.

It is particularly notable that credit quality continued to improve, again, reporting net loan recoveries and
a nearly 30% decline in special mention loans from the prior quarter. These, along with other factors, led
to a further release of loan loss reserves.

We indicated last quarter that we would continue to increase the size of the securities portfolio at a rate
greater than what we did in 2020. And in the third quarter, we increased the size of the securities portfolio
by nearly $2.3 billion or 12%, and that's not annualized, that's relative to the prior quarter. Diluted
earnings per share decreased to $1.45 per share from $2.08 in the prior quarter. There were 2 primary
factors that accounted for the decline: the change in the provision expense and the change in the gains,
losses on securities. Combined, those 2 contributed about $0.76 per share less in the third quarter as
compared to the second.

One way we, and perhaps some of you, look at our earnings is to look at adjusted pre-provision net
revenue, which excludes securities gains and losses, and subtracting from that actual net charge-offs. On
that basis, it was unchanged relative to the prior quarter of $290 million.

Turning to Slide 5. At the top left is the chart of our recent earnings per share results. The chart on the
bottom left shows the per share amount for the provision for credit losses during that same period. The
provision effect on earnings per share was quite variable throughout the pandemic and is a major factor
in the linked quarter decline in earnings per share. On the right side are some notable items that may
be of interest. As previously noted, unrealized losses from securities left a partial offset from a reduced
success fee accrual to the SBIC fund manager, equaled $0.12 per share as compared to unrealized gains
of $0.25 per share in the prior quarter. Most of the recent gains and losses on securities are attributable to
an investment in small business investment company fund.

One of the companies within the fund successfully completed an IPO in April, which we described in our
first quarter 10-Q, with a strong unrealized gain in the second quarter followed by a partial retracement in
the third quarter.

On Slide 6, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics. The healthy results were attributable to
items that I previously described. As previously noted, another significant highlight for the quarter was the
credit quality of the loan portfolio, as illustrated on Slide 7. Relative to the prior quarter, we saw further
improvement in problem loans using the broadest definition of problem loans, criticized and classified
loans dropped more than 17%. Although not shown relative to the prior quarter, special mention loans
declined at 29% and classified loans declined 10%.

Many of you have seen our slide in the past showing our average net charge-off ratio relative to average
nonperforming assets plus -- 90-plus days past due loans, which is an indicator of loss severity. And chart
of this metric relative to our peers can be seen in the appendix. During the 5 years ending 2020, our
average annual loss severity was 15%, while the peer median was 32%. Over the last 12 months, that
ratio for Zions is just 6%. We experienced net credit recoveries on loans, which was also true in the prior
quarter.

Perhaps one of the more interesting credit measures to highlight this quarter is that gross charge-offs
were very low, $8 million or just 7 basis points and annualized of average non-PPP loans. Shown on the
chart on the bottom right, one can see the volatility of the provision contrasted with the relative stability
of net charge-offs. This is mostly the result of changing economic forecasts.

Our capital position is depicted on Slide 8. We increased our share buyback to $325 million in the third
quarter and have indicated that ultimately, we expect to target a common equity Tier 1 ratio at a level

moderately above the peer median. We expect to announce any capital actions for the fourth quarter in
conjunction with our regularly scheduled Board meeting this coming Friday.

Next, Scott McLean, our President and Chief Operating Officer, is going to provide an update on the PPP
program and our technology initiatives. Scott?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Thank you, Harris. Turning to Slide 9, our third quarter adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $290
million, net of the effects of the previously noted IPO. The PPNR bars are split into 2 portions. The bottom
portion represents what we think of as generally recurring income, while the top portion denotes the PPNR
we've received from PPP loans.

During the course of the Paycheck Protection Program, our performance were producing, on a relative
basis, 3x more than the industry average, will result in approximately $460 million in additional income to
the company, which represents capital that ultimately benefits all shareholders. To be specific, PPP-related
revenue has equaled $380 million and there remains $83 million in capitalized income, net of origination
costs that will be recognized over time. Although PPP-related revenue will decline, we're enthusiastic about
the longer-term benefit of adding approximately 20,000 small business customers and strengthening
relationships with 57,000 existing customers.

Turning to Slide 10, reflects some of the highlights from our 3x performance that I noted earlier. Regarding
forgiveness, we've received $7.9 billion of applications or nearly 80% of the total volume; $6.7 billion has
been approved for forgiveness by the SBA; and $3.1 billion of PPP loans remain on our balance sheet at
quarter end.

Turning to Slide 11, this slide illustrates the longer-term benefit of this activity, specifically as a result of
our outreach. You see growing relationships with many of the 77,000 PPP participating customers. These
customers collectively have contributed approximately $6 billion of our deposit growth and new non-
PPP loan balances exceed $550 million to this collection of customers. More specifically, the PPP 2020
vintage, the spring 2020 vintage, 14,000 new-to-bank customers, approximately 54% are now appear to
be utilizing us as their primary -- for their operating accounts. This percentage, as we've noted previously,
has been growing nicely each quarter, and we are seeing similar growth trends with the PPP 2021 vintage
of 5,000 new-to-bank customers, which started earlier this year.

Turning to Slide 12, recall that in our investor presentations, we provide a detailed slide of our major
technology projects. Today, we want to just highlight two. Many of you may recall, in April, FDIC Chair
Jelena McWilliams, was quoted as saying that her #1 concern for the banking industry was its reliance on
aging core loan and deposit systems.

So where do we stand on this topic? As of February 2019, you'll recall that we completed the replacement
of our 3 legacy core loan systems and now have virtually all of our loans on our new modern core. In
2023, we expect to complete the final phase of our core modernization journey with the conversion from
our legacy deposit systems to our new enterprise core system.

To put this in perspective, a big 4 accounting firm recently reported that of the top 100 banks in the
United States, 93 remain on one or more older first-generation cores, 6 are utilizing a modern core on
only a portion of their loan and deposit ecosystem, and Zions is the only bank approaching the ability to
utilize a modern core for the entire enterprise. Interestingly, you were starting to hear about some digital-
first core systems. While these provide the most advanced architectural elements available and we're
generally designed for digital-only banks, none have yet to be proven usable on a scale or complexity
required by the largest banks.

So why does this matter? At a high level, implementation of one core solution across all lines of
business, all products and all geographies greatly reduces complexity, enhances our resiliency and
creates adaptability for a rapidly changing technology environment that lies ahead. More specifically, the
architecture is, as noted on this slide, parameter-driven, meaning we can quickly turn off and on or adjust
features without reprogramming or testing for months. It utilizes one data model, a huge advantage in the

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 18,
2021

digital world, and it is natively real-time and API-enabled. This collection of characteristics and others will
greatly reduce the time it takes to introduce new products and capabilities.

As an example, our new core was an important contributor to producing PPP revenue exceeding $460
million. Within a matter of days, we were able to introduce the PPP product and increase the number
of business-related loans on our system from approximately 40,000 to over 95,000, with loan boarding
occurring in minutes. Most would agree this represents a significant early return on our core replacement
investment. As you talk to other banks, they will say that their older first-generation core loan and deposit
systems have been adapted to mimic real-time, utilize APIs and synthesize dozens of data models. Well,
we were doing that as well in our loan systems and continue to do that in our deposit system until we
convert.

But all of these technologies, all of these technology gymnastics that take place generally in what is
referred to as middleware, absolutely introduce complexity, risk and cost. Regarding one additional
highlight, I'd like to note that our core system's 7-day processing capability. Most of the world outside the
United States operates on 7-day processing. When we implemented the loan portion of our new core, we
adopted 7-day processing. However, as the U.S. deposit market has still not adopted 7-day processing, we
chose to convert back to 5-day processing in advance of our 2023 deposit conversion. The point is that we
were literally able to turn this global capability off over a weekend in August and can turn it back on when
the U.S. adopts 7-day processing. This slide also conveys numerous other customer and employee-facing
benefits, which I'd be happy to expand on in Q&A.

Turning to Slide 13, my last slide. While we have been highly focused on our industry-leading work
regarding core modernization, I wanted to highlight one of our numerous new customer-facing
capabilities. Earlier in the year, we converted 610,000 consumers to our new online mobile platform.
While time does not allow us to review all the details of this new platform, we are gratified with the early
acceptance by consumers as measured by ratings in the Apple app and Google app stores. You can see
that we are on par with the largest U.S. banks and are top tier with our peers. The rollout of this new
online mobile system to approximately 150,000 small business clients will occur in 2022. And with this
client base, we are already perceived to be on par with or superior to our global competitors.

With that, I'll turn the remainder of the time over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Scott, and good evening, everyone, and thanks for joining us. More than 3/4 of our revenue
is in the form of net interest income, which is significantly influenced by loan and deposit growth and
associated interest rates. As such, I'll begin my comments on Slide 14 with a review of these results.
Although the average total loans were down in the third quarter by 3.7% when compared to the second
quarter, we experienced average loan growth when excluding PPP loans. And on a period-end basis, that
growth was $661 million or 1.4%. The strongest linked-quarter growth was in commercial construction at
nearly $270 million. This is the result of increased construction activity on previously established lines of
credit.

We reported strength in commercial and industrial loans, which increased more than $280 million or 2%.
We ran promotions during the quarter on owner-occupied and home equity loans, which increased $215
million and $107 million, respectively. Declines were reported in PPP loans, down $1.4 billion, as Scott
previously noted, and term commercial real estate, which declined more than $220 million.

In the third quarter, we reported a more modest decline in residential mortgage balances than we have in
recent quarters, down nearly $130 million. With a strong held for investment pipeline of mortgages, we
may see some further stabilization or possibly growth in residential mortgages in the near term.

One final note on loan growth, relative to periods prior to the pandemic, revolving line of credit utilization
has declined several percentage points. Using the third quarter of 2019 as the benchmark quarter, our
revolving line utilization rate was 39.5% as compared to 33.7% in the third quarter of 2021, which was

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 18,
2021

essentially from the prior quarter. Although revolving loan balances did increase from the prior quarter, up
about $200 million, the lending commitments increased about $700 million.

As I've noted in the past, deposits have been and remain the driver of balance sheet growth over the
past several quarters and in the third quarter. On the right side of this page, average deposits increased
3.7% from the prior quarter. Relative to the year ago period, average deposits increased 16%. Average
noninterest-bearing deposits increased 4.9% over the prior quarter and 24% compared to the prior year
period.

Our noninterest-bearing deposits make up 1/2 of average total deposits. The yield on average total loans
increased slightly from the prior quarter, which is attributable to the 6.7% yield on the PPP loan portfolio.
Excluding PPP loans, the yield declined 8 basis points to 3.59% from 3.67%. Deposit costs remain low.
Our cost of total deposits fell to 3 basis points in the third quarter.

Moving to Slide 15, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last 5
quarters. The size of the period-end securities portfolio increased by nearly $6 billion over the past year
to $21 billion, while money market investments increased more than $7.5 billion to $11.9 billion. The
combination of securities and money market investments has risen to nearly 40% of total earning assets
at period end, which compares to an average level in 2019 prior to the pandemic of 26%.

We continue to exercise caution regarding duration extension risk by purchasing bonds with relatively
short duration, both in the current and in an upward shock -- rate shock scenario. The $3.6 billion of
security purchases for the quarter had an average yield of 1.53%.

Slide 16 is an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart in the left shows the
recent 5-quarter trend for both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has declined over the past
year, reflecting the rise in excess liquidity as described on the prior page. For the third quarter, this growth
in excess liquidity is referenced in the chart on the right as the strong growth in deposits has impacted
the composition of earning assets through a larger concentration in lower-yielding money market and
securities investments.

The weighted average yield of our securities and money market investments is just 1.07%. And with that
concentration increasing by 4 percentage points in the quarter, it weighed on the net interest margin. In
fact, I estimate that the increase in money market investments has accounted for 33 of the 45 basis point
net interest margin compression over the past year.

Slide 17 shows information about our interest rate sensitivity. Focusing on the upper left quadrant as
a general statement, our asset sensitivity has increased as deposits have been invested in short-term
money market assets. This increase in estimated rate sensitivity assumes that the incremental deposits
have modestly shorter duration characteristics when compared to deposits on our balance sheet prior to
the recent deposit surge. We are continuing to deploy deposit-driven cash into securities, which helps
to moderate the natural asset sensitivity. However, with continued strong deposit growth and higher
prepayment rates on mortgage loans and securities, our estimated interest rate sensitivity was similar
to the second quarter level, such that in an interest rate environment that is shocked immediately 100
basis points higher than the current level, our net interest income at a 12-month horizon is estimated to
be higher by 12%.

As previously noted, we may continue to add interest rate swaps, including forward-starting swaps, which
would help to temper our natural asset sensitivity.

On Slide 18, building on a good second quarter, customer-related fees increased an additional 9% in
the third quarter to $151 million. Notably, activity-based fees such as card fees, merchant services and
retail and business banking fees remain strong and have grown to the level of 2 years ago prior to the
pandemic. This improvement added to continued strength in loan-related capital markets and wealth
management revenues.

Noninterest expenses on Slide 19 were essentially unchanged from the prior quarter at $429 million.
Adjusted noninterest expense increased 3% or $13 million to $432 million. The linked-quarter increase in

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 18,
2021

adjusted noninterest expense was primarily due to employee compensation. The increase was associated
with higher base salaries and profitability-driven long- and short-term compensation.

Other noninterest expense includes a $4 million success fee reversal associated with the mark-to-market
loss in our SBIC as compared to the $9 million success fee accrual recognized in the second quarter.

Slide 20 details our allowance for credit losses or ACL. In the upper left, we show the recent declining
trend in the ACL to $529 million at the end of the third quarter or 1.11% of non-PPP loans. The chart on
the lower right side of this page shows the 3 broad categories that resulted in a decline of $45 million.
More than 60% of the change was attributable to changes in the portfolio mix and composition.

Our updated outlook is found on Slide 21. And as a reminder, this is our outlook for financial performance
in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the actual results reported for the third quarter of 2021.
The quarters in between are subject to normal seasonality, and my comments are subject to our earlier
reference to forward-looking statements found on Slide 2.

Due to the degree of uncertainty on the timing of customer submitting requests and the SBA approving
those requests, our outlook for loan growth excludes PPP loans. We are more optimistic about loan
growth now than we were in July, and as such, we are increasing our outlook to moderately increasing
from slightly to moderately increasing, led by core C&I, including our promotional owner-occupied loan
product. We expect net interest income, also excluding PPP loan revenue, to increase over the next year
as compression of loan and securities yields will be more than offset by continued deployment of cash into
term securities and our more favorable outlook for growth in non-PPP loans.

The current quarter's customer-related fees are the highest we have reported. Building on such a strong
third quarter, we are reducing our outlook for customer-related fees 1 year from now to be stable to
slightly increasing from moderately increasing. We are adjusting our expectation for adjusted noninterest
expense to be moderately increasing from slightly increasing. We remain disciplined on expense control.
However, increased business activity, emerging inflationary trends and continued investment in enabling
technologies will place upward pressure on noninterest expense over the near term.

And finally, with respect to capital management, we remain comfortable that our philosophy of lower-
than-average risk, combined with stronger than median capital, is the right formula for creating long-term
shareholder value. Our capital measured by common equity Tier 1 relative to risk-weighted assets remains
well above the peer median. As we consider the balance between capital ratios and our risk profile, we
believe that we have capacity for continued active capital management in the near to medium term, so
long as the current macroeconomic and credit trends continue to be favorable.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Twanda, please open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of
America.

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

I was wondering, Paul, if you could just unpack the NII guide a little bit. Just help us understand in terms
of what are you assuming, in terms of the -- how much cash you expect to deploy into securities over the
next 12 months, where you see that liquidity levels going? And does the increasing imply 4% to 6% or
somewhat higher in the high single-digit range, when we think about the growth year-over-year?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sorry, I missed the second part of your question on 4% to 6%. What was that question?

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes. I was just -- increasing, does that imply mid-single digits or high single-digits NII growth?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Right. Sorry. So first, let me talk about deposits because that's really the driver here, right? We have had
-- deposits across the industry are up. I think we have been able to garner more than our fair share of
deposits. And as we are analyzing these deposits over time, what we're finding is a year ago, I would have
thought that these deposits were more transitory to borrow or from the Fed than they're proving to be.

What we're actually observing is that many of these new deposit accounts are being used in an operating
nature, which history tells us means that they're more sticky than they otherwise would be. So this is
what's giving us confidence to be, I don't want to say aggressive, but certainly buying more securities
than we might otherwise would, i.e. putting those deposit dollars to work.

So as we're thinking about our net interest income outlook next year, and again, remember, this excludes
PPP loans, right? So taking them out of the base and not considering them going forward. But we have
increased confidence that loan growth will pick up and so we're going to use part of the cash that way.
And as that cash continues to prove to be somewhat stable, that is if the deposits continue to prove to be
somewhat stable, we will continue to deploy that in investment securities.

We -- our asset-sensitive position is such that we can afford to continue to add duration on the asset side
for some time to come, without really adversely impacting our risk profile. In fact, I would argue it kind of
improves our risk profile as we reduce volatility. So it's those key factors. It's the continued deployment of
securities and growth in loans that we believe will ultimately drive growth in net interest income over the
course of the next year, excluding PPP.

Ebrahim Huseini Poonawala
BofA Securities, Research Division

That was helpful. And does that imply mid-single digits or high single-digit NII growth?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, we have a tendency to not try to put dollars on it, but generally speaking, increasing would be mid to
above mid.

Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

I was just wondering on the liquidity front, what the minimum cash level you want to hold either as a
balance or a percent of assets? Just trying to figure out how much excess cash you think you have that
you can deploy in the securities?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So Dave, so it depends on what we're assuming for deposits, right? Everything is centered around
those. As we gain confidence in those deposits, that amount of sort of cash we need to hold for what I
would characterize, as a liquidity risk, can go down. And what we're seeing is that, as I said, the stability
of that cash appears to be improving.

If you look back over time, you can see that it would not be uncommon at all for us to run with a sort
of cash position, i.e., the money market investments line on our balance sheet of kind of $2 billion to $3
billion. And in fact, a year ago, that's where it was. So I wouldn't -- as we gain confidence in the stability
of those deposits, I would expect -- and I should also add that there is an enormous amount of liquidity
in our investment portfolio. So we're investing relatively short. What that means is that we've got about
$400 million of cash flow every month that we're continuing to reinvest. So when we think about our cash
position, it's not only cash on the balance sheet, but the cash flow that's churning through the investment
portfolio.

So a long way of saying that, if you look historically, we have run with a cash position that's much, much
lower than today. And over time, I would expect to get back to something closer to that.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just switching gears to the loans on the teaser rate products. Just curious where those
rates are today, what they step up to in a year or so? And then what's your appetite is for total production
there? How long do you think you're going to run those? Any details there would be great.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Yes. Thank you, Dave. This is Scott McLean. The home equity line of credit program we ran from June 1
to the end of August, and that rate was 90 basis points for the first year and then it converted to 2 99 to
the extent they were new loans, out to 10 years. And similarly, on the owner-occupied program that also
started June 1. And it's tentatively scheduled to conclude at the end of this year. That promotional rate
was 90 basis points and it converts out to 10 years from there, another 9 years at 2 99.

We will probably, depending on what happens with the rate environment, have each of our affiliates on
a cycling basis, keep that HELOC promotion live. And likewise, if we get to the end of the year and the
rate environment seems still very flat to stable, we may continue the owner-occupied program for a bit
longer as well. Both have been -- we've been really pleased with the energy that both have generated and
more than the loans that they produce, it's given all of our bankers something really exciting to talk about
during a pretty challenging time. And so it's been a really good strategy for us.

I wanted to ask just two questions on the asset sensitivity. Can you just remind us what percentage of
loans have floors? And how many Fed rate hikes you need to go above those loans floors?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

James, do we still have that on the slide off the top of my head? I think we might have to give the
percentage. Do you have it handy, James?

James R. Abbott
Senior VP and Director of Investor Relations & External Communications

Yes, I'll get it by the end of the call, Peter. It's $6 billion or $7 billion, as I recall, but well, let me find the
number really quickly.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Okay.

James R. Abbott
Senior VP and Director of Investor Relations & External Communications

And it's only about 50 basis points or so in the money. So it's not a huge move. And I guess my final
thought on that would be is that it is incorporated in our interest rate sensitivity outlook. So as we think
about an up 100 scenario, that is incorporated in that.

Peter J. Winter
Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division

Got it. And I'm just wondering about the deposit betas. I saw on the slide what your forecast is. I'm just
wondering if the deposit betas come in lower. I'm just wondering if there's any type of sensitivity analysis
just given how much growth you've had in noninterest-bearing deposits.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Well, we certainly do a lot of sensitivity analysis, and I think we have some in -- that we published
quarterly in our 10-Q. I think there's a couple of key assumptions in there. One is that the duration of the
deposits that we've recently put on is actually a little shorter than the duration of sort of the, what I might
call, the heritage portfolio of deposits. That's one point. And the other point is there's so much liquidity
in the market that we believe that when rates start to rise, we do not believe we will need to be very
aggressive in raising rates, perhaps less than historically perhaps. And that feeds into our asset sensitivity.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

And on the question about loans with floors, we have about $35 billion plus or minus in variable rate loans
and about $24 billion, these numbers are not exactly at September 30, but about $24 billion have floors
and the floors are generally at 0 or rates, say, 100 basis points higher than that.

Jennifer Haskew Demba

Question on the loan loss reserve, now down to 122 basis points of non-PPP loans. Just wondering, given
the economy should continue to improve and it sounds like you're pretty confident your loan losses are

Paul E. Burdiss

Go ahead, Harris.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Well, it sounds like a game of Limbo, how low could you go. I think as the very nature of CECL is
everything that we think about the future of that reserve is incorporated into it. But if we look, if we saw
a permanent -- I don't think that the -- what we're seeing right now in terms of credit quality with -- you
mentioned gross charge-offs coming in at 7 basis points is probably a sustainable -- or even where we
should be.

But if we found that we're just -- that the losses are not materializing, then it will continue, I presume,
to come lower. I don't think there's any -- there's no sort of arbitrary limit or threshold or anything of the
sort. I mean we're just doing our best every quarter to try to understand what future losses inherent in
that portfolio going to look like over the life of the underlying loans. So I think it's a tough question to
answer, in theory, I think it can come lower. I'm not sure I would really expect it, again, just given the
nature of the portfolio and the times we're in.

Jennifer Haskew Demba
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Second question is on your lending pipeline. Could you just talk about the pipeline outside the promotions
that you had during the quarter and what you're seeing in terms of demand right now?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Sure. Jennifer, this is Scott. As you think about the categories, Paul noted our utilization rate and on
revolving credits. And I think it's reasonable to expect, and that's just generally C&I credits principally,
but it has some consumer and some CRE related to it. And I think our general thought is over the next 12
months, we'll see revolving usage start to go up again. I don't think we have to work through all this cash.

If you go back to the 2008, 2009, the monetary easing then, that liquidity fundamentally saved in the
system and utilization rates, we're not overly burdened by that. So customers just got used to dealing
with a higher level of liquidity. Secondly, I would say that our municipal finance business is continuing to
grow nicely. We're seeing increases in other C&I pipelines related to larger transactions, syndications, et
cetera.

And CRE in general, I wouldn't look for CRE to grow faster than our portfolio grows, but CRE in general,
has been growing nicely. And finally, One of the places where we've seen the most decreases in our
portfolio has been in 1-4 family mortgages. And based on the mix of that portfolio -- the mix of that
pipeline, excuse me, we should start to see 1-4 family growing again. If you look back over the last 5
or 6 years before the pandemic, 1-4 family mortgage products were generally about 20% to 25% of our
growth. And I don't think it's unreasonable to think but that will return as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I just want to ask on capital. This quarter, you guys did the extra step up and still had room to grow
loans, and you've talked to us about trying to get your CET1 ratio down over time, closer to peers and
directionally. So I guess what's the trade-off now if you're starting to see a little bit better loan growth

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 18,
2021

with regards to how fast the pace of capital return could be in that kind of waiting or hoping or expecting
the loan growth to come back in terms of RWA usage?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I'll start with that, Ken. The fact is we reported an estimated CET1 at 10.9% this quarter. I think you
know that we compare -- we have a list of peers, which we publish, and we compare our CET1 to those of
peers. And we remain sort of significantly above that median peer level.

Over time, as we have said, we expect to have lower-than-average risk and slightly better than median
capitalization. And therefore, we've got some room to go on that ratio. So my point of saying that is that
we can absolutely absorb accelerating loan growth and continued share repurchases. But as a reminder, as
Harris noted that, that capital activity is subject to Board approval.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then, Scott, another good update on future core and the timing. And I guess we're still waiting
for that time period when you get that double spend out of the way. So how much closer are we to
starting to sunset some of the older stuff? Is there -- are you still expecting costs to go up? So I'm just
wondering the ins and outs in terms of the moderately increasing cost base you're still expecting from
here versus when do we really start to see some of those synergies from the platform.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Yes. Thank you for that question. Pretty similar to what we said during the third quarter and earlier in the
year, the future core-related P&L costs will actually be kind of flat to down a little bit next year. It should
increase in '23 by about $7 million to $10 million, $10 million over our current run rate just because that
is the implementation year, and you'll generally see expenses go up because of accounting treatment
there. And then in '24, it will drop about $10 million, so to kind of put a fine point on your question.

I would, however, note that when you think about overall technology spend, and we've said this for a long
time, it -- I don't know that it's going to abate for many reasons. The investments that all banks need to
make in cyber protection, the investments you have to make to be cloud-ready and utilize the benefits of
cloud, the investments you need to make around data, et cetera. And so I don't know that, that's where
you'll see it. where I think you'll see it will be in operational expenses. And as we continue to see the
benefits of the system, it will come in operational expenses, not necessarily in technology spend.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

In terms of my first question, Scott, responding to Jennifer's question, the one area that you didn't really
touch on was energy, which I'd imagine you could probably get good risk-adjusted returns given most
banks are still restricting exposure there. So the question, do you guys have an appetite for energy
lending here? And are you seeing increased demand just given the surge in energy prices overall?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

The answer is yes. And yes, if I can say that without being politically insensitive, the -- our energy loans
outstanding are about $1.9 billion right now. You'll recall that we got down to about this level after the
2015, 2016 energy price volatility period. And then we were able to grow back up to about $2.5 billion,
and now we've run back down to about $1.9 billion.

At these prices, which were predictable for both oil and natural gas, we will start to see drilling increase.
And you will see line utilization going up, and there are far fewer players today. The -- and the market
pricing has gone up on reserve-based loans, and credit quality structures have improved, they were not
bad before, but they've become more conservative.

As the number of banks globally and particularly in the U.S., has shrunk by probably half, that we'll do
energy financing today from kind of 25% to 30% down to sort of the mid-teens. We'll continue to see
some midstream growth. Basically, the portfolio is about 40%, 45% upstream reserve-based loans, which
is what we specialize in, about a similar position of about 40% for midstream and a smaller percentage
around 15% for oilfield service.

But Steven, you're absolutely right. We will see growth there. We anticipate it. We're feeling it. And to go
back to $2.5 billion or slightly higher, would not be an unreasonable expectation over the next 1.5 years.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That's really helpful color. Separately, if I look at Slide 13, Scott, can you give more color on what
customers responded to so favorably that drove the increase in the App Store ratings?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Yes. That's a great question. It's -- when you look at it -- well, first of all, our ratings were not very
favorable before. So they may be reacting to, hey, it just is a whole lot better. But they're ranking us on a
level, as I said, very close to the global banks, which are clearly terrific in this regard, and top tier for our
peer banks. And it really is the items noted there.

But we have a unified platform for online and mobile. That may sound kind of simple but a lot don't. And it
means that you have to constantly be synchronizing your online and mobile products. It's one platform for
us now. The alert option, particularly are attractive when you think about fraud and the increase of fraud
in our environment.

And I would also note that this is just the start for us. We can now push upgrades, new capabilities daily
if we want, okay? That's a huge difference from where we were. We can now push daily if we like. And
we have a really tight punch list of enhancements that we didn't make part of the initial offering that we'll
roll out over the next 12 months, which we think will do nothing but support these favorable ratings and
possibly increase them.

Steven A. Alexopoulos
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, we looked. It's pretty high across all of the sub banks too, pretty consistent there.

Scott J. McLean

lending has been picking up, have you been evaluating your hold levels on that front? Just looking at
different ways that you can capitalize on some of this improvement in demand that you're mentioning.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Just a quick -- I'll just give you a quick answer. Harris, go ahead.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

John, I'd say that I don't think -- we're not going to allow it to get into our thinking about hold limits. Let
me start there. I think that's just -- that's really an important kind of risk management consideration, not
one that's -- we're going to let revenue drive.

I'm comfortable with where our limits are, but I don't want to conflate how we use this liquidity to justify
taking on a lot more risk. I think the we may find ourselves looking at other opportunities in terms of how
we use promotional pricing. I think a big consideration is just systemically how we can support products,
where we introduced pricing. And some are simply easier because of the nature of a fixed rate or a term
deal where you know that it's going to be outstanding for a period of time. You can have a teaser rate for
the first portion. But no, you're pretty confident that you're going to get a sizable annuity in the out years.

That's not always true with some other loan types, which can be shorter term in nature and a little more
challenging to manage in terms of making sure that ultimately this is going to provide some really solid
benefit for us. So anyway, I appreciate the comment, something we should think about. But I think the
capital products that we've focused this on are probably the right ones at the present time.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. No, that's helpful. And then separately, Harris, just you've been discussing your capital optionality.
And I just wondered if I can get your updated thoughts around M&A. We've seen a number of your
bank peers complete deals, and there's been a bit of a race here to gain scale on what's clearly a highly
competitive space. So curious of your thoughts there as you look at potential M&A, either bank or nonbank
as well?

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think our thinking hasn't really changed relative to bank M&A. I don't think that you can win this
race by just getting larger, bigger isn't better, better is better, absolutely the way we think about this.
There could be deals that make sense. There's a lot of deals that probably don't. We continue to be, I
think, pretty cautious about any activity, given that all the internal focus we have on getting this future
core project behind us.

As we emerge from that, I think we'll have certainly an opportunity to do things that would be appealing
to customers, and that will provide some capabilities that might be incrementally enticing to sellers. But
at the end of the day, we just want to get through that project, clear our minds and then look at the
economics of what's out there. And if they make sense, if they -- particularly in market consolidation that
improves incrementally economics, that's something we'd certainly look at. But it's not going to be a driver
of our -- it's not -- strategically, it's not something that's kind of front burner for us.

Gary Peter Tenner

I apologize. So my first question is just a quick one on PPP. It looks like about 1/3 of the remaining
balances have forgiveness applications already in. Could you kind of ballpark where you think the year-
end level could be, given that there's still a sizable amount of fees to be collected split between the fourth
quarter and next year?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Gary, this is Paul. It's pretty speculative. I mean we've -- it's not only -- it's not up to us, right? Because
the clients need to submit for it, and then the SBA needs to act on it. So my expectation is largely that
PPP loans, it's going to have sort of probably a half-life aspect to it. But I'd say the vast majority of our
loans are going to be gone by the middle of next year, is my personal estimate. But again, it's pretty
speculative.

Gary Peter Tenner
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then, Scott, if I heard your answer to the question on rate sensitivity and floors
correctly, it was $35 billion in variable rate loans, $24 billion of which have floors. And did you say that the
floors are generating the money by less than 100 basis points? Or was that a different figure?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

James made the comment about in the money. And what I failed to say was the LIBOR floors are -- were
generally at 1%, some as low as 0. The prime floors are at 3.25% to 4%. That was the guidance. And I
think James made a comment about what was in the money.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Can I clarify that just a little bit, Scott? The number of loans with floors in the money is $5.6 billion, and
the average in the money, moneyness we call it, is just over 50 basis points. It's about 60 basis points.
As Scott correctly pointed out, we have a lot of loans with floors that are kind of out of the money. I think
your question is really about the in-the-money floors, and it's that $5.6 billion and about 60 basis points.

Just want to make sure I understand the remixing strategy that has the potential to unfold. I guess
the question is, what is the kind of the level of securities to earning assets that you would anticipate as

proportionately?

Executive VP & CFO

Well, look, I want to grow -- and I think we all want to grow loans first and foremost, and we're all very,
very focused on that. And so that loan growth is going to be the driver, and that's our anchor, right?
Everything around that is how we invest our deposits into earning assets. And so first and foremost is
loans. And then second priority would be securities. And again, it's relatively short term.

So to the extent these deposits stay sticky, the answer is going to be, first, we'll fund the loans and then
sort of whatever is left over, leaving a kind of a storehouse of cash for immediate liquidity will over time be
invested into longer-term securities. I hope that's helped. It's a little -- I know it's not precise, but that's
the thought process. And so as you're thinking about the balance sheet and modeling it, that's -- I would
encourage you to use that sort of thought process.

Christopher Edward McGratty
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And maybe I could just ask one in terms of the guidance. I'm just -- I want to make
sure I understand the outlook. Could you just maybe provide a key or kind of a little bit more guidance on
each of the outlook moderating, increasing, increasing? I know you don't tend to give specifics, but just
kind of stack ranking kind of ranges would be helpful for us.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I think James typically does that. He's got a whole lexicon and Rubik's cube that we use to interpret
them. But on the -- as it relates to our outlook, we are being intentional around not applying specific
percentages around these numbers. If we wanted to fly percentages, we would just put them out there,
right? And so the language is intended to convey relative measures from slight to moderate to increasing,
without being overly specific on the percentage changes.

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Go ahead, Harris.

Harris Henry Simmons

I say especially, because we're likely to be wrong. I mean this is a -- this is an outlook. It's not a crystal

I just wanted to ask a question about the liquidity that you've got on the balance sheet. Relative to your
size, you've operated at kind of higher levels of liquidity in previous years. And if I look back to 2015,
again, on a relative basis, you were able to bring that liquidity down about 4 to 6 quarters. And given the
comments on today's conference call regarding the deposit stickiness, the opportunities for loan growth
across the franchise, I'm wondering, do you think the allocation of liquidity could occur faster this time?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, yes, so if we go back in time, you may recall, we had about round numbers in -- at the beginning
of 2015 about $8 billion of cash equivalents. And you're right, over the ensuing kind of 6-ish to 8-ish
quarters, we brought that down. And you think about the pace with which we are buying today, I mean,

we're buying -- not only are we reinvesting all that cash flow, and remember, we're -- portfolio is putting
up cash flow of about $400 million a month. We're adding $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter.

So there is a natural, I would say, limit in terms of how much positioning we want to be in any given
quarter because that quarter, that vintage of purchases is defined by the rate environment in that quarter.
And so we're trying to be measured as we were then. We're trying to be measured in the deployment of
the liquidity. Perhaps we could accelerate it a little bit. But just like we said back then, we don't want to
take a very large position in the rate environment in any given quarter, which is why we're sort of legging
into the position as opposed to putting all of our chips on rent, if you will.

Vandervliet with UBS.

Brocker Clinton Vandervliet
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

All right. This is an advantage being at the end of the call, I just -- going back to the question to before
in terms of an answer key around the descriptives. I think a number of us are kind of struggling with
specifically NII and expense guidance. And just worried -- I'm worried whether I'm a little ahead of my
skis on numbers. And I'm just looking for I guess, one on NII, just a clarification. So we should be growing
off of the 4 99 number that is ex PPP. And low -- I'm thinking low single-digit kind of expenses -- kind of
growth on that?

James R. Abbott
Senior VP and Director of Investor Relations & External Communications

Yes. Brock, this is James. What we've tried to convey in the past is like slightly increasing as kind of low
single digits and then moderately increasing is mid-single digits. We've never had to use a high -- like a
rapid growth sort of situation, at least not in a while. But so just increasing would be pretty healthy, robust
growth in net interest income, which is fundamentally driven by pretty strong securities growth, which
Paul just discussed and the improved outlook on loan growth and somewhat maybe a little bit of offset on
price on the loans as the loans -- as the front book, back book dynamic plays out. But it's -- that was a
little hard to gauge because that's a competitive environment situation. Does that help a little bit?

Brocker Clinton Vandervliet
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes, it is. It does, James. And on expenses, it's guiding off of $432 million, the adjusted total and that's
moderately increasing. So that again is...

James R. Abbott
Senior VP and Director of Investor Relations & External Communications

Correct. That pertains to kind of this recognition that there is inflationary pressures in the environment
and also the technology expenditure that Scott referenced earlier in the call.

Brocker Clinton Vandervliet
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Got it. Okay. All right. That's helpful.

Paul E. Burdiss

If I could, I would say note the color code on that Page 21. I don't think it's a stretch to say increasing is
a bigger number than moderately increasing which is a bigger number than stable or slightly increasing,
right? So that's sort of the nomenclature and the way to think about this. And therefore, you could see net
interest income is showing up clearly in the increasing count, and that is because, again, excluding PPP,
we see the opportunity to invest -- continue to grow the size of the portfolio and increasing confidence
