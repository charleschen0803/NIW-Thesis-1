WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Western Digital's Second Quarter of Fiscal
2020 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now I will turn the
call over to Mr. Peter Andrew. You may begin.

T. Peter Andrew
Vice President of Investor Relations

Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Steve Milligan, Chief Executive
Officer; Mike Cordano, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Eulau, Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements,
including product development expectations, business plans, trends and financial outlook based on
management's current assumptions and expectations, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.
We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report
on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today.
Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press
release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon. Western Digital delivered solid results in the second quarter as
revenue came in at the midpoint of the guidance range, and non-GAAP EPS was at the upper end of the
range.

Our performance reflects strong execution in our product road map, success in increasing our hard drive
gross margin and an improving flash environment. Notably, these results reinforce our prior comments
that the June quarter marked the bottom of this flash cycle.

We extended our capacity enterprise product leadership as we started sampling 18- and 16-terabyte
CMR and 20-terabyte SMR drives in December. These drives feature our energy-assisted magnetic
recording technology, providing unrivaled areal density and TCO benefits. We expect to commence
revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the March quarter and ramp shipments through the rest of
calendar 2020.

Our 14-terabyte platform is performing well, and customer interest in our air-based 10-terabyte drive is
quite high. The capacity -- the strength of our capacity enterprise product portfolio will continue to allow
us to maintain our leading market share position.

We achieved our goal of high single-digit enterprise SSD market share and secured additional NVMe
design wins, including at another major hyperscale customer, positioning us for continued revenue growth
and share gains.

We made an important announcement this afternoon of our next-generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS5,
with 112 layers of vertical storage. BiCS5 joins a full portfolio of 3D NAND technologies as our highest
density and most advanced 3D NAND today, delivering exceptional performance and reliability.

Our team executed well in the quarter, increasing our hard drive non-GAAP gross margins to
approximately 31% from 28.5% in the prior quarter. We now expect an accelerated recovery in our flash
gross margins in the first half of calendar 2020, with continued improvement through the end of the year.

I will now ask Mike to share our business highlights.

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Thank you, and good afternoon. Our December results reflect solid product execution and increase in hard
drive gross margin and an improving flash market environment.

Data Center Devices and Solutions, we executed well in delivering new products, positioning us for
continued share gains and profitable growth in calendar year 2020. In capacity enterprise drives, close
collaboration between our heads, media and mechanical design teams allowed us to simultaneously
introduce energy-assisted magnetic recording technology and a triple stage actuator and our new 16-,
18- and 20-terabyte drives. These innovations provide us with continued areal density leadership and a
greater design margin, resulting in best-in-class product quality and reliability. Our focus on introducing
the right technology at the right time while delivering the best TCO and the highest product quality to
hyperscale and OEM customers makes us their trusted partner.

In calendar year 2019, the success of our capacity enterprise product line, led by our 14-terabyte drives,
drove over a 40% year-over-year exabyte growth. We also started sampling our 18- and 16-terabyte
CMR and 20-terabyte SMR drive and plan to commence revenue shipments of the CMR drives in the
current quarter. As these drives ramp along with our 10-terabyte air-based drives, we're well positioned
for continued leadership.

In flash, we achieved our goal of high single-digit enterprise SSD market share as our NVMe-based
enterprise SSD revenue grew over 50% sequentially. Supply constraints limited our upside as demand was
better than expected. I am encouraged to see the significant investments we have made in expanding our
product portfolio over the past several years are enabling us to increase participation in higher margin,
higher growth and lower volatility parts of the flash market.

We have secured additional design wins, including another major hyperscale customer, which
demonstrates our success in broadening our product portfolio and diversifying our customer base. In
calendar year 2020, we expect to double our enterprise SSD revenue, as we move towards our goal of
20% market share.

Our competitive position within the data center is unrivaled, built on the breadth of our product portfolio,
strong customer relationships, technology leadership and superior product quality. We look forward to
another year of strong growth in the data center market.

Client Devices, strong growth in client SSD and smart video, along with growth in mobility and desktop
hard drives drove the sequential revenue growth in the December quarter. As we enter the March
quarter, flash pricing continues to improve. Furthermore, starting in the June quarter, we expect to begin
shipments into a new gaming platform. The gaming console market is expected to be a multi-exabyte
opportunity this calendar year.

Within Client Solutions, strong holiday demand for both our flash and hard drive solutions enabled revenue
to grow on a sequential basis. At CES 2020, we demonstrated a range of innovative products, including
the world's highest capacity, pocket-size portable SSD and the world's first USB 3.2 SSD exclusively for
gaming.

This afternoon, we announced our fifth generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS5. Utilizing a wide range
of new technology and manufacturing innovation, BiCS5 has significantly increased accelerated density
horizontally across the wafer. These lateral scaling advancements in combination with 112 layers of
vertical memory capability enables BiCS5 to offer up to 40% more bits of storage capacity per wafer
compared to Western Digital's 96-layer BiCS4 technology. We have commenced shipping initial consumer
products built on BiCS5, with mass production expected to begin later this calendar year.

We believe inventory in the flash supply chain has returned to normal levels. And with strong demand for
our products, we are experiencing pockets of tightness. These dynamics combined with continued product
execution in both flash and hard drives position us well for continued profitable growth.

I will now turn the call over to Bob for details on our financial performance.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $4.2 billion, up 5%
sequentially and flat from a year ago. Please recall that the September quarter was a 14-week quarter.

By end markets, Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue of $1.5 billion was down 3% sequentially and
up nearly 40% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, growth in enterprise SSD was offset by a decline in
capacity enterprise drives and the impact of our exit from the storage system business.

Client Devices revenue of $1.8 million was up 11% on a sequential basis and decreased nearly 20% year-
over-year. As Mike noted earlier, the sequential growth was driven by client SSD, smart video, mobility and
desktop HDD. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to pricing in flash, our decision to limit our
participation in mobility and a decreased TAM for notebook and desktop hard drives.

Client Solutions revenue was $948 million, up 6% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Sequential growth
was driven by strength in hard drives.

By product category, flash revenue was $1.8 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 15% year-over-year.
Flash ASPs were down 8% sequentially, primarily related to our increased participation in mobility. Bit
shipments were up 24% sequentially.

Hard drive revenue was $2.4 billion, roughly flat sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. Average price
per hard drive was flat sequentially at $81 and exabyte shipments were down 1% sequentially.

As we move on to costs and expenses. Please note, all of my comments will be related to non-GAAP
results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the December quarter was up 1.1 percentage point
sequentially to 25.9%. Our flash gross margin was 19.5%, up slightly from last quarter as a better
pricing environment was offset by our increased participation in mobile. The hard drive gross margin grew
more than expected to almost 31% from 28.5% the prior quarter. This improvement was due to the full
realization of the cost benefits of the KL closure and a stable pricing environment as overall ASP per drive
sequentially flat at $81.

Operating expenses were $765 million. Operating expenses with normal incentive compensation expense
would have been closer to $720 million. Operating cash flow for December quarter was $257 million and
free cash flow was $377 million.

Capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to
flash ventures on our cash flow statement, were an inflow of $120 million. As previously noted, we are
benefiting from the timing of the funds going back and forth between us and the joint venture.

For the full fiscal year, we expect cash capital expenditures to be close to 0. Gross capital expenditures,
which includes our portion of joint venture leasing and self-operating funding, is expected to be between
$2 billion and $2.5 billion.

In an effort to provide greater transparency and clarity into our capital expenditures, we've added a few
new slides to our earnings presentation available on our Investor Relations website.

In the December quarter, we distributed $149 million in dividends to our shareholders. We reduced
debt by $388 million, which included an optional $325 million debt pay down. From a capital allocation
perspective, our first priority is to reinvest in the business to maximize long-term shareholder value. After
that, paying our dividend and reducing our debt are the next priorities.

At the end of the quarter, we had $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our $2.25 billion revolver
remained unused, and our gross debt outstanding was just under $10 billion.

Total inventory dollars were down $165 million on a sequential basis, as both hard drive and flash
inventory decreased.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Moving on our non-GAAP guidance for the third fiscal quarter is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the
range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. We expect gross margin to be approximately 28.5% to 29.5%. Please
note that this range includes approximately $70 million in costs associated with the K1 fab.

Operating expenses are expected to be between $740 million and $760 million. The midpoint of the
guidance range assumes a return to normal variable compensation expense and selective new R&D
investments.

We expect interest and other expense of $80 million to $85 million, and we expect the tax rate to be
around -- to be between 25% and 27%. As a result of this detailed guidance, we expect earnings per
share between $0.85 and $1.05, assuming approximately 305 million in fully diluted shares.
With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator, we'll now take
our first question.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And congrats on the strong guidance. When you speak of an accelerated recovery here in flash gross
margins, can you lay out the key drivers of that through 2020? And how you're thinking about the velocity
of that recovery? And any thoughts on where you might exit the calendar year?

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes, Wamsi, this is Steve. I'll take that question. So there's really a couple of different things that I would
say are going on in terms of the flash market. One, the first thing is, as we indicated in our prepared
remarks, we believe that inventory levels in -- from an industry perspective, to the best of our estimation,
have returned in the balance or, call it, normal levels. So that's one thing that's occurred.

The other thing is, obviously, we have been working very hard on improving our product lineup, which is
allowing us to sell into markets that carry higher gross margin profiles as well as their stickier business,
and we believe that, that will help us over time to manage the volatility that is associated with the flash
business.

The other thing is that as part of all that is that there is an increasing awareness on behalf of our customer
base that, that inventory, supply and demand is tightening up. In other words, demand is going to exceed
supply this year. And so we're seeing customers recognizing that. Prices are improving. Right now, that
tightness is, it's kind of in pockets. It's not necessarily across the board. So we're seeing pockets of
tightness in the market. And as we move through the balance of the year, we expect that, that tightness
will increase.

And so what that means from a gross margin perspective, last quarter, we said that we thought we would
see modest improvement in our gross margins in the flash area. Now we're saying that those -- that our
margin profile will accelerate in terms of that improvement. And I would expect, as we move into the back
half of the year, we'll see an increasing -- more of that as the market tightens up even more in the back
half of calendar 2020.

What that means from a numeric perspective is, is that we would say that we have the opportunity for our
flash gross margins to get into the 35% to 40% range as we get into the back half of the calendar year.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's great, Steve. Appreciate the color. And can you maybe just -- you guys obviously
executed pretty well in the quarter on the HDD side, as you had guided to sort of how those margins step
up as well. Can you talk about the path of the HDD gross margins from here as well?

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes, I think the way to think about those is we're in a range where we're comfortable going forward. So we
will continue to operate around the range that we reported.

With the bias, with -- Wamsi, I would add to that with a bias for those margins improving over time as an
increasing amount of our hard drive volume shifts to capacity enterprise.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Understood.

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

So what we've talked about is something in the mid-30% range. We're not necessarily saying that, that
will happen in this calendar year, but that should be the bias over a period of time.

Operator

Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

First, kind of key thing on the hard disk drive business, I know you talked about it in the press release
or the slide deck a 100% plus growth year-over-year in air-line HDD capacity shipments. But given the
competitive landscape in the questions, I'm curious, what did that -- how did that perform on a sequential
basis? And how are you currently seeing the competitive environment?

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Yes. So I think in general, we maintain our leading market share position, call it, in the kind of low- to
mid-50s. We'll see where this all settles out once everybody reports. We expect that to continue right
through the first half of this calendar year. And then in the back half, we obviously think we have some
opportunity to continue to grow slightly. So from a product positioning standpoint, we feel very good about
not only our 14, which continues to be the highest volume shipper, but the expected ramp of our 16, 18
and 20, which will occur throughout the year. And as we noted in the prepared remarks, we will begin
initial revenue shipments in the current quarter.

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then on the gross margin, on the flash side, mix can be a meaningful driver to gross margin,
but I'm curious is, as you continue to execute on BiCS -- I guess, the BiCS4, and now we start to talk
about BiCS5. Can you just update us on how we think about the cost curve relative to that mix shift
effect to kind of take you back to that, as you said, 35% to 40% gross margin? And just where are we at
currently in the mix of BiCS4 in terms of its shipped right now?

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Yes. BiCS4 is the overwhelming majority of this. We're just starting the initial BiCS5 ramp. The way to
think about, Aaron, though, is really in this kind of 15% plus or minus annualized cost takedown. And
certainly, we would expect that to continue as we move through this next product transition. Relative to
mix, I would say, both product and market segment exposure and then, of course, the broader ASP pricing
environment are going to be the drivers of the margin enhancement through the calendar year 2020.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

I've 2 follow-ups for Mike and Steve. First, on the NAND side and on the game console, rather a new game
console. And this is incremental, as I imagine, the prior generations are hard disk drive base and now
it's migrating to SSDs. And there are some figures out there. I just want to see what is your assumption

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

for the kind of a NAND supply that the new game console is going to consume, given the fact that this is
incremental? And I have a follow-up.

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Yes. I think you're right, it is all incremental. And from an industry standpoint and certainly from our
standpoint because we were not participating in the gaming market in 2019 calendar year on the hard
drive side, I don't think we want to go any farther than what we said in our prepared remarks. This is
going to be a large multi-exabyte market, and we wouldn't want to comment any more specifically.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Okay. Fair. Moving on to hard disk drive. Obviously, you're introducing a new 18-terabyte. Can you help
me understand how your cost competitive? I understand your product has a fewer number of plates. And
as we migrate from 16 to 18, how that cost competitiveness is going to be used to increase market share?

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Yes. So I think from our standpoint, we think we have a significant time to market lead on 18 and 20.
And so the flatter count to our understanding is consistent with next generation. So our benefit relative to
market share is always about bringing the right products to the market in a leading way, getting smoothly
through customer qualification and ramping quickly. We've been doing that generation over generation for
several years. We will do that again on the 18-, 16- and 20-terabyte products that we'll be ramping this
year.

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes. And we -- and Mehdi, we do have a cost advantage. And we would think that -- I mean, that's
represented in our underlying hard drive gross profit performance. And one of the things that you're
alluding to is that our capacity enterprise drive and this continues for 16-, 18- and 20-terabyte drives that
we are using aluminum media versus glass media, and that is at a lower cost.

Operator

Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.

Karl Fredrick Ackerman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

I have 2, if I may. The first question is regarding your NAND supply outlook. You were calling for 30%
growth for the industry in calendar 2020. Is most of that coming from process conversions and what's
sitting in inventory? Or is it going to be dictated by adding substantial greenfield capacity at the K1
facility? And in addition to that, your South Korean peer last night spoke about NAND demand -- industry
NAND demand growing from high 20s for 2020. How does that play in your capital planning process?

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes. Karl, one thing I want to comment is, when they were talking about high 20%, I believe that was
supply growth, not demand growth. So -- but anyway, I'll let Mike comment on the specifics.

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Yes. So all the growth, both ours and the industry, is technology transition. So our K1 expansion is all
about technology -- room for technology transition. There is no wafer capacity in our plants going in. And
that's really, I think, a consistent theme across the industry. And just to comment further on where we

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

think we talked about low 30s in terms of supply growth. Steve commented on what Samsung's comments
were. We believe demand growth will be in the 35% plus range this year.

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Hence, the shortage.

Karl Fredrick Ackerman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Very helpful. Last one, if I may. Your enterprises see market share opportunity is quite significant, and I
think, impressive. But when we think about that, how much of that is driven by a new server architecture
launch this year versus retrofitting existing servers? And I ask because a Tier 1 U.S.-based hyperscaler
just announced after the close that depreciation will be lower for them in March due to an increase in
useful life of their servers. So if I could just kind of talk about that a little bit, that would be great.

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Yes. So no, we're not dependent on any specific server transition. So what we're able to do with our
NVMe products is when both new server and existing socket design wins in the NVMe space and then, of
course, similarly, in SaaS, there'll be a series of new products announced, where we will be designed in.
So we're not dependent on any particular server transition, and it's really the power of -- and strength of
the product portfolio as well as the customers' view of us as a preferred supplier that's driving that share
growth.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.

Timothy Patrick Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just going back -- 2 for me as well. On the HDD side, can you just talk a little bit about as 16, 18 and
20 ramp through the year just for your nearline business? What do you think the gross margin in ASP
impacts will be there? And then on the NAND side, there was a earlier comment, you talked a little bit
about mix. Could you just give us a sense as to the dilution from mobile? And should we expect more or
less participation in that market as we move through calendar '20?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So -- Tim, this is Bob. So the first one on the hard drives. And we have not been giving specifics
on capacity enterprise margins, but they are better than average. And as we've said before, as our mix
trends towards more and more capacity enterprise, we do expect our hard drive gross margins can get up
into the mid-30% range. So that will be a benefit to us. And from -- on the mix question, I mean, we're
not -- also not able to get specific in terms of exactly what the numerical implication was at mobile, but
it obviously was dilutive towards this quarter. And over time, we'll always participate some in the mobile
market, but we'll continue to manage that.

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes. And as the flash supply-demand situation tightens up, we will see the mobile market become more
attractive for us from a gross margin perspective.

Operator

Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

11

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. I wonder if you could talk about the planning process behind the CapEx at the JV level on NAND
to the extent that you guys are feeling better about the business and where profitability is going? Do you
feel the need to change CapEx at the JV? And then, I guess, sort of second half of that question. You said
earlier that -- earlier in the year that you can sort of get the industry bit growth without a lot of CapEx
because you won't have the fab shutdown, you won't have the power outage. Can you just update us on
your thinking of how that impacts your supply growth for the calendar year?

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes, I'll comment overall on the CapEx in terms of the growth and that sort of thing. I mean, from an
overall philosophical perspective, I mean, we want to be adding bit supply to the market that is consistent
largely with the overall growth from a demand perspective. So we're not -- as a result of the improving
environment, we're not looking at accelerating or decelerating our plants. But over a longer period of time,
we would want to try to manage our growth from a supply perspective to growth in demand. And so that
hasn't changed.

Operator

And our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just 2 questions for me. I just want to try to clarify at least get some numbers around this or any way
to think about it. So when you look at the SSD opportunities, you're trying to double your share there
or the NVMe, the statement you guys made in the slide deck and you combined that with the gaming
platforms coming in. How much of that is adding to kind of the overall demand? You guys gave out a 35%
number. I'm just trying to understand how much of this you guys have clean visibility on, so we can get
and understand how much of that demand is gaming plus your share gains on the enterprise side?

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

So the broader sort of industry demand number we gave you is independent of our own share growth,
right? So in any one of these particular segments. So our view of 35% demand side growth on the year is
in aggregate across the industry for bits. When we talk about segment share gains in enterprise SSD and
in gaming, that's obviously product segment-related gains. So we're not going to talk specifically about
that. I think you can kind of calculate where we think we're going on the enterprise SSD side, given my
comments.

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes, and to add kind of further context to that. I mean what we're trying to do is we're trying to place
our bids in those markets that characterize, I'll call it, 1 or 2 elements. One, opportunities for us to add
more value from a product perspective, thereby driving higher gross margin. Refer to that as, let's call it,
enterprise market. And then also those areas of the market that are either stickier, less volatile, so that we
can manage the ups and downs that tend to occur in this kind of market.

Gaming, yes, it's incremental from a flash perspective, but it also tends to be stickier business, more
predictable. And so it has some of those characteristics that are attractive to us as we look to place our
bids in more attractive parts of the market as opposed to, let's call it, more transactional or price-driven
areas of the market.

Got it. Understood. And then just last one. You guys have mentioned like 40% kind of NAND gross
margins kind of the goal you guys want to get to. I'm just trying to get a better understanding for that
ramp. So is that something you guys think you can exit at in calendar year? Or is it going to take a lot
longer than that? Just looking for any sort of help but when you guys think you can get to the kind of 40%
number you've talked to in the past?

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Well, what I commented on is that given the trajectory of our business and where we see it playing on a
calendar year, we expect that our flash gross margin rate will move into the 35% to 40% range as we get
into the back half of the year. Now that's not being specific as that calendar Q3 or calendar Q4, what say
exactly how the market evolves, but we clearly continue to believe that 40% range is the right level for us.
And we believe that we'll begin to approach that in the back half of the calendar year.

Operator

Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess, first question, you talked about industry bit supply growth in the low 30s and you would be in line
with that. Can you share with us what you expect to revenue on a bit basis? And as part of your thinking
there, how are you contemplating bits for mobility versus elsewhere?

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Well, the one thing I'll say relative -- we don't comment specifically, but we would expect to have our own
inventory positions to being quite balanced state. We are entering the year, we expect to be exiting the
calendar year to the extent you want to calculate that, that will give you a feel for it.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And your thinking on the mobility side, is that something that you're thinking maybe on -- it will
stick more to enterprise and consoles, or...

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

No. We like -- yes, the mobility side is not all created equal. And part of our effort over the last several
years is getting more product diversification, as Steve talked about, some of the newer areas. But we will
continue to maintain exposure to mobility, we will just manage that exposure and make sure we're making
or we're able to make good choices as the market continues to evolve. So we see it as a long-term area of
investment. We see there's some very attractive parts within the mobile marketplace. So we'll continue to
be investing there. We'll just be able to manage our bit allocation more broadly through this calendar year
and into the future.

Christopher James Muse
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Excellent. And as my follow-up, another question on the NAND gross margins, shocking. But I'm curious
if you could, I guess, speak to the K1 charges when you think they might roll off? And how accretive that
might be? And also, given kind of the state of the industry today, are you running a 100% utilization? And
what kind of tailwind do you see there?

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Yes. So in terms of K1, I mean, we're now having real production runs, and we'll continue to have more
production as we progress through the year. The -- this last quarter, we didn't have quite as large a charge
as we thought we were going to. I think it came in around $65 million. And I think we had said on this call
last quarter to be around $75 million. In the current quarter, in the March quarter, we're expecting around
$70 million in terms of a period expense charge, and that should start to go down after this quarter. And
it's really a function of how we ramp production and our, obviously, ability to absorb those costs, but it will
start to get better, I think, from here.

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes. And one thing, just to comment on when I talked about 35% to 40% flash gross margins in the back
half of the calendar year, that is inclusive of any potential start-up costs that will still remain in the back
half of the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Munjal Shah with UBS.

Munjal Rajendra Shah
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Two questions. One, could you just update us on the CEO search? And then secondly, on HDD exabyte,
they were down 1% sequentially. But then you talk about 100% growth on an exabyte basis year-on-
year. So if you could tie those 2 as to why on a sequential basis the exabyte could be down? And related to
nearline, what's the visibility into 2020?

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll take the CEO search comment or question, and then Mike can comment on our capacity
enterprise. So regarding the search, the search process is ongoing. And one of the things that I will add
to that is the Board is very pleased with the progress that they're making to date. And so that's all the
update we have for now.

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

And relative to the capacity enterprise marketplace, our fiscal quarter 1 was a record shipment for us.
Our exabyte share was around 57%. We were operating to optimize both profit and maintain our kind
of leading share position in the space. So some of that would be a little bit of a share drop. And I talked
about that 53% to 55%, depending on where things settle out.

But as we looked into the first half of this calendar year, we see demand across the breadth of the market
remaining fairly strong, and we think we're in a good position to maintain this leading market share
position that I just talked about. So visibility is good. Obviously, different customers have different plans.
But when we aggregate it, we feel pretty comfortable with continued strength in demand through the first
half of the calendar year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.

Steven Bryant Fox
Cross Research LLC

Just a couple of quick questions from me. First of all, you mentioned that you became a supply constraint
on the NVMe, SSDs during the quarter. Can you just sort of talk about how you work that through,
and what it implies for future growth, maybe this quarter and next quarter? And then secondly, I was
wondering if you could expand on your comment about the pockets of tightness you're currently seeing.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

What exactly would you call out, I guess, beside the enterprise, but anything you can elaborate on there
and where maybe those pockets expand to in the coming quarter?

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll take the question on the NVMe supply constraint. It was not a flash supply constraint issue.
Basically, what happened is demand was better than we had expected, and it was some of the components
that we use in our NVMe SSD product. We've worked to resolve those, and it should not be an issue as we
move forward through calendar 2020.

And then the other question?

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Yes. So I think what we're seeing is, in general, demand has been very strong across client SSD,
particularly the performance categories. So in some parts of the world, there's constraints there, and
that's being showed as being reflected in the movement on pricing in a positive direction.

Operator

Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Good to see the sharp growth in the enterprise NVMe SSD platforms. Given the strong momentum on
these products and the strong cloud spending environment, do you think that you guys actually exited
the calendar year tracking at low double-digits percentage market share? Or are we still somewhat
constrained on the supply exiting the year?

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Yes. To Steve's comment, we actually saw demand in excess of our availability of the actual other
component. So how do we been able to fully realize that, frankly, we would have been in the low double
digits, some share that remedies itself as we're now inside lead time. We continue to see strong demand
for those products. And as I talked about, we expect to double revenue in that category year-over-year.

Harlan Sur
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then on the HDD side, on the outlook for capacity enterprise exabyte shipments up kind of
35% year-over-year this year, it seems a bit conservative. I mean we're hearing that it's more likely in
the mid-40% range, with 60% type year-over-year growth in the first half of this year, just given the
continued strong cloud spending trend. So wondering if you can kind of lay out your assumptions, maybe
here in the first half of the year for exabyte consumption, just given that cloud and hyperscale spending
still seems to be quite strong?

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Yes, we haven't been too specific on that. I will say -- I will give you a comment that we do see, at this
time, a bias up in demand. So I think that's reflected in your comments. So relative to a 35% or so annual
expectation, I think our current view is a bias up from there.

Congratulations on solid performance and good to see the guide really amplifying here. I'll just stick with
nearline. Steve, could you just give us a little more context about how you see the aesthetic? And then
Mike as well of the cloud cycle through the year, like, it sounds like you're saying you expect it through the
balance of calendar year '20 now to some extent. Steve and Mike, do you see it potentially continuing? Is
this a potential, I'm not asking for a guide, but the potential to continue exabyte demand going up sort
of into the back half of the year? Is this sort of one where it gets up to a peak sooner, but then maybe as
sort of an extended kind of the cycle? Any context there would be great. Appreciate it.

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Let me try to clarify a little bit. We certainly see the first half of the calendar year remaining strong. I'll
reference back to the comments I just made. On an annualized basis, we've been talking about 35%
annualized growth. We do see, on an annualized basis, a bias up from there. I wouldn't want to comment
kind of any further on the way the full year or the shape of each of the individual quarter as well.

Ananda Prosad Baruah
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that clarification.

Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities.

Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Just a follow-up on the previous question, Steve. I guess, we have had pretty strong 2 quarters from
the cloud end market here. And there is some concern that there may be a digestion period, as we head
into the first half. And I think Intel did say that they expect somewhat of a digestion period. I'm just
wondering, you tend to have pretty long visibility in -- especially on the drive side. I'm just wondering if
you're seeing any signs of slowdown out there that causes you to kind of believe that there's going to be a
dilution period?

Michael D. Cordano
President & COO

Yes. So again, all customers not created equal. There are some that are doing that. But when we
aggregate it, the demand remains quite strong through the first half of the calendar year.

Vijay Raghavan Rakesh

Just wondering, I saw your CapEx is down for fiscal '20, keeping that discipline. I was just wondering, as
you look at the rest of the ecosystem, are you seeing any aggressive CapEx? Or how do you view that?
And also on the China side with YMTC, as they continue to expand, what are your thoughts in terms of
supply coming in with increased aggressive CapEx given how NAND pricing has been trending?

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes, I'd comment in terms of overall industry to the extent that there's public information. But as
Samsung indicated and others have indicated, we're all circling at a bit supply growth rate that's kind of
in a similar neighborhood with Samsung talking about high 20% growth rate, and we're talking low or mid
-- low 30s. And so we're kind of all aggregating. And we're not seeing anybody adding capacity from a

NAND supply perspective that would concern us, certainly not on the short term because it would take up
to 18 months for that to become productive capacity and so we're not seeing anybody behave in a way
that we think that would upset the balance from a supply-demand perspective. So -- and we feel pretty
good about that.

YMTC, no real change in terms of our expectations there. We do not see them having any material impact
in terms of the market for the next several years, and we'll continue to evaluate that depending upon
their ability to ramp not only from a pure production standpoint, but from a technology perspective, but
certainly no concerns, I would say, over the next 2 to 3 years in that regard. And that's kind of within the
planning cycle that we would have visibility to.

Operator

Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

The question is, if you can look at your calendar Q1 guide being roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, which
seems to be better than seasonal, especially on the NAND side. Can you talk about your expectations
maybe by products, hard drive drives, probably solid state drives or by segment, just curious how much of
that above seasonal guide is a function of ASP improvement for NAND?

Stephen D. Milligan
CEO & Director

Yes. So let me -- I'll comment at a really high level and then Mike or Bob can add a little bit more
specifics. But I mean, if you look at -- first thing, I want to answer it in kind of a backdoor sort of way.
If you look at our gross margin improvement quarter-on-quarter, which is pretty significant in terms
of 25.9% to 28.5% to 29.5% in terms of the range, almost all of that is driven by improving flash
environment. So namely pricing, all right? And so -- and yes, there's mix improvements and that sort of
thing. And so that directly impacts revenue. So when you look at an improving pricing,environment that's
helping us to keep our revenues, let's call it, flattish on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

And then beyond that, we continue to see the overall demand environment to be solid. I mean, just kind
of solid, not great, not necessarily, but not bad. And so it's just kind of there. And that's both a flash and a
hard drive statement. And so that's allowing us to kind of work against what would be normal seasonality
drop in revenue in calendar Q1. So those are really kind of the 2 big factors.

Operator

Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.

Nehal Sushil Chokshi
Maxim Group LLC, Research Division

And great to see the accelerated NAND flash recovery in the gross margins. I did want to make sure
I understand the dynamic that is going on there. Or do you expect your own NAND flash inventory to
decline Q-over-Q for the March quarter, which I think as Micron has commented that they were expecting
their NAND flash inventory to accumulate, but for NAND flash prices to increase. So I was just wondering
if you had some color there as far as your expectations on that?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, this is Bob. I can make a couple of comments, and I don't want to start giving guidance for inventory
by quarter. But we're still not satisfied with where we are on inventory in spite of the reduction that we
saw this quarter. And our goal over the next few quarters is to get to at least 5 turns, and that's what
we're focused on internally as a company. So it won't be strictly linear getting there, but we think we can
achieve that fairly so.

J. Ho
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Maybe as a follow-up to some of the questions about your 18- and 20-gigabit drive -- terabyte drives that
have been released, can you discuss how the gross margin acceleration or the path to your target gross
margin is impacted by your ability to get those out sooner in terms of the development of those drives?
You talked about, I think last quarter, the NAND product was pulling somewhat in terms of development.
How does that help in the acceleration of the gross margin progression?

Robert K. Eulau
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, this is Bob. I guess the first thing I would say is our gross margins are already very good in terms of
capacity enterprise. And as I said earlier, as our mix tends more and more towards capacity enterprise,
that will pull up our overall hard drive mix. Our mix was not as good as prior quarters this past quarter,
but you still saw the margin improvement, you saw that ASPs stayed flat in spite of a tougher mix.
So overall, I think margins are very solid on capacity enterprise. And I think as we introduce the new
products that trend will continue.
