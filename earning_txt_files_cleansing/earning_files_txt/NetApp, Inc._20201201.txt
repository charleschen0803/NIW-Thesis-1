Presentation

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NetApp Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Conference
Call. My name is Liz, and I will be your conference call coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, Ms.
Newton.

Kris Newton
VP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations

Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is
being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.

During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial
outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the third quarter fiscal year 2021; our expectations
regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and our ability to return to growth, gain
share and scale our cloud business, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to
update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of
reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, such as the continuing impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and the capital spending environment as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market,
scale our cloud business, generate cash flow and execute our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer
to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our
most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K, including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections and our current reports on Form 8-K.

During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated.
Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website.

I'll now turn the call over to George.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. Thank you
for joining us on our Q2 FY '21 earnings call.

NetApp delivered another strong quarter with revenue, operating margins and EPS all exceeding
our guidance. I am pleased with our continued progress in an uncertain market environment. The
improvements we made to sales coverage in fiscal year '20 and our tight focus on execution against
our biggest opportunities continue to pay off. We saw strength in all geographies with larger customers
accelerating their digital transformations with NetApp. We will continue to exploit competitive transitions,
the growth of the all-flash market and the accelerating shift to cloud to expand our leadership position.

It was a busy quarter for us. We hosted an Investor Day, held our annual customer conference and
introduced significant new products and services, which further advance our Data Fabric strategy. I want
to thank the team for their focus on execution and customer success, especially in these challenging
times.

At our Investor Day, we introduced our vision for a new NetApp, a cloud-led, data-centric software
company. We are building the new NetApp on a strong foundation. We are a trusted partner to the world's
leading organizations who are undertaking digital transformations. We have unique strategic partnerships
with the leading clouds, including deeply integrated technology and go-to-market efforts. And we have a
strong business model with a proven track record of turning market transitions to our advantage.

NETAPP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 01, 2020

We laid out a plan to scale our cloud business while growing and gaining share in the storage market.
These foundational elements fuel growth in our high-margin software, cloud services and recurring
maintenance revenue streams. This, coupled with our disciplined OpEx management, balanced approach
to investing for growth and sustained capital returns, will create significant long-term shareholder value.

As you can see from our Q2 results, we are successfully executing against this plan. Cloud services ARR
grew to $216 million, an increase of 200% year-over-year. Our cloud services dollar-based net retention
rate remains very healthy at 207%. We are pleased with the mix of new cloud services customers and
growth at existing customers.

We saw continued success with our Run-to-NetApp competitive takeout program, an important component
of our strategy to gain new customers and win new workloads at existing customers. Our all-flash business
grew 15% year-over-year to an annualized run rate of $2.5 billion. We believe we gained share again in
this important market. At the end of Q2, 26% of our installed systems were all-flash, giving us opportunity
for continued growth by converting our installed base in addition to winning new customers with our
industry-leading all-flash solutions. Growth in all-flash drove momentum in software product revenue,
which increased 14% year-over-year; and recurring maintenance and cloud revenue, which increased 11%
from last year.

As I discussed last quarter, we are learning to thrive in the new normal of working remotely with each
other, our customers and our partners. We held our Insight customer conference digitally, and it was
arguably our most successful one to date. We were joined by industry luminaries from our partners and
customers, all talking about how NetApp gives the world's leading organizations the freedom to put data
to work in the applications that elevate their business and our commitment to helping customers exploit
the opportunity of digital transformation by building data fabrics. We had a record number of attendees,
including a dramatic increase in the number of prospects and first-time attendees.

While we couldn't meet face-to-face, we had thousands of customer and partner engagements. The
interest in and excitement for our Data Fabric strategy and hybrid multi-cloud solutions was unmistakable.
We bring enterprise-grade data services to the cloud and the simplicity and flexibility of the cloud to
the enterprise data center. We are helping customers manage their data far more effectively for digital
transformation and tackle the challenges of hybrid cloud. No matter where an organization is on its hybrid
cloud journey, NetApp can help it achieve its goals.

In the quarter, we announced dozens of industry-leading innovations to further help customers
digitally transform to thrive in a hybrid cloud world. Our software-driven portfolio allows companies to
redefine how they manage data, storage and infrastructure, whether in the cloud or on-premises. We
introduced serverless and storageless solutions for containers, autonomous hybrid cloud storage and data
management and elastic scale for the modern workplace. New Spot services automate cloud infrastructure
for containers through the continuous analysis of how containerized applications use compute and storage
to automatically adjust the infrastructure to the optimal blend, saving customers costs and radically
simplifying management. Cloud Manager provides a centralized console with full visibility and control
to automate management of all NetApp hybrid multi-cloud storage and data services, such as backup,
tiering and compliance. And with our Virtual Desktop Management Service, companies can rapidly deliver
comprehensive cloud-based workplace solutions with continuous optimization of resources.

We also unveiled the latest version of our flagship operating system, ONTAP 9.8. ONTAP is at the heart of
our approach to hybrid cloud. We enhanced the ONTAP data services to provide integrated caching across
the widest range of workloads and physical data locations; enable flexible, cost-effective, instantaneous
failover for business-critical applications; and support object storage with S3 protocol access. Additionally,
we introduced new end-to-end NVMe systems, SAN-optimized systems and hybrid arrays to give
customers a broad range of price and performance options.

Finally, we made updates to NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription, providing a fast, flexible path to a cloud-
enabled data center with pay-as-you-go subscriptions for a cloud-like experience on-premises. Keystone
enables our customers to consume their Data Fabric with a cloud-like experience in their data center as
a managed service in addition to the public cloud. Only NetApp is able to offer customers this flexibility.

NETAPP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 01, 2020

Together, all of these innovations better enable enterprises to accelerate their digital transformation and
adapt rapidly to unpredictable business demand.

Let me share with you a couple of digital transformation stories to illustrate how we're helping customers
put their data to work to elevate their businesses. A leading U.S. health care provider is using AI solutions
from NetApp to improve patient care and experience. Our AI control plane and Kubernetes integration
enabled us to displace Dell, and the early success of our initial deployment has resulted in expansion
to additional workloads. We are now the foundation for everything from patient check-in to AI-based
radiology and pathology.

At a dominant U.S.-based retailer, NetApp was selected to support the work of 500 data scientists
with plans to expand to 1,000. These engineers are using data to create AI-driven recommendations
to increase sales and improve customer satisfaction. NetApp supported their need to quickly increase
their online services during the pandemic as the foundation for an AI-based service, so customers could
virtually try new products.

It's clear that COVID-19 has reshaped the environment. Digital transformation is now a necessity
requiring speed and agility to respond to changing business conditions. Hybrid cloud is the de facto IT
architecture at digitally transformed enterprises for the foreseeable future. Having an integrated, flexible
data management foundation is critical to the success of digital transformation efforts. Because of this,
data is growing in scale and importance, and we believe that NetApp is a primary beneficiary of this trend.

I am confident in both our long-term opportunity and our ability to execute against it. Our unique position
in helping the world's leading organizations solve the challenge of managing their most critical data fuels
our ability to win in the market. We are committed to driving disciplined growth, extending our hybrid
cloud leadership, effectively expanding our business and ensuring that we remain well positioned for the
future. Our growing margin-rich software and recurring maintenance and cloud revenues support our
ability to deliver value for customers and shareholders.

I'll now turn it over to Mike to walk you through the results of the quarter. Mike?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be
referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, we delivered revenue,
operating margin and EPS above the high end of guidance. Importantly, solid execution across the
company yielded Q2 billings of $1.46 billion, up 10% over year. This is our second straight quarter of year-
over-year billings growth.

In Q2, net revenue of $1.42 billion increased 3% year-over-year, including 1 point of currency tailwind.
Our 2 key strategic focus areas, our industry-leading all-flash storage business and Public Cloud Services,
both outperformed our expectations in the quarter.

When combined, software revenue, recurring maintenance and cloud revenue totaled $1 billion and
increased 12% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. We ended Q2 with $3.7 billion in
deferred revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Deferred revenue is the leading indicator for future
recurring revenue growth. And as we highlighted at our recent Investor Day, all-flash systems carry higher
maintenance dollar content relative to the rest of our portfolio.

As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue of $632 million was up 15% year-over-year, positioning us
for share gains for the second consecutive quarter. Only 26% of our installed systems were all-flash at the
end of Q2, providing a very healthy runway for our flash business.

Public Cloud Services delivered an impressive $216 million in ARR, growing 200% year-over-year and 21%
sequentially, with organic ARR growth accelerating for the second straight quarter. We continue to see
strong demand from our customer cohorts with Q2 dollar-based net retention rate coming in at 207%. We
are on track to deliver on our commitment of $250 million to $300 million in cloud ARR exiting fiscal '21
and remain confident in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal '25.

NETAPP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 01, 2020

Total product revenue of $749 million decreased approximately 3% year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw
good engagement from both enterprise and public sector accounts as customers continued to embrace
digital transformation and hybrid cloud projects. Software product revenue of $417 million increased 14%
year-over-year, driven by an increase in mix of our high-end all-flash systems.

Recurring maintenance and cloud revenue of $599 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting over
42% of total net revenue.

Gross margin of 66.9% was at the high end of guidance. Product gross margin was 53%, up 160 basis
points sequentially and ahead of our expectations. The outperformance was driven by better all-flash mix.
We expect product margin to remain at this level throughout the remainder of fiscal '21.

Our recurring maintenance, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and
growing business for us with gross margin of 82.6%.

Q2 operating expenses of $657 million were in line with our expectations. Operating margin was 20.6%
and EPS was $1.05, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Cash flow from
operations was $161 million and free cash flow was $121 million, representing 9% of revenue. As a
reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow.

During the quarter, we paid out $107 million in cash dividends, representing 88% of free cash flow. As you
know, we paused our share repurchase program in the last 2 quarters because of the macro backdrop.
More recently, we have been encouraged by the stability in our business, broader macro trends and the
recent positive results of several COVID-19 vaccine trials. As a result, we plan to reinitiate our share
repurchase program during Q3, making progress towards our commitment to offset dilution from our
equity plans. We ended Q2 with $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments.

Now on to guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.34 billion and $1.49 billion, which,
at the midpoint, implies a 1% increase in revenues year-over-year and includes 1 point of currency
tailwind. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be
approximately 20% in Q3. Assumed in this guidance are operating expenses of $660 million to $670
million. The sequential increase in OpEx is being driven mainly by the annual reset in U.S. payroll taxes
and health care benefits. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. And we
expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $0.94 and $1.02 per share. Assumed in this guidance
is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million.

In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the hard work and commitment in delivering
another great quarter. We remain well positioned to take advantage of the market transitions George
highlighted and capitalize on the big opportunity ahead.

I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?

VP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.

Timothy Patrick Long
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I just wanted a little bit more color on the cloud services business. Could you just give us a little insight
into how new customers contributed to that line? And also maybe how much are we seeing that are kind
of cloud-only deployments not also carrying some enterprise business with you? And then just another
part of that, is there anything we should look to over the next few quarters for that line as far as new
products or new outlets to help accelerate that growth line even further?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

We continue to be very pleased by many dimensions of our cloud business growth. I think we've got
expansion in regions, expansion in certifications, for example, FedRAMP certification that allow us to serve
new industries, new customer segments. And of course, the breadth of cloud service offerings. With both
Microsoft and Google, we now serve a huge range of applications, everything from databases to virtualized
environments to Windows environments and so on. And so there's a very large opportunity in front of us.

In terms of our capture, we are capturing a broad range of customers, digital natives who are born in the
cloud companies that don't really have a data center because all of their IT environments run on the cloud.
We are capturing a substantial number of net new customers who have got a data center business, but not
with NetApp, with our competitors. And of course, NetApp customers who are expanding their IT footprints
as they deploy cloud-based environments with us. So we're pleased across all the dimensions of our cloud
business.

In terms of the innovation portfolio, we are innovating at cloud speed, and you'll see continued updates
from all of our teams over the next few quarters.

Operator

Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.

Roderick B. Hall
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to drill into the product revenue, particularly the software product revenue, which grew really
well in the quarter. I know, Mike, you had said in your prepared remarks that, that was driven by high-end
AFA. So I wanted to come back to comments you made, George, earlier in the quarter when we talked to
you about the competitive environment and just ask whether you think you're taking share there? What's
driving that revenue growth? I also would love it if you guys would comment on whether there's any ELAs
in that line. I just note that Dell storage revenue was down 7% here, and you guys are down less. So
curious about your thinking on share and competitive dynamics.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

Listen, if you look at the results of all of our major competitors, Pure, Dell and HP, there's no question we
have taken share. I think our product portfolio is the best in the market. In the all-flash array category,
the richness of our software capabilities, the hybrid cloud integration, all has driven advantage in the all-
flash array segment. The all-flash array mix was up in the quarter. And within the all-flash configurations,
the high-end products, which carry a substantial amount of software and maintenance, which leads to the
growth in deferred revenue as a part of our business model. So we're really pleased.

NETAPP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 01, 2020

I think with regard to our sort of outlook, we continue to be really bullish about our portfolio. As I've said,
we got the best products in the market, uniquely positioned to give customers a hybrid cloud road map,
and I feel really, really good about our position there.

With regard to ELAs, I'll have Mike comment.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Thanks, George. Rod, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So as George mentioned, as we said in our
prepared remarks, the outperformance in product revenue and product margin, it was driven by the high-
end flash system sales. And as we noted, we expect product margins to remain right around that 53% for
the rest of the year. And as we talked about on the last 2 earnings calls, we're not guiding any ELAs going
forward because they are such a small portion of our business, which is why we're not breaking those out
anymore -- any longer going forward.

Operator

Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.

Karl Fredrick Ackerman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Is there a way to think about how much of the sequential or year-over-year growth you saw in all-flash
arrays was due to the implementation of you Run-to-NetApp initiative versus upgrading your installed
base? I ask because the 15% year-over-year growth rate is significant relative to peers and the context
of your 9% CAGR you spoke about during your Analyst Day. And so I guess as we think about the
sustainability of your growth rate for all-flash arrays, have you changed the way you incentivize your sales
force for these Run-to-NetApp initiatives or for upgrading your installed base to all-flash?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I just want to begin -- thanks for the question. I want to begin by saying that the 9% CAGR we referred to
at the Investor Day was really market growth rates of all-flash arrays. We have continued to outperform
the market. And as you noted correctly, we are very confident we are taking share in the market. The
products that we offer have leadership in performance, efficiency, hybrid cloud connectivity and a scale out
architecture that our competitors cannot match.

The Run-to-NetApp campaign, which is a competitive migration program, had another very strong quarter
in Q2. And as we noted, we are focused on attacking the competitive product transitions in some of our
competitors and taking share, and we feel very, very good about the progress to date.

If you look at the installed base, we are at 26% penetration of the installed base, which means that we
still have a very large amount of room to continue to expand the flash footprint in our installed base.
So net-net, strong quarter. We feel excellent about our product portfolio. We think we can continue to
take share, as we said at the Analyst Day, and we're demonstrating that. And our competitors have real
challenges in executing their product transitions that we are taking advantage of.

Operator

Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Yes. Thanks for all the detail around all-flash arrays, but actually, I have one follow-up trying to dig in. Is
there any way you can give us, qualitatively or quantitatively, the mix of software in AFA in the October
quarter? And how does it compare on a year-over-year and a Q-over-Q basis, so we can better understand
the trends there and what enables you to gain market share?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

NETAPP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 01, 2020

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Mehdi, it's Mike. So thanks for the question. If you take a look at our non-GAAP supplemental disclosures,
you'll see that on a quarter-over-quarter basis and year-over-year, the software portion of product
revenue grew substantially. So on a year-over-year basis, it was up 14%. Commensurately, hardware
was down 18%. A lot of that was driven by the growth in all-flash. In addition, based on the booking --
on the billings number of 10% and AFA growing faster than that, you can see that the other portions of
our portfolio shrunk year-over-year. So again, that's going to put a lot more in software, and, as George
mentioned, in support as well because you also see billings growth of 10%, revenue growth of 3% and a
lot of that -- everything that doesn't go to revenue goes to the balance sheet, which is great for our future
support revenue. So hopefully, that helps in your question.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

Maybe I'll just add. With regard to the color on why are we taking share in the all-flash business, I think
there are 2 things there. One is we are more focused on executing better, as we signaled, where we have
really put emphasis on winning with the strongest parts of our portfolio against the biggest opportunities.
And the second, I think, is COVID has really accelerated in our customers their thinking about hybrid cloud
deployments, and we have clear leadership in helping our customers build hybrid cloud architectures. I
think those are the 2 elements in addition to having a really strong product portfolio that gives us the
ability to take share.

Operator

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my question is on all-flash array as well and maybe 2 parts to it. But
all-flash growth at 15% is fairly impressive. So I'd love to understand the sustainability of this double-digit
growth as we go forward. And then assuming this mix keeps shifting towards more AFA, I'm somewhat
surprised by the commentary on product gross margins will remain flat for the rest of the year because I
would imagine all-flash arrays have a better gross margin structure with the -- versus rest of the products.
So just touch on the sustainability of this growth we're seeing in all flash array. And then why aren't we
seeing a better flow-through in product gross margin given the mix is getting better?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I'll talk about the first part of your question, Amit, thank you, and then I'll give it to Mike to talk about the
product gross margin. With regard to the all-flash array business, we see, as we said at Investor Day, this
being a multiyear transition in the storage market. We see that because we are still in the early innings of
the technology curve in the all-flash array market. And we think that there are more technologies coming
online over the next 18 to 24 months that will move more and more of the disk-based market to the all-
flash market.

We don't think that all of the disk-based market moves to all-flash. But as we said, a substantial
percentage of the total storage market, meaning, let's say, 70% to 80%, will be an all-flash array
portfolio.

We are in the early stages. We think that we -- as we said, in our installed base, as an example, we are at
26% after many, many years of driving all-flash, and there's a long way to go just to upgrade our entire
installed base to all-flash.

With regard to the ability to continue to drive share gains, it's about focus, it's about innovation and it's
about meeting customer expectations. We think we're doing a good job, and we're going to continue to
keep doing that. With that, let me hand it to Mike to talk about gross margins.

NETAPP, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  DEC 01, 2020

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Thanks, George. Amit, thanks for the question. So a couple of pieces on this that I would focus on. As we
talked about earlier today in the prepared remarks, the majority of the outperformance in gross margin
came from the high end of our all-flash. That was something that we had not expected going into the
quarter. Our guidance for the rest of the year assumes that, that normalizes a little bit, still growth in
all-flash. But as you get into the high end, you get even a little bit better margins because of the higher
percentage of software. So we're forecasting that to come back and normalize a little bit, still growth in
all-flash, just not so much of the high-end mix.

Operator

Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Michael Tsvetanov
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. I just have a quick one. Last quarter, I think you disclosed $44 million
of ARR attributed to your recent acquisitions of Cloud Jumper, Spot and Talon. Could you give us an idea of
what that was this quarter?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Michael, it's Mike Berry. Yes. So we are not going to disclose the ARR from the acquisitions going forward.
I would tell you that they have continued to grow. We did disclose that the growth rate of the organic ARR
accelerated as well during the quarter. So still all good on the acquisitions. But going forward, we're not
going to break those out separately.

Ananda Prosad Baruah
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on solid execution. Yes, this one just might be for both of you guys. Could you give us a
sense of how you guys are viewing sort of spending recovery right now? Where do you think sort of the
industry is in that? And is there any way to anecdotally give us a sense of how much of the strength in
performance has been from industry recovery, sort of reopening the sales force initiatives? George, some
of what you talked about, which is just the strength of the portfolio as folks look to maybe stand up the
incremental hybrid. Just trying to get a sense of all of that and really to get a sense of how much more
there may be to go from a structural sense for you guys since you have so many initiatives going on right
now.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I think, first of all, we are in an extraordinary time, and I want to applaud our customers, our teams for
being able to continue to execute in such a difficult time. I would tell you that we have had a great first
half and that is primarily because of our focus and execution, right? I think the macro has been choppy.
I think it's not going to deteriorate further. It's stabilized. But if you look at the results of our business
against those of our competitors, there's no question we took share, and we out executed them in a
relatively tough market.

I think within the customer base, I want to highlight 3 things. First, enterprise customers are beginning
to move their businesses forward because they realize that they have to transform to meet the moment
and to thrive in the moment. And so the transformational projects, especially in the larger customers, are
moving forward. Our business mix is tilted towards that, and we are benefiting from that.

The second, I think, is that, listen, we're pleased with the vaccines and the news about the vaccines. We
think that the economy has mostly stabilized and it will go forward, it should get better from here. But
we are in a midst of a nationwide lockdown. We have lockdowns in many other parts of the world. We are
in for a tough few months here between November and January. And so we're being prudent about our
outlook for the next few months. We think we are extremely well positioned for when the market turns as
it will over time. Mike, do you want to add any comments?

Well, I was going to ask, any update on how -- the impact that sales force has been able to make so far?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

We said that we were adding capacity, about 200 heads. We had provided an update that we had met our
expectations of that hiring 1 quarter ahead of time in Q4 of fiscal year '20. Those heads are on board.
They are driving really good results. It takes about 4 quarters for a rep to be fully productive. So as we
said, this fiscal year is the payout for that investment. We're pleased with the progress, and we're going to
keep our head down and keep executing.

Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.

Matthew John Sheerin
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

In your commentary, you highlighted the Keystone as a service model. Can you provide more color on the
kind of traction you're seeing there from customers, the kind of customer mix and growth projections? And
given that most of your competitors are offering similar as a service programs, how is the NetApp program
differentiated?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I think, first of all, thanks for the question. Keystone is an element of how we offer customers the ability
to have an outcome as a service. There are financing vehicles that we and other people offer, which are
really procurement vehicles. We've always had them. They are a part of our selling motion. And you know
what, I think they are going to continue to be a part of our selling motion go forward.

With regard to what we do with Keystone is offer it to customers who don't want to deploy and manage
infrastructure, but just want to have an outcome as a service. We have many ways to fulfill that type of
demand from customers. Clearly, our cloud solutions are the first and most effective way to meet those
expectations because you can instantly spin up environments and instantly spin them down. And you've
got them deployed on all of the world's leading public clouds with the best operating system in the world.

The second is Keystone services from NetApp and similarly Keystone-like services from our wide range
of service provider and managed service partners. So we have a good number of ways to meet that
customer demand. I'm excited at the pipeline of Keystone and the wins we're having. They are enterprise
customers. A lot of them are competitive footprints, takeouts, and they are net new environments. So

Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.

George Michael Iwanyc
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

George, following up on your comments regarding the current environment. Can you maybe give us a
sense for the puts and takes of if there is a continued surge maybe here in the U.S. and then globally,
what you've learned over the last quarter from a COVID perspective?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I think we do believe that the next few months, as I said earlier, are going to be a challenging set of
months, right? I think you see that in the news every day. And what we are seeing is that companies
have begun to move towards the new normal, right? They've optimized their operating model to deal with
a hybrid or a remote working model. They realize that they have to get moving on projects that were
historically stalled and so on. So we do think that they are better equipped to deal with the surge, if there
is one. The human challenge and the cost of doing so is high, right? And so we're being appropriately
careful in our outlook for the next few months. We think that, as we said, for the most part, I think we see
every sign that things have stabilized. They're not back to the new normal. There'll be improvements over
time to get there. But I think sort of the further downward trajectory, mostly stabilized.

Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.

Steven Bryant Fox
Fox Advisors LLC

George, just one more on the market share gains. You highlighted how all-flash arrays was sort of a
stimulus for not just the upside in the quarter, but also driving more software sales. Can you just sort of
talk about why you saw sort of the higher-end revenues and how much you're able to sort of shape that
going forward as opposed to just benefiting from certain workloads?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I think, first of all, all-flash arrays have a higher mix of software. The software in the all-flash array is
what makes it so much more efficient in terms of workload consolidation, infrastructure management,
automation and so on. And our all-flash arrays certainly carry a very rich software portfolio. With regard to
the mix, it really depends on the customer type and the customer use case. If there are big consolidation
environments, they generally tend to have a larger system so that they can deploy fewer systems to
consolidate more environments. If it is more of a project-based mix, they typically have a more mid-range
type of model that they deploy. So it's really dependent on customers.

I think we feel very good about our competitive position across all the elements, midrange, high and entry.
And we're going to stay focused on selling the right solution to customers. I would also say what's unique
about NetApp is we also have a really good hybrid flash portfolio that allows us to sell the right product for
the right use case in customers.

Looks like you guys had a good quarter in U.S. public. Wondering if you could talk a little bit more about
what drove that strength? And how sustainable you think tailwinds are in that segment going forward?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I want to thank our U.S. Public Sector team and our Public Sector leader. We -- it was good execution
in the public sector business. As we have said on prior calls, we have continued to broaden the range of
our public sector business, both to be more involved in program-type spending that is distributed over
the course of a year rather than at the typical public sector year-end in the federal agencies as well as
to grow our state, local and higher education business, which for us is a smaller percentage of our total
business than a typical company our size. And I think we've done well across all those dimensions. We've
had some really good wins in slides. We have a broad book of business in the public sector, and I feel
good about where we are. We have a new administration coming in. We'll have to wait to see what the
administration's priorities are, but I'm confident that our team will adjust and adapt appropriately. And so
we'll take it a good quarter at a time, and we're pleased with the progress.

Louis Rocco Miscioscia
Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division

On a similar note, it looks like Europe was seasonally strong, maybe even a little bit stronger than U.S.
commercial. So just any reason why in comparison to last year? I know seasonality is changing a lot these
days. From comparison to last year, U.S. commercial was a little bit stronger, but you had a strong Europe
this year.

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

If you just look at the first half of this year, the U.S. business has done really well. I'm pleased with
the progress. I think when I look at puts and takes between Q1 and Q2, deals move around between
the quarters. So I wouldn't draw any unusual conclusion. I feel like we did see a much stronger book
of business in Q2 across all the geographies. So I feel really good. As we talked about in my prepared
remarks, the breadth of the business is encouraging, and we're going to continue to stay focused and
execute.

James Dickey Suva
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

George, congratulations to you and your team. If my memory is correct, I think your sales force was
all in place about a quarter ahead of time, which means by now, they're kind of fully on boarded, got
their health care benefits, done shadowing and are out there. And if so, it seems like the second half of
your fiscal year should even be stronger than this first half, plus we're kind of getting hopefully through
coronavirus with some vaccines and other countries opening up. Is that a logical way to think of things
that the second half of this year could even be stronger? Or are there some things that kind of -- we
should kind of pause or be aware of? It just seems like everything is really striking in sync and quite well
at NetApp. I just don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but it seems like second half should even be
stronger than first half.

Jim, thank you for your question and for the comments. Listen, you're correct about the sales force hiring
having been completed a quarter ahead of time in Q4 of fiscal year '20. And as we said, we are enabling
them, and it takes about 4 quarters to get a rep fully up to speed. We had a great first half. We delivered
on our key strategic initiatives. We're growing all-flash revenue, taking share, continue to scale our cloud
franchise. As I've said before, we love our market position. We have competitive transitions. The pipeline
is healthy. The cloud platform is clearly expanding with the big hyperscalers. And as I said, we see the
macro stabilizing. The vaccine trials should give us all incremental confidence.

We're trying to balance the sobering reality of what the next few months looks like, right, for businesses,
for families, the lockdowns, not only in the U.S., but in many, many parts of the world. And so we're trying
to balance the reality with the fact that our customer engagement, even in Q3 and compared with them,
continue to be very constructive. So what we're trying to do is take a prudent view of what the near term
looks like given the uncertainty, but we feel very, very good about our position here today.

Mike, do you want to add anything?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

So I'll just add a couple of things. Jim, thanks for the question. As George talked about, we do feel good
about the business. That is one of the reasons why we are reinstituting our share buyback, as we look
forward. We do expect it's still going to be a couple of months of difficult times, unfortunately, for all of
us. The other thing to keep in mind, too, and some of the great questions earlier is, when we give revenue
guidance, keep in mind, as well, Jim, that based on the changing mix of the business that we do expect
billings growth to continue to be ahead of revenue growth as we do more AFA and cloud. So also just as
you look at the second half, keep that in mind as well, please.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Congrats on a great quarter, guys. George and Mike, I think you guys are seeing nice progress on the
cloud data services business. It's accelerating. I think you're probably tracking towards the high end of
your fiscal year '21 guidance. You talked about some of the factors. But I guess, can you give us some
update what are you -- the white listing that it's -- that was, call it, a hindrance and the Azure File is
still in place. And maybe can you give us some color on what percentage of the net new NetApp CDS
customers have an existing on-prem environment versus what percent of those are born in the cloud?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

With regard to the progress of the cloud data services business, we feel really good. I think the last couple
of quarters have really demonstrated the progress in our business, both in our organic business, which
continues to accelerate; and the inorganic portfolio, especially Spot. We have a strong value proposition
for customers, helping them optimize both compute and storage in the cloud for both traditional workloads
as well as cloud-native workloads, containerized workloads, serverless computing and so on. So really
good, broad position in the market. With regard to our business mix, as I said, we are getting a broad
range of customers, both cloud-native customers who are born in the cloud companies as well as
enterprises that did not buy from NetApp that have data center footprints with our competitors. I think all
of these are vehicles for us to go displace over time or expand our share of wallet at customers over time.

Mike, do you want to add any comments?

George Kurian

Maybe I can just hit on your comment about white listing. Listen, white listing is a capability that's put
in place. It requires customers to essentially register before they deploy a workload on our service. And
given the kinds of workloads that we deploy on the public cloud platforms, high-performance computing,
mission-critical, run the business workloads like SAP and mission-critical database environments like
Oracle Rack, we are going to continue to monitor -- we're making progress towards the removal of white
listing. But we're going to keep it in place for as long as we need to make sure that our customers have
less flawless customer experience.

Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street.

Eric Martinuzzi
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to better understand the sequential revenue in the hardware maintenance and pro services.
So historically, I would expect that to kind of inch up Q1 to Q2. And I know it's composed of about 80%
hardware maintenance and about 20% pro services. What can you tell me about that Q1 to Q2 and then
your expectation for Q3?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. Eric, it's Mike. Keep in mind that Q1 had the extra week in it. So when you look quarter-on-quarter,
that was about $40 million of incremental revenue that we recorded simply because of the extra week
coming off the balance sheet. It was about half and half between software and hardware, pretty close. So
you need to, when you look quarter-on-quarter, back out that increase or that amount in Q1. When you do
that, you actually see a nice growth still sequentially in hardware maintenance.

Eric Martinuzzi
Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And the expectation for Q3, that continues?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

As long as -- that depends entirely on the conversation we just had earlier, Eric, in terms of the mix.
If the mix holds consistent with what we saw in Q2, then there would be really no reason to believe it
would be different. Keep in mind, too, that $3.7 billion of deferred revenue, like most software technology
companies, 80% to 90% of our maintenance revenue comes off their balance sheet. So you don't get a lot
of impact in the quarter outside of FX.

This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. A number of conversations we've had suggested that Dell's mid-
range power store refresh has fallen somewhat short of market's expectations. Is this consistent with what
you've observed? And is this a significant piece of the share shift that's contributing to NetApp's results?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

I think a couple of things there. First of all, we continue to believe that the mid-range modular
architecture, like NetApp has, is the sweet spot in price/performance across the entire landscape. There

are customers that will buy a high-end architecture like a PowerMax or our high-end systems, but the vast
majority of the customer workloads are going to transition to a mid-range clustered system. And I think as
not only we have observed, but many of our competitors have also observed, the mid range from Dell has
not met expectations. It is an incomplete product. It is hard to build a new mid-range system. And so it's
going to be some time before they can mature that and make that a real system. And you bet, we intend
to take share from them during that transition. We have seen the execution and the impact of that in our
Run-to-NetApp campaign, and we're going to pour it on.

Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital.

Nehal Sushil Chokshi
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Good quarter, by the way. I wanted to follow on a question here before that you answered to George,
where you talked about confidence that shift to all-flash array was going to continue due to flash
innovations coming down in the next 18 to 24 months. Could you detail what are those flash innovations?
And then another question real quickly is that what are the pieces of add-on software that tends to attach
more to all-flash array than hybrid arrays?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

With regard to the innovations in the all-flash array market, there are more cost-effective technologies
coming in the all-flash array segment, right, like quad level cell technology that continues to erode
the value proposition of performance drives, 10K drives. That transition is underway. We think there
will be more and more of that market that will transition to all-flash arrays. The second is with regard
to the software contribution, what we do with software in the all-flash arrays is to make them much
more efficient in terms of data reduction, data compression and so on. And the second is to allow them
to protect their data in more and more ways, given that you have a ton of data sitting on an all-flash
system. So the economics of all-flash are benefited by using software-based data management. And
those configurations, as a result, have a higher percentage of their value in software than in a disk-based
system.

Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.

Shannon Siemsen Cross
Cross Research LLC

Just a question on component costs, I'm curious as what you're seeing. HPE, and it's not necessarily an
exact overlap, obviously, but mentioned that some of their backlog was filled with higher-cost components
as they're seeing some price increases. Is that something you're looking at? And how do you feel about
the opportunity to pass-through some of the component cost increases that we're expecting as you go into
2021 and beyond?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Shannon, it's Mike. So what we saw in Q2 is we did see higher component costs, specifically related to
SSDs. We do expect in the second half of our fiscal year to see some of that pricing pressure ease. So
we do expect some lower pricing, and we do expect that likely will continue into '22. Now a lot of that
depends on the economy. As you know, a lot of SSDs are also consumed by some consumer products,
mobile phones. We're seeing a lot of that demand drop as we go into the second half of our fiscal year.
We expect that to go into '22. We'll see how the economy rebounds, though. But overall, we do expect
component costs to be a little bit of a help in the second half and then hopefully going into '22. But we'll
have to see how the supply and demand comes out, especially on SSDs.

Kathryn Lynn Huberty
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. George, you gave a few examples of customer adoption of AI use cases. Do you
have a sense for what percent of new orders or new deals tie to AI workloads? And is this a driver of the
strength in high-end all-flash array demand in the quarter?

George Kurian
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Katy. We saw -- we are focused in our game plan on AI in solutions that are tied to specific
industries. I think in health care, we are seeing a good adoption of AI where the stretched employees,
whether they are radiologists or whether they are patient administration personnel, are being helped by
AI techniques. And we also are focused in manufacturing and in select parts of financial services on the
use of AI. So we're seeing good returns from that. I think with regard to why we are succeeding with AI
techniques and AI solutions is because video and audio analysis, image analysis, for example, is now a
mature and effective AI technique. And image and video and audio files, they sit on NetApp file storage.
And so we're an excellent platform for AI for them.

Paul Chung
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So just a quick one on free cash flow. So are we going to see large harvesting of working cap as we
typically see in the second half of the fiscal year? I did notice less investments in working cap in the first
half relative to kind of past year. So maybe not as large of a kind of seasonal swing in the second half?
Just your thoughts there.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Paul, it's Mike. Thanks for the cash flow question. Always fun to get those. So great question. So keep
in mind, last year, 2 big movers on cash flow to note that -- and you saw it in the numbers in Q2 of last
year that the tax payments were pulled forward really into Q2. We paid about $100 million more in taxes
last year in Q2 than this year. I note that because we will still pay those. They'll just fall into the second
half. The other part is as it relates to working capital, as you saw in the cash flow statement, we did do
better in Q2 in collections. You saw that in the cash generated by deferred revenue and ARR. So as long as
billings continue at the level that we're at, I would expect to see that in the second half as well. But as you
think about second half, please keep in mind those tax payments, that will be the biggest swing factor on
working capital.

CEO, President & Director

We are actually saying that -- QLC, first of all, is not in the market yet. It will be over time, right? I think
that what we are saying is QLC makes the advantage of an all-flash array relative to a 10K performance
drive even better. So today, there are customers buying all-flash arrays when they are roughly 3x the
cost of a hard drive. With QLC, that number gets a lot closer to 1.5 to 2x. And so the advantage will be
even more material. I think we got to compete to win share in the all-flash array transition that, that
drives, right? Plain and simple. I don't think that it's going to not require us to execute. We think that
more workloads will come on to all-flash. And to the extent that we execute in their all-flash transition, it
gives us a chance to pick up share.

Kris Newton

All right. Well, thanks, Wamsi. I'll now pass it back to George for final comments.
