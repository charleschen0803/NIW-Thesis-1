All right
Thank you, Andrew
Good morning, and welcome to ITW's first quarter 2017 conference call
I am Michael Larsen, ITW's Senior Vice President and CFO
Joining me this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi
During today's call, we will discuss our first quarter financial results and update you on our 2017 earnings forecast
Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecasts for the second quarter and full year 2017 as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide
We refer you to the company's 2016 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations
Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures
And while we use very few non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott
Starting with slide 3, GAAP EPS increased 19% to $1.54, 21% excluding the effects of currency translation
As Scott noted a minute ago, organic growth was 3.5% in the quarter
Total revenue was $3.5 billion, an increase of 6%
Six of our seven segments had positive organic growth and Welding improved to flat
Organic growth was positive in all major geographies, with North America up 1.4% and International up 6.4%, driven primarily by Europe, which was up 6% and China, which was up 19%
We increased operating margin 120 basis points over last year, which was driven by continued progress on our enterprise strategy initiatives and volume leverage
Enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of margin expansion
The 2016 acquisition of EF&C diluted margin by 50 basis points
So on an apples-to-apples basis, operating margin improved 170 basis points
Six of seven segments increased operating margin
And excluding the EF&C margin impact and Auto OEM, all segments improved
Operating income grew 12% to $809 million, the highest quarterly total in the company's 105-year history
Our effective tax rate was 28.3% in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations as we adopted new FASB guidance for stock-based compensation effective January 1. The new guidance requires that the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense rather than equity
Free cash flow of $399 million was 74% of net income, which is in line with typical seasonality
That said, in Q1, free cash flow was impacted by the timing of some tax and pension items
Adjusted for these items, free cash flow conversion would have been even better at 91%
On slide 4, you can see that we achieved an all-time record for operating margin in the quarter
This was largely driven by the continued strong execution on our enterprise initiatives and volume leverage
Enterprise initiatives contributed 100 basis points of structural margin improvement and volume leverage contributed 80 basis points
As expected, price/cost was slightly unfavorable in Q1 due primarily to higher steel prices
At current raw material costs and with our 2017 price adjustments, we expect that price/cost for the full year will be positive in dollar terms and slightly unfavorable 10 to 30 basis points to margin percentage
As we've discussed before, we don't expect that price/cost will have a material impact on our results in 2017. Turning to slide 5, on the left side of the page, overall organic growth in Q1 improved 1.5 percentage points versus Q4 due to meaningful improvement in end market conditions in our Welding and Test & Measurement and Electronics segments, continued strong and above plan organic growth from our Auto OEM segment, and continued progress on our pivot to growth efforts across all seven of our segments
I'll now discuss the segment results in a little more detail, starting with Automotive OEM, which delivered another strong quarter with above plan organic revenue growth of 9%, 300 basis points above global car builds
In North America, 4% organic growth exceeded auto builds of 3% overall and 1% for the Detroit 3 where we have relatively higher content
Outside North America, growth continued to be very strong, with Europe up 12% or 600 basis points above market
China was up 29%, significantly above market as we continue to increase our content per vehicle, particularly with domestic OEMs. Despite the strong performance in Q1 and a positive outlook for Q2 for our Auto OEM business, IHS is still forecasting a decline in domestic auto builds in the second half
Our full year guidance incorporates the IHS forecast as it currently stands, which results in full-year organic growth for our Auto OEM business of approximately 3%
Turning to slide 6. Food Equipment was up 2% organically
North America was up 1%, with stable demand for equipment up 2%
Internationally, both equipment and service were up 3%
Operating margin improved 60 basis points to 25.1%
We had a strong quarter in Test & Measurement and Electronics, both businesses grew organic revenue by 6%, with strong demand in semiconductor-related end markets
In Test & Measurement's Instron business, where demand is tied more closely to business investment, organic growth was up 5%, which is certainly an encouraging sign
Operating margin improved 450 basis points to 20%
The 20% includes 350 basis points of the non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets
Turning to slide 7, Welding organic growth was flat in Q1, which is a significant improvement versus down 8% in Q4. Excluding normal seasonality, demand improved 3% sequentially from Q4 to Q1. Year-over-year, equipment was up 1% and consumables were down 1%
By geography, North America, which is approximately 80% of our business, was up 2%, driven by our commercial equipment business
Our commercial equipment business, which sells through distribution to construction, light fabrication, and farm and ranch customers, was up 4% year-on-year in Q1. Our industrial equipment business, which sells primarily to manufacturing, including automotive and heavy equipment, was down 1% in the quarter
Operating margin performance was the highest in the company at 27.7%
Polymers & Fluids delivered another solid quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 2%
Bulk (09:51) Fluids, which primarily sells highly engineered lubricants and cleaners into industrial and commercial end markets and automotive aftermarket, grew 2%
Polymers, which primarily sells adhesives and sealants for industrial MRO and other OEM applications, was essentially flat
Operating margin was 20.6%, which includes 420 basis points of non-cash expense associated with amortizing acquisition-related intangible assets
On slide 8, Construction Products was up 3% organically, despite a challenging comparison
Demand in North America was solid with organic growth down 2% compared to up 11% in Q1 last year
Commercial was down 1% and residential was down 2%
And as we've discussed before, the quarterly revenue numbers here can be a little lumpy
International growth was strong, with Europe up 8% and Asia Pacific up 5%
Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 22.5%
Finally, in Specialty Products, organic revenue was up 1%, with strong organic growth of 8% in our consumer packaging businesses
Operating margin was 26.9%, an increase of 80 basis points
Turning to slide 9 and our updated guidance for 2017. As a result of our strong Q1 results and assumptions for the balance of the year, we're raising our full year earnings guidance by $0.20 to a new EPS range of $6.20 to $6.40. The $0.20 raise is essentially $0.10 from the first quarter beat, plus $0.06 from higher organic growth, and $0.04 from a slightly lower tax rate of 29%
At current levels of demand, we now expect higher organic growth of 2% to 4%, which, as mentioned previously, includes the IHS forecast for North American Automotive business in the second half of the year
For the full year, we continue expect that operating margin will exceed 23.5%, with 100 basis points of structural margin improvement from our enterprise initiatives
Finally, for the second quarter, our EPS guidance is $1.55 to $1.65 with organic growth of 2% to 4%
With that, we'll now open the call to your questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Good morning
So Andrew, incremental margins, as you pointed out of â€“ if you look straight off the P&L, we're 44%, certainly, really solid performance
If you add back the impact of EF&C, we are in the 77% range for incrementals
We talked about this on the call last time that, in the short term, we could see incremental margins above our long-term average of 30% to 35% until investments in overhead and other areas catch up to support the growth
Our view, long term, is we would still expect to be in that 30% to 35% range for incremental margins, but certainly well above that here in the near term
No, we're always investing and the levels we're investing at now are similar to what we have been doing in prior years
I think, (18:42) Scott, nothing's really changed in terms of how we look at capital allocation
You're right that we're fortunate that we have a strong balance sheet and we generate free cash flow well above net income on an annual basis
In terms of the buybacks specifically, we have planned for $1 billion of buybacks in 2017 starting with $250 million
In the first quarter we have done that and certainly we're on track to execute on that program
To the extent that there is surplus capital, we'll address that as we go through the quarter and we'll update you on the earnings calls if that number can go higher from here
But certainly, we're off to a good start on free cash flow
I'd say on the M&A environment, we've talked about this on prior calls, our views haven't really changed
And just because we're sitting on more cash, doesn't mean that we will not be disciplined in terms of how we look at M&A
Good morning
So those price increases, Joe, have largely been done already
So that's based on what's been implemented year-to-date
So there's really nothing major outstanding from a price standpoint
Yes, we're seeing positive price increases in all of our segments
Yeah, that's 3% in our business, Joe
Thank you
I think it's primarily, Nigel, the comp to last year, we had a really strong Q2 last year and that's really the main driver here
Yeah, I think that's a reasonable assumption
I think the plus 9% organic in Q1, we may not get all the way there in Q2. But certainly, we feel good about the second quarter
When we look at the full year in Test & Measurement, we're looking at growth in the low single-digit range
So part of what you see in Q1 is also a fairly easy comparison on a year-over-year basis
So certainly encouraging what we've seen
I'd point to Instron and the businesses tied to business investment as really the more meaningful data point here in Q1. Semiconductor as you know, is really hard to forecast, but we feel good about where we are right now
Through Q2, yes, on the semi-con side
No, we have not
Ann, so how I would maybe put this in context, our sales in France represent about 5% of our overall sales
And we were actually up 3% in the first quarter, really driven by Construction and Automotive primarily
And so I think it's a little too early to tell whether anything has changed at this point
We still feel good about the outlook for Europe
No, we didn't see anything like that
I think the only thing I'd point to is on the price/cost side, we are a little cautious given what we saw in Q1, and so that's why we didn't take the margin guidance up
Actually, if you look at our Q1 EPS and you add the midpoint of our guidance for Q2, we're exactly at 50% of the year from a full year EPS standpoint
So that's â€“ historically, that's what we've been doing for a long time
So it's pretty even
I can share that the (40:17) monthly, the cadence, this was a pretty typical quarter
There was really nothing unusual there
Construction Europe, we certainly benefited from some end market lift, being up 8% in Europe
I think there's still some work to do, as you know, from a simplification standpoint
But overall, encouraged by the progress in our Construction business in Europe
Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC And sorry, any commentary on April, if that's falling in line with seasonal trend or
We're right on track with the guidance we're giving you today
Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
Yeah, I think what I would say is we expect overall, globally, to outgrow the market 200 to 400 basis points, consistent with what we have said in the past
Exactly how that plays out in the back half, we'll have to see
Clearly, in Europe, we're running above that rate; and China, significantly above that average penetration rate
And then we're a little bit lower in North America, because of the starting point
Our content per vehicle in North America is still significantly above where we are outside the U.S
That is correct
Well, thank you very much for joining us today, and have a great day
