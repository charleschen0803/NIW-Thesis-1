Presentation

Operator

My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference facilitator this afternoon. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Fortive Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Griffin Whitney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr.
Whitney, you may begin your conference.

Griffin Whitney
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. With us today are
Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer.

We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by SEC Regulation
G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website,
www.fortive.com, under the heading Financial Information.

We completed the divestiture of the automation and specialty business on October 1, 2018, and
accordingly, have included the results of the A&S business as discontinued operations for historical
periods. The results presented on this call are based on continuing operations.

During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-
year performance. All references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-
over-year on a continuing operations basis.

During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities
laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may
occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today.
Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-
looking statements is available in our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2019, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. These forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update
any forward-looking statements.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share
of $0.68 for the second quarter of 2020 as we delivered better-than-forecasted revenue performance
despite the difficult conditions created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It was a quarter that clearly
reflected the power of the Fortive Business System as we executed our playbook on expense savings and
working capital management, enabling us to achieve decremental margins of 33% and generate very
strong free cash flow.

Throughout the quarter, we continue to operate all of our essential production facilities around the world
and proactively manage our supply chains while adopting comprehensive new protocols to protect the
health and safety of our employees. With a focus on maintaining continuity despite the shift to a virtual
operating environment, the Fortive team leveraged new virtual sales and marketing tools to continue
to engage with customers. We also adjusted product development processes in order to continue to

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

meet project time lines while continuing to invest across the portfolio to emerge from this period with an
enhanced competitive position.

When we looked ahead on our Q1 earnings call in April, we faced a highly uncertain operating environment
due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Q2 performance demonstrated the resilience
we built into the portfolio over the past 4 years, with an increased share of recurring revenue from our
expanding set of subscription-based software solutions, services and consumables offerings. Recurring
revenue accounted for more than 35% of total revenue in Q2, a new high for Fortive. Importantly,
this resilience came through despite the fact that a key source of our recurring revenue, Advanced
Sterilizations Products, experienced a decline in the elective surgical procedures as health care systems
around the world weathered the early months of the pandemic.

With respect to Vontier, we made additional progress in Q2 preparing for its separation from Fortive as
we continue to evaluate our options for structuring the separation either via spin or split. The Fortive and
Vontier teams remain in a position to move forward and effect the separation as soon as market conditions
permit. Mark Morelli and Dave Naemura continue to guide the Vontier businesses through the challenging
macro conditions while also leading the build-out of Vontier's organizational capacity as the team prepares
for its future as an independent public company.

We issued our most recent corporate social responsibility report at the end of Q2, highlighting the
important progress we have made across our portfolio over the past year. Our CSR framework organizes
our priorities into 7 strategic pillars, which capture the full breadth of our initiatives around corporate
social responsibility. Consistent with our belief in the strength that comes from building diverse teams, we
have always aimed to cultivate an inclusive environment at Fortive. Over the past few months, we have
acted on these values to help our teams advance an internal dialogue about addressing critical broader
themes of social justice. As we look to continue living our values and fulfilling our commitment to our
employees and our communities, the Fortive and Vontier teams will remain strongly committed to increase
diversity, equality and inclusion as a key tenet of our culture and our corporate social responsibility efforts.

With that, let's turn to the details of the quarter. Adjusted net earnings were $241.9 million, down 25%
from the prior year. And adjusted net -- adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.68. Total sales
declined 15.7% to $1.6 billion, including a 16.8% core revenue decline, reflecting the significant negative
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Acquisitions contributed 270 basis points of growth, while unfavorable
foreign currency exchange rates reduced growth by 160 basis points.

Gross margins held up well in Q2 at 52%, supported by the growing contribution of our high-margin
software businesses. Gross margins also benefited from 70 basis points of price and disciplined supply
chain execution. Given the top line challenges, core operating margin decreased 220 basis points,
resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 20.2%. This adjusted operating margin reflected total
cost actions of greater than $100 million executed during the quarter in response to the widespread
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.

During the second quarter, we generated $454 million of free cash flow, representing conversion of 188%
of adjusted net earnings. This strong free cash flow performance reflected a proactive response taken
by our operating companies using FBS to improve inventory turns and accounts receivable, driving $165
million of tailwind from working capital in Q2. It also showed the increased resilience of free cash flow
generation across the portfolio driven by specific portfolio transformation actions taken over the past few
years.

Turning to our segments. Professional Instrumentation posted a total sales decline of 11%, including
a 14.4% decline in core revenue. Acquisitions contributed 450 basis points, while unfavorable foreign
exchange rates reduced growth by 110 basis points. Core operating margin decreased 140 basis points,
resulting in segment-level adjusted operating margin of 23.1%. Industrial Technologies posted a total
sales decline of 23.7%, including a 20.8% decline in core revenue. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange
rates reduced growth by 250 basis points. Core operating margin decreased 250 basis points, resulting in
segment-level adjusted operating margin of 19.6%.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Looking across the major geographies. Our performance in Q2 continued to be negatively impacted by
COVID-19 headwinds but was broadly better than expected. The region-by-region breakdown, as shown
on Slide 9 of the earnings presentation, ultimately reflected each region's relative progress in terms of
economic reopening as well as local public health dynamics as the quarter progressed.

In Asia, core revenue declined low double digits in Q2, representing a significant improvement from the
prior quarter, driven primarily by China. China was down mid-single digits in the quarter. We continue
to see steady signs of progress across our China businesses as they climb back from the low point
experienced back in February. All of our major businesses in China experienced significant sequential
improvement in Q2 with a number of operating companies, including Fluke and ASP, returning to year-
over-year growth. We were encouraged by the positive signs coming out of Q2, including improving point-
of-sale trends at Fluke and Tektronix and elective surgery volumes for ASP back to approximately 90% of
the levels that prevailed prior to the onset of the pandemic.

Looking across the rest of Asia. Japan likewise saw sequential improvement in Q2, while India and
Southwest -- Southeast Asia remain more challenging. India, in particular, saw severe economic lockdown
measures put into place for much of Q2. This significantly limited access to customers for sales and
marketing activities as well as services implementation.

Western Europe core revenue declined high teens in Q2. The quarter played out largely as expected,
with significant challenges through April and then sequential improvement in May and June as economies
began to reopen. The resulting top line for Western Europe was a bit better than expected in Q2,
particularly in light of relatively weaker trends in the region prior to the onset of the pandemic. Notably,
ASP posted low single-digit growth as strong terminal sterilization capital sales and incremental
consumable revenue from N95 respirator reprocessing helped offset a significant decline in total surgical
procedure volume. Demand trends for Fluke and Tektronix, while still down significantly, showed some
improvement over the course of the quarter.

North America core revenue also declined high teens in Q2. Similar to Western Europe, the U.S. bottomed
in April and then saw sequential improvement across May and June, resulting in a better-than-expected
high teens decline in total revenue. Improvement over the back half of the quarter was driven by the
widespread lifting of lockdown measures, although customer access remains limited in certain markets.
North America does benefit from the resilient performance of our software businesses, many of which
drive the majority of their revenue in the region and provide important stability in Q2. We believe
improving trends for elective surgical procedure volumes, continued EMV-related demand at GVR and early
signs of POS improvement at Fluke create the possibility for further sequential top line progress in the
coming quarters. That said, we continue to monitor the risks associated with rising COVID-19 infection
rates and hotspots across the country and any reimposition of lockdowns, which may be required.

Finally, we saw a mid-teens decline in the Middle East and a greater than 20% decline in Latin America.
Weakness in the Middle East reflected the combined impact of COVID-19 and budgetary pressures across
the region tied to challenging conditions in the oil and gas market. While Latin America experienced the
spread of COVID-19 a bit later than other regions, the impact became significant in Q2 with particular
headwinds for our businesses in Mexico and Brazil. We anticipate that conditions will likely remain
challenging throughout both these regions as we look through the end of the year.

Last quarter, we laid out a framework for analyzing our portfolio found on Slide 10 of today's presentation
with businesses organized into groups, based on relative sensitivity to pandemic disruption and resulting
deterioration in end market demand. As shown on Slide 11, the performance in Q2 across the 4 indicated
groups played out very much in line with our expectations for the quarter.

Group I, which represented approximately 14% of total revenue in Q2, showed significant resilience and
posted mid-single-digit growth for the quarter despite the challenging economic conditions. The group's
performance reflected a strong contribution from a number of our software businesses. Intelex grew mid-
teens, eMaint grew high single digits, Gordian was up slightly, and the SaaS and maintenance portion
of Accruent was relatively flat. Group I also benefited from very strong demand at Fluke's industrial
imaging business, where customer response to COVID-19 drove very strong growth in the quarter. We're

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

excited about the continued near-term demand trends for these product lines of Fluke and the potential to
accelerate a broader industrial imaging strategy.

As expected, Group II, which represents approximately 48% of total revenue in Q2, was significantly
impacted early in the quarter by lockdowns. Overall, the group's improvement over the back half of the
quarter resulted in mid-teens revenue decline, roughly 10 points better than expected. For ASP, surgical
procedure volumes in both the U.S. and Western Europe troughed at levels higher than those experienced
in China in Q1 and subsequently bounced back faster than expected to drive higher consumables usage
during the quarter.

At GVR, where bookings increased mid-single digits in the first half of the year, the pandemic impacted our
ability to convert orders to deliveries in Q2. Despite the pushout of the liability decline, we continue to see
strong demand for EMV upgrades in North America. Elsewhere in Group II, the recurring revenue business
models of ISC's iNet and Fluke Health Solutions' Landauer dosimetry business provided added resilience in
the second quarter. Fluke Health Solutions, which grew low single digits in Q2, also saw strong demand for
ventilator calibrators related to the fight against COVID-19.

Group III, which represented approximately 15% of total revenue in Q2, performed better than we had
anticipated in the second quarter with mid-teens decline. The group's performance is highlighted by Matco,
which saw significant pressure early in the quarter but then a strong recovery in orders as lockdowns
began to lift. Elsewhere, the Sensing portfolio saw pressure across a number of its core industrial end
markets. This was partially offset by growth in semiconductors, driven by demand for data center
upgrades and infrastructure as well as COVID-related tailwinds in medical end markets.

Specifically, Setra and Gems saw strong demand for critical environment, products and ventilator
components, respectively. Accruent's professional services business faced significant headwinds in the
quarter but adjusted with new safety protocols and remote delivery capabilities to help address COVID-19-
related restrictions and drive better performance later in the quarter.

Group IV, which represented approximately 23% of total Q2 revenue, experienced the most top line
pressure in the quarter as expected and posted an almost 30% decline. That said, businesses in Group
IV showed earlier signs of improvement than we had anticipated in April. Notably, Fluke's core industrial
business saw improvement in point-of-sale across its major regions with Asia POS positive in Q2 and
Europe and the U.S. improving off their early Q2 lows. The Tektronix instruments business performed
largely as expected in the second quarter with sequential improvement in China. Conditions remain
challenged, but we anticipate some sequential improvement at Tek in the second half.

The combination of top line resilience, strong margin execution and substantial cash flow generation
enabled us to continue to enhance our liquidity position and pay down debt as expected during the second
quarter. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet in addition to our undrawn
$2 billion revolving credit facility.

While there were plenty of immediate challenges to address in Q2, we continue to play offense across
our portfolio, running our FBS playbook by using dynamic resource allocation to invest in key growth
initiatives to enhance our long-term competitive position. We remain focused on driving innovation
across the portfolio using the FORT, our centralized artificial intelligence and data analytics hub, to bring
more advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities to bear in our workflow solutions while also
expanding our use of the growth accelerator process to fund potential growth breakthrough opportunities.

In May, we established a partnership with Pioneer Square Labs to help incubate industrial technology
companies capable of bringing new products to market in an accelerated fashion in addition to our internal
development processes. Sustained investment has enabled our operating companies to quickly address
emerging opportunities, including the growing demand for critical environmental solutions, et cetera,
and industrial imaging products at Fluke, driven by the response to COVID-19. Sustained investment
has also enabled the completion of longer-term development of critical next-generation products such as
Teletrac Navman's newly introduced TN360 telematics platform, which is expected to form a core part of
its offering going forward.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Importantly, we are also investing to expand our commercial operations, particularly among our software
businesses. We continue to expand Intelex' European sales team to help capitalize on growth opportunities
outside the U.S. and build the capability of Censis to address attractive opportunities emerging in the
ambulatory surgery center market.

At ASP, despite challenges reaching customers in the quarter, our continued investment in sales and
service enabled the team to quickly address the near-term N95 respirator reprocessing opportunities.

Despite the better trends we saw coming out of Q2, macro conditions remain challenging with the
potential for future volatility. This is particularly in light of persistent challenges associated with global
efforts to keep COVID-19 infection rates under control. Consistent with Q2, we are not providing a guide,
but we are providing additional color on expected performance for the coming quarter.

We expect that total revenue will improve sequentially in Q3 but decrease by 5% to 8% on a year-on-year
basis. We will continue to calibrate any remaining cost actions based on the top line progression from here
as we manage the decremental margins of approximately 35% in Q3. As we look ahead, we also expect
to continue to generate strong free cash flow and deliver a free cash flow conversion ratio of greater than
110% of adjusted net earnings for the full year.

The second quarter of 2020 was truly an unprecedented period as we had to quickly adjust to an unfolding
global public health crisis and a resulting deterioration of the global macroeconomic environment. We
weathered the storm, delivering financial performance that significantly exceeded our expectations 3
months ago. As such, our Q2 performance demonstrated the progress we have made with our portfolio
transformation over the past 4 years, establishing a more resilient top line and sustained cash flow
performance through the cycle. More importantly, as we leverage the foundation of FBS to sustain our
performance and develop new virtual collaboration tools, we continue looking forward by making the
investments in innovation and team development that will lay the groundwork for the continuation of our
portfolio transformation.

Finally, I am extremely proud of our team's efforts over the past 3 months. And while we undoubtedly face
additional challenges in the coming quarters, I'm confident in our ability to navigate through them as we
continue to generate substantial value for our employees, customers, shareholders and our communities.

With that, I'd like to turn it over to Griffin.

Griffin Whitney
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Nicole, we're now ready for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Obviously, the 3Q sales range of down 5% to 8% is obviously quite a bit better than what you're pointing
towards in April and what you've realized in the quarter. So I'm just curious how -- and I don't exactly
want to go blow by blow here. But as we went through June, July, were you seeing, not necessarily by
business, but just generally, what do you see in terms of organic sales progression as we went through the
quarter and into July?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Nigel. Yes, I think a couple of things relative to the trends. I think we certainly -- as we sort of
said in the prepared remarks, progressively, things got better as we got through the quarter. So I think
every month got a little bit better, certainly, from a trend perspective. July is just in and is probably good
as well, but good in the sense of giving us confidence as to the guide. So I think the trends are certainly
getting better. I think it's difficult to necessarily know how long they'll continue, hence, the -- like through
the -- into the fourth quarter.

But I think as we look at the near-term trend, they look pretty good. And certainly, as we said, we have
a good sense of what EMV is going to look like in the back half. That's a driver, obviously. Matco getting
better is another example. So that really covers Industrial Tech. And on the Professional Instrumentation
side, elective surgery is still on the right trend. The software business is staying resilient. And certainly,
some of the POS trends at Fluke is starting to be a little bit better as well.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

And the decremental margins obviously were very encouraging. You seem to have a really good firm grip
on the cost management side of it. 35% decremental margin outlook for 3Q. I know you had confidence
that you could kind of maintain or kind of like bring back those gross margin decrementals into that range
you put out there. So should we think about 3Q, 4Q in that sort of 35% range? Or is there a scope for it to
be a little bit better in 4Q if we continue to see the improvement trends into 4Q?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Nigel, this is Chuck. I think what we're trying to say is that we will deliberately manage the business to
35% as we move forward. The top line is on a better trajectory. At least that's how it seems at this point
in time, and that's consistent with what we're guiding there. So we'll strike that balance of managing our
expenses and investing into the future that -- as we go forward. So 35% is the right number.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Congratulations on the book. Scott, congratulations on your book.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Yes. No, thank you. I hope it helps many people sleep. A couple of pages in, you're out like a light, right?
But no, thanks for that, Chuck. Everything looked pretty encouraging here overall, and I was trying to -- I
think it's probably our fifth or sixth earnings call today. So a little beaten up. But Chuck, you commented
on -- I'm sorry, Jim actually commented on the 70 basis points of price. And trying to get a sense, does
that 70 basis points generally come in that bucket of 35% recurring revenue where you're able to get a
little bit more pricing power? Or is there some other base-level price increase that you have across the
board?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We were really encouraged. We've had good price. And quite frankly, as you know, the comps on price
have been pretty good, too. So to get that, it was mostly in Professional Instrumentation in the quarter,
Scott. So I would say -- and certainly, the software businesses were part of that. But we had good price in
some of our key hardware businesses as well, like Fluke and Tek.

So I think across the board, as we think about our playbook, certainly on the expense side, we talked
about $100 million of cost reductions in the quarter, but also part of that playbook is trying to find
opportunity for price. And I think the teams did an exceptional effort in the quarter to drive where those
opportunities exist. They took advantage of them. And while I think -- and we will continue to do that
through the rest of the year

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Okay. Encouraging. And then the Vontier profit profile looked like the top line growth profile you gave at
the -- as far as the decrementals and overall profit and cash and such. Was that fairly consistent with the
rest of Fortive? Or was there some differences there?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

No. I think that the -- there's a little bit of difference in terms of when you look at actual operating
profit margin by a couple of hundred basis points between the 2 segments. But when you get to the
decrementals, I don't -- they don't behave all that different between the 2.

Operator

Our next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just circling back to the revenue outlook. So you're dialing in around about a 10-point less bad
year-on-year drop in the third quarter than what you saw in the second quarter. Is there any more detail
you could provide around that narrowing either on a segment basis for PI versus IT and/or on that Group I
to IV basis just to help us sort of understand what's driving that improvement?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Julian, think of it this way. As we look at the quarter that we just had and what's improving, IT is going
to improve a little bit more than PI. Both are going to improve sequentially. We've got -- if you think
about the IT, the Vontier group, you've got Matco really is continuing to show some strength there. And
then we've got that EMV secular trend that's going to be helping GVR. Those were impacted in Q2 by the
lockdown.

And as that gets released, that's really going to move that to more of a low single-digit -- down low single-
digit for Vontier. And when you look at Professional Instrumentation, I think that's sequentially going to

10

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

improve. That's where you're seeing some of these acquisitions doing really well and then again, getting a
little bit of a lift from the lockdown coming off. So I'd see that improving to down high single-digit in Q3.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then maybe a second question around the free cash flow. There was a big working cap tailwind in Q2.
Generally, in the first half, receivables in particular freed up $200 million plus of cash, I think. So maybe
help us understand what's happening with working capital in the second half as you're seeing this revenue
outlook improve and the extent to which you're seeing an improvement in the ASP business around that
free cash flow profile?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. Let me -- I'll take a shot at that, and then Jim will probably add a few comments. I think -- we think
the tailwind from working capital from Q1 to Q2 is about $165 million when you take a look at everything
in there. And I think that, that was just a lot of great work by our teams getting on things early, managing
inventory levels appropriately. It's an example of managing what you can manage, and that gave us good
push. And as you saw, cash flow overall was very strong at $450 million.

I think that what I would expect going forward, it really depends on how steep the sequential
improvement continues to be going into the second half. But I'd expect a little bit of a tailwind, but not
at the same level. It's probably maybe 1/2 to 1/3 of that coming back as a tailwind. Again, it really just
depends on how steep the increase quarter-over-quarter is.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Julian, I would just add a couple of things. Number one is we're really happy with what we saw relative to
free cash flow. A lot of times, we'll talk about those working capital tailwinds in a way that suggests that it
doesn't actively have to be managed. The last time I checked, customers weren't in a hurry to pay us last
quarter. So the work that we did, I think using FBS was really profound. It's also using it to capture and
keep those advantages once we get into a little bit of growth mode or less down, if you will.

I would say the second thing I'd add is when we look at the -- historically, we said we would preserve
somewhere in the 80 percent-ish range of free cash flow when we're in a down cycle, and we've been
talking about that for 4 years. And I think what you saw in the quarter and what you're going to see in the
year is better than that. Obviously, we're much better than that in the second quarter. We think we can --
we'll do better into the 90s for the full year.

So I think what you're seeing is the strength of the portfolio, the higher gross margins in PI, particularly
around software. I think our gross margins in PI for the quarter were around 56%. So the ability to derive
more free cash out of the portfolio given the changes, I think, also gives us some confidence that free
cash in the remaining part of the year will be good as well.

Just 2 for me, if I could. Just on Vontier on the timing. This market obviously has been extraordinarily
resilient. What is it that you're looking for or waiting for to make your decision on timing here?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Well, I think there's a couple of things we're looking for. One, we thought it was important obviously to get
out here with our Q2 results. And then we're just looking for continued stabilization in the market and less

volatility. And while we think that the trends are definitely going in the right direction, we probably need
to see a little bit more time here going forward to ensure that we're not looking for a week to get out.
We're looking for a little bit longer time period. But we're encouraged by the direction of -- the markets
are going right now.

And also, we're prepared to go. We're ready. And the Vontier is ready to separate. And we're still
convinced that the strategy is correct, and we're committed to the execution. So we're just waiting for a
little bit more time and stability.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And just thinking about investment, Jim. So to Chuck's point, you're actually managing to a decremental,
right? So sales are going to come in better, that's going to free up spending. You provided a couple of
examples here on what you're working on. Should we expect most of that delta is going into growth? Or
I would assume there's some restoration of just kind of temporary things that you had to kind of choke
down here in the second quarter.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean, Jeff, we think of our playbook really as, first and foremost, as we see some of those revenue
going down, if you will. We, first and foremost, think about the factory and supply chain alignment with
capacity and we're focused on managing gross margins. You saw good -- really good work on the part
of the teams to do that in the quarter. There's the temporary cost actions. There's the permanent set of
cost actions. And then there's this fourth part about dynamic resource allocation, which is moving money
around to the highest opportunities, which is I think where you're going at.

So we're managing the decrementals relative to those things. We're making decisions about temporary
and permanent cost reductions as we really understand the outlook more or less into 2021. And those
decisions are probably more in the coming months. But I think the most important thing where you're
going is we're really making sure we're funding the growth opportunities that are inevitably going to
create competitive advantage over time.

A good example is the FORT where we bring data analytics projects for the businesses. Our projects are
up 3x from where they were a year ago. So we're doing 3x the number of data analytics projects than we
were doing a year ago. I think that's a big focus. You're hearing a lot about digital transformation around
companies, and I think that's really the -- what we do at the FORT is leading that for both our operating
companies and some internal projects that we're doing for Fortive. So I think that's one example.

Maybe one other example is we're continuing to accelerate all of our investments in the software
businesses where a number of our software businesses are really able to take advantage of a lot of the
-- going back to work challenges that occur, the changes in facilities, the new safety -- health and safety
protocols that exist in facilities and buildings. And so a number of our -- we're really pivoting our solutions
and our feature sets at both Accruent and Gordian as well as at Intelex to really take advantage of those
opportunities. So a number of our increases in investment are going towards some of those things where
we have, I think, real good secular drivers over time.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Just one quick clarification, if I could. Chuck, that revenue color, I think, you gave to Julian's question.
Was that reported revenues? Or was that organic revenue commentary you were giving?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

It's organic, although we're lapping most of our acquisitions here, I think, except for maybe Censis. But
organic was my comment.

Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a question on Fluke. As we think about the business today, how much of it is sort of ex health? How
much of it is core industrial at this point? And at the core industrial business, what was the performance in
the quarter?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think when you look at the core industrial piece that's in that Group IV, which will be our sort of our
core industrial instrumentation, probably about 60-ish percent, I think maybe 2/3 probably in that range
or a little bit better.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Got you. Okay. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then just a question on software, just to clarify,
Gordian and Accruent performance. So am I correct that Gordian is a marketplace revenue model. So it's
just volume going through the platform is down, so that's what's impacting it? And Accruent, anything else
going on besides sort of license to SaaS transition to depress the revenue?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I think, yes, you're exactly right, in Gordian. So get that one first. The -- and really, it's
interesting, Andrew, their revenue model also very often requires some work on site with the customer
to get started. And obviously, with the stay-at-home orders, we were prevented from working with
customers in some cases. So there's some delays, but there's no -- we often get the question about new
construction. It's really not new construction. It's really changes that are going on in the facility.

So we think with everything going on with COVID and facility changes required around protocols that
ultimately, that business will come back. And as you said, the purchasing construction dollars will start
to flow back through Gordian, and ultimately, the revenue will be back in growth mode. They've been, as
you know, a double -- a strong double-digit grower for quite some time now. We still think we've got great
opportunity there.

Accruent, a little bit more complex in that regard. We saw some -- again, we're seeing a lot of good
growth in the businesses that are really tied to facilities and facilities management and really returning-
to-work assessment work, our high cloud opportunities, our EMS business, our connected health care
businesses, and Lucernex, which is our lease management business, continues to be good. So those
businesses are mostly the SaaS parts of the portfolio. And again, they're doing -- they're much more
resilient.

Where we saw the challenges at Accruent is really, one, on the license revenue side; and again, on the
managed service side. It got a little bit better, as we said in the prepared remarks, like some of the
managed services got better at the end of the quarter as we were able to get more on-site and be able to
do some of our work remotely. But I think that will continue to be -- we continue to think the SaaS part
of Accruent will be durable. And we're still getting back to getting -- working with customers on a regular
basis. And that's still work to be done through the third quarter, I'm sure.

Hope everyone's well. Just a couple of questions here from my end. I guess first on the businesses that
go through distribution, I guess, Fluke and Tek kind of come to mind first. How do you characterize kind of
sell-in versus sell-out? I think we've seen some supply chain delays and distributor destocking. We've seen
a bit of backlog carried in for some other short-cycle guys into the second half. How do you guys think you
score against that?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think we saw a little bit better point-of-sale trending at Fluke than we did at Tek. I would call Tek
more stable, whereas -- got it improved, but Fluke may be a little bit more of an improvement but still
negative. Our inventory positions have remained pretty much, I would say, flat to down. So no real
inventory build. So I think as we get into the second half, we don't anticipate any big issues relative to
inventory.

On the other hand, we don't expect really distributors to necessarily take on inventory. So everything
embedded in what we talked about for the guide for the third sort of assumes that sort of business as
usual trends continue around point of sale, which means they get a little bit better. But at the end of the
day, no big dramatic increases or decreases in inventory, nor any big swings on point of sale.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess Jeff took my question on Vontier timing, so I'll ask a different
one. On the 4 buckets that you're kind of breaking down the business in these days, obviously, those are
shifting around a little bit as the businesses are separated. But does this current environment give you any
kind of thought into how to manage M&A amongst those buckets? I mean do we just kind of -- should we
expect mostly buckets 1 and 2? Or are there room for maybe some more cyclical or choppy assets that
would have been later in this current environment but maybe still attractive for Fortive?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's a great question. I think obviously, if -- using the groupings as we have them, we clearly
have, I think, demonstrated a propensity over the last several years to be -- grow the lion's share of our
M&A deployed into mostly Group I and Group II. So I think that would -- I would say the trend is going to
-- that trend will continue.

That said, there are certain situations. I would cite PRUFTECHNIK as a deal we did last year for Fluke,
which had both a service and an instrument aspect to it that was really important to our overall Fluke
digital offering. So in that case -- and we got it at a very, very high ROIC.

So I think what you'll find is if we do make some of those decisions that are in Group III or Group IV,
they're going to tend to be ones in which we'd see the returns very high. But I would say, if you said,
let's talk about the lion's share of our capital allocation over the next several years, it's really going to be
in building in those groups that are articulated in I and II. And they're focused on things like condition
monitoring, facilities management, health care enablement and health, safety and environmental, the
places where we deployed the lion's share of our capital over the last 4 years.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Just a couple of questions. First, just around the recurring. Jim, I think you mentioned recurring
revenue, and I think you're including software and consumables and services, with 35% of Fortive's revs
in the quarter kind of new high. But how did that bucket, as you defined it there at 35% of revenue, how
did that do year-over-year in the second quarter?

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, I have to disaggregate it into the groups. But I would say if you thought about the sort of PI-related
software businesses, they were up about mid-single digit. And then obviously, telematics, the big software
business that we would have on the Vontier side, is down in the quarter. But as I mentioned, I think the
new platform that we're launching, we're excited about the opportunity for telematics here going forward.
So that kind of gives you the software view of what the quarter looked like.

Services, which are mostly in Group II buckets, probably sort of down to down. I think our dosimetry
business at Landauer was up in the quarter. But I think Tek services, as an example, was down low single
digits, something like that. So I probably would say the service parts of the business at Landauer, we call
that Fluke Health, and at Tek, probably down a little bit but still obviously much more resilient than the
other parts of the portfolio.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I got you. Okay. And then just a question. As we manage to this 35% decremental here for the balance of
the year, a question just is around as we manage into next year around what's discretionary on the cost
side, what our investments are on the cost side, how do you start to think about incrementals for PI and
Vontier? What do we manage to there? I mean we have more software content. We want more recurring
revenues. What would be the appropriate view on an incremental margin for PI and IT or Vontier?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. Rick, this is Chuck. I would think that a good starting place is that we'd come back up the same
amount that we went down because we want to reset back to starting to growing on our 2019. So
recovering that revenue, if it went down to 35%, think of it coming back to 35%. Beyond that, it really
depends on where we're growing. As you mentioned, some of our -- some of the software business
obviously have higher decrementals as you move forward in time. So it kind of depends after that, but
first thing is to get it back.

Our next question will come from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.

Joseph Craig Giordano

Can you kind of go through the cost out? You mentioned $100 million in this quarter. As you look to

temporary things that -- actions that you took that come back to the business when things are more
normal versus more permanent savings?

Are you talking about for the quarter or what you think we've done for the year?

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

I think the -- so in the quarter, I think that -- let me back up. It's a little easier to talk about for the year. I
think that the permanent that we're likely to take, we have taken action on, will be $50 million permanent
through the year. Obviously, [ that was ] in Q1 or in Q2, that $100 million is -- it's a little less than that.
But as you go through the year, think of it being $50 million in permanent actions. That's on top of the
actions we took in Q4 of last year, where we did [ at least about -- probably $60 million ].

And then as -- it really depends on -- let's see how the rest of the year plays out, particularly in Q4. But
I would expect the next quarter, we'll know -- obviously, we'll know how the third quarter played out
and have a strong view into next year and see if we need to do anything of a more permanent nature or
whether we think the top line is going to recover.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Joe, also part of that is, obviously, we're getting a substantial reduction in travel. And we're very much
working through now a number of our virtual and digital work that we're doing with customers to
understand how much of our real travel expenses, quite frankly, can become permanent cost reduction
because we just don't need to necessarily make the trips that we've historically made.

So I think as we think about once we have a better sense of what we think the revenue outlook will look
like in 2021, then we can certainly, as Chuck said, make that decision. But those decisions aren't just the
typical incentives and things like that, but it's also very much things like travel and costs that are -- that
would historically be considered temporary, but quite frankly, I think a significant amount of them are
going to be permanent as we move into next year.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That's fair. My follow-up, just wanted to talk on the elective procedure volumes you guys mentioned. It
was interesting. You said in North America, you're seeing 80% to 85%, 90% of pre-COVID. Some of the
checks we've did, it sounds like that rate is reflective of some of the kind of specialty hospitals, but like the
big hospitals were more like in the 75% range. And I'm just curious at how you kind of view -- is that --
is that geared toward more a specific type of facility? And how is that looking now with what's going on in
Florida and some of the places that are having flare-ups again?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So our prepared remarks may not have been as clear. So we see the China hospitals up at around
90%. And the U.S. hospitals, we're getting back. I think our numbers would, quite frankly, agree with
yours at the end of the quarter in the sort of 70%, 80% range. We get pretty good data from our Censis
software business [indiscernible] sterilization. We not only have the understanding of what the procedures
are, but we have an understanding of sterilization. We think that continues to get back as we get through
the quarter, but we don't see it to 100% even through the end of the third quarter, I don't think.

Still a long way to go between now and then, but we definitely think it continue to see -- we really get the
data by day. And we are seeing -- we're seeing continued improvement through July as well. So we think
things will continue to [indiscernible]. But as you said, it is a little bit of type of facility-dependent.

Our next question will come from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Jim, maybe you could give us a little more color into your regional sales breakdown. You mentioned your
China-related sales were down, still down mid-single digits in Q2. Does that turn positive in Q3? And as
you think about the revenue outlook improvement in Q3 versus Q2, are all regions generally improving at
the same rate? Or do you see, for instance, Lat Am or even the U.S. lagging the other regions?

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think, as you said, China was measurably better in Q2 than Q1. I wouldn't -- and that was on the
backs of ASP and Fluke. I think China is going to get better through the second half, but I don't necessarily
think that China gets to any dramatic growth rate in the second half. I think it gets better, but I don't think
we've seen enough to think that things are going to get significantly better. So I think our China theory
here at this point is probably better.

The rest of Asia, I think, is a little mixed. As we mentioned, India continues to have a lot of lockdowns.
And -- but we think by the end of the year, our India business, in many respects, is driven by the GVR
business. And we think that there's a number of things that -- the order pattern there has been very good.
So we think India might get better by the end of the year.

I think as we think about the Middle East, we think about Latin America, we don't anticipate anything
getting better there. So that kind of gives you the high-growth market view.

The U.S. will definitely get better through the remaining part of the year. I think the -- and I would
anticipate -- whereas I don't necessarily see Western Europe getting that much better the rest of the year.
And the difference there is we have the EMV tailwind in the U.S. We have Matco getting better in the U.S.
We have ASP getting better, which is a bigger U.S. business than it does a European business. And Fluke's
point-of-sale is getting better. So I would say North America tends to get better through the remaining
part of the year.

And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Western Europe, in particular, wasn't ripened to begin
with when we sort of started with COVID. And I anticipate that to be a little bit more longer drawn out
recovery. Hope to be proven wrong there, but that would sort of be our sort of thought process as we get
into the second half here.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Jim, let me ask my follow-up on GVR specifically. You mentioned India. It does tend to be lumpy for you
guys, and you tend to see delays sometimes in orders. And obviously, we know what's going on there
in terms of the infections. So maybe confidence level in the international GVR business doing better in
the second half of the year. And then you talked about mid-single-digit order growth in North America.
Does that just convert in the second half of the year as stay-at-home orders have basically -- I mean
they haven't gone away, they're a little better in the second half of the year. Does that just convert into
revenue growth in North America?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think North America orders will continue to be good in the second half. It's a little mixed around the
world. As you know, in the rest of the world, a number of our customers are integrated oil companies. And
so oil and gas prices has a little bit more impact in some parts of the world than it does in the U.S., where
that's a disaggregated market. So I do think the second half will still follow some of those patterns that I
was describing relative to the economy.

But I think India, in particular, will continue. I think our position in India is very good. We've done a
number of acquisitions there, our Orpak acquisition, our Midco acquisition. We have a very good position.
We've got great relationships with customers. So I'm confident. As you said, it can be lumpy quarter-to-
quarter. But if we look year on year-on-year, we've built a really good business there, and I'm confident
that the team will continue to execute there.

So I think some of the other markets might be -- we did a Middle East review with the team the other day
for all of Fortive. And I think they're executing well there. And some markets are going to continue to be
okay. So I think GVR, in general, will -- it will depend on the market and country, but I think we'll see a

The next question will come from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I'm interested in hearing a bit more about this joint venture with Pioneer Square Labs. It sounds like
you've got your first company getting launched. Could you remind us what kind of investments that you're
making in this, what kind of returns you're expecting? And this really does sound something more than
just a proxy for R&D.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's -- we're really excited about it. We've built a very good relationship with them and the team
there. What it really is, is we agree on an idea generation process. We devote -- we have a number of
Fortive people that work at the lab alongside the PSL team. We generate ideas. If we find an idea that
we want to invest in, we invest in it. We have a couple of different milestones where we can decide if we
want to bring that in or continue to invest in it. And at a certain point in time, we draw a conclusion as to
whether or not we want to own it or necessarily do something that -- obviously do something and take it
out. And I think the economics are good for both parties, and we feel very good about the relationship.

So it's still very early days. They bring a lot of great entrepreneurship, fast cycle product development,
lots of software experience. I think we've been -- I think they've been very enthusiastic in the level and
quality of talent that we brought to the table. But still very early days. As we said, we've launched one
team. And hopefully, we'll continue to have a number of wins and -- that we can put on -- put up over the
next few years.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Will these businesses be spun out, sold with -- are there synergies within core Fortive? Just maybe kind of
explain how the company benefits from this overall.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it could be all of the above. It could be a great idea that really benefits Fortive. And we see a
way to spin that in, and we've got economics associated with that so that we can spin it in and bring it and
make it part of Fortive. But we also have the economics, if it's a great idea, but not -- isn't necessarily that
would be something consistent with what Fortive wants to become. And ultimately, we would decide to do
something to spin that out as well.

So there are a number of options. I think we've got good flexibility as to the kinds of ideas and what is
sort of in our strike zone. But also, obviously, if there's ideas that have maybe utilized Fortive technology
but don't necessarily mix with what we want to do and become, then ultimately, we'll try to find other
ways to create value and spinning it out and building something in a different structure.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And just as a second question, I want to go back to this structure of these 4 groups that you've set
up. And just, Jim, a few minutes ago, you said that you're really not looking to commit capital necessarily
into Groups III and IV, except on those situations where you're getting higher returns. But once you start
saying you're not investing further in M&A for those businesses, it kind of opens up the question that there
might be some noncore businesses opportunities to exit. I know you've got some Vontier businesses there

already, and those decisions have been announced. But are there businesses in Groups III and IV that
might be considered noncore?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, no, I think what I meant with that answer is one of the things that we love about that grouping is I
think it gave everybody a good perspective of how -- it was really meant to show the sequencing of how
our parts of our businesses would perform and mirror sort of the resiliency and dynamics of COVID and
the economic consequences of COVID. So it's really a framework for that.

As you know, a number of our businesses are really built with portions of Group I, II, III and IV all
together. So just taking an example like Fluke, as we said before, a good chunk of Fluke is in Group I and
II, is in I and II, so -- and increasingly becoming a growing part of that. So I don't think it necessarily says
that our individual businesses are necessarily going to be not invested in. But what we're going to find in
a number of our businesses -- within our businesses or within our operating companies, probably is the
best words, is we're finding those opportunities to build more resilient, more durable, more higher growth
aspects of the business. And that's where we'll probably end up having more of our investment.

So as Fluke is a good example, we bought EMA, we bought PRUFTECHNIK, but we also bought Landauer.
So a good chunk of the capital that we deployed into Fluke in the last few years has been to add those
1s and 2s to the core Fluke business. I think we have those same opportunities for some of the parts of
Group III and IV that we can also do. Even within Sensing Tech, some of the things we talked about that
are driving the growth there and environmental monitoring as another example. Those are places where
we're investing in those businesses because those parts of the businesses really have Group II and Group
I aspects to them.

Our next question will come from the line of John Walsh with Crédit Suisse.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So a lot of ground covered. I guess just thinking about the SaaS businesses, was there any discernible
change, positive or negative, across them as it relates to customer retention rates? I think that might be
the best way to ask the question versus kind of thinking about net adds. But however you kind of want to
answer, it's helpful.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We really -- the key metric we look at, John, is net retention. And that combines sort of not churning
customers, keeping current customers. And that metric is really -- and all of our SaaS businesses
improved in that metric in the quarter. So it's a key metric we keep an eye on. We actually review those
metrics with the Board in every Board meeting. They're so important.

So I think we feel very good about the work the team is doing on all those metrics, and there's still lots of
-- there's certainly improvement to get -- and some of our businesses are kind of at benchmark. Some of
them still have some ways to go. So we're -- it's a continued focus for a lot of our FBS tools as well within
those businesses.

Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Everything is kind of picked over, but I have one last one that I wanted to squeeze in, is on your -- you
commented that you saw some strong demand for industrial imaging products within the Fluke business.
Some of your competitors kind of in that niche vertical are seeing really strong demand, exponential
growth as it relates to skin temperature, cameras. Is this -- is that what you guys are referencing? And if
you could just comment more on that, if that's an area that could see outsized growth within PI.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Andrew, our principal business there is thermal imaging and temperature measurement. So it ranges
from all the imaging line as well -- thermal imagers as well as literally IR guns and thermometers. So
yes, that business is doing well, and it also has a number of new entrepreneurial opportunities that
we're working on that do sort of fold into some of the challenges that happened at facilities relative to
COVID-19.

So we think -- we mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks that we're excited about a broader
strategy here. We've got some people counting business that is part of an acquisition we had a few years
ago that we're building a solution out that we've launched. So a number of things that we've got going,
and we'll see how it goes. And whether it's sort of -- whether the -- we really think the resiliency and
durability that we might be able to build here is beyond just COVID-19, and we're excited to try to build
on that here in the coming quarters.

The next question will come from the line of John Inch with Gordon.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

You can hear me now. Okay. Great. Sorry about that. Technology, right? I was wondering given, Chuck, to
inform kind of your comments about North America getting better and so forth, is the implication that this
is an impact from COVID flaring up and surging in the southern states in California or that you are seeing
impact but other aspects of the business are superseding that? Like how to think about this? Because what
you're describing isn't that dissimilar from other industrial companies. So I'm just curious kind of what
you're seeing on ground kind of regionally and how that plays out.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

I would see the 2 biggest places, John, where we see COVID impact relative to, call it, daily stuff or maybe
the 3 places is really in the hospitals and sterilization procedures that we described a little while ago.
It's getting Matco equipment in the ground -- or sorry, getting GVR equipment in the ground and really
the Matco ability to call on customers every day. So I think as we look through -- and those are big U.S.
businesses as well. So those are kind of COVID-related.

The point-of-sale stuff at Fluke is really economic-related. You want to see better PMIs, better IP numbers.
So -- and that's probably a global point for Fluke. But -- so what we're really watching for is the surgery
numbers, the ability to not go back into lockdown.

As we mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, the lockdown really impacted Matco. April was a
really tough month. But it -- as soon as things started to open up, it accelerated back to what we would
normally call a pretty resilient business, quite frankly, historically, relative to economic cycles. And I think I

saw today that average car ownership years is at the highest point it's ever been, which is a good thing for
Matco.

So I think that's what we're watching for. We don't want to see hospitals close back down. We don't want
to see cities get back into lockdown mode, where they won't be -- where auto repair shops aren't open or
that construction can't occur and sites can't be upgraded for Gilbarco.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Yes. No, that makes sense. And then just maybe as a follow-up, Jim, how are you thinking about kind of
strategically further M&A? And I ask it in the context of, is this going to be somewhat contingent on the
Vontier separation and getting that dividend from Vontier to do the reload and lower the debt-to-cap or
debt-to-EBITDA thresholds back again? Or are the 2 somewhat disassociated in terms of the tracks, i.e.,
one of them is not necessarily contingent on the other?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think first and foremost, we always said this year would be a bolt -- more likely a bolt-on year
because of digesting a number of things that we did last year as well. And I think that's been our thesis,
although you never can be -- we've looked at some fairly sizable things. So I think at the end of the day,
we've continued to be busy.

I think there continues to be a couple of things that are impacting the M&A market. I know some of our
peers have talked about this. One is the bid-ask spreads are still not in alignment necessarily. It's hard to
distinguish the COVID impact from things, and that takes sometimes an additional quarter or 2 of results
to work through with a seller. The second piece of it, it's just harder to do due diligence, right? We can't
get on-site in many cases. We can't meet people.

And so I think things are slower by nature of those 2 aspects. And then -- but I think we've been busy. We
continue to think that there's opportunity. I wouldn't necessarily say that it's tied to the Vontier separation
but -- because of the fact that really, we never were really tying those things together to begin with. But
certainly, Vontier, certainly, when we complete the Vontier transaction, it certainly gives us more firepower
and more opportunity.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

By the way, just when you say bigger, do you mean bigger bolt-on? Or you mean bigger as in something
that's fee related?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, it means the things that were bigger. I mean we haven't necessarily said we're not going to do
anything because there are certain things that we've been cultivating for several years. And we can't say,
"Hey, do you mind selling at a different time?" So things are going to sell when they're going to sell, and
we have to be responsive to that. But we're obviously taking into account the economic conditions and all
the things that might impact returns.

So it's a complicated answer, hence, maybe too many words here. But I think at the end of the day, we're
focused on making sure we can create value in a focused, prioritized way that probably ends up being
more bolt-ons than not. But we are -- we do have our ear to the railroad if there's other opportunities.

Our final question will come from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.

Just wanted to ask 2 questions. You told us that price was up 70 basis points. Was -- were materials lower
than that? Were you positive on the price cost side?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Scott, yes is the short answer. There's a good -- we have our teams, procurement professionals. And they
do a good job every year, and this is no different.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Got you. And then the second one is the Group III and Group IV. So the sales on those businesses, a
little bit heavier. And the second quarter was kind of all about lockdowns, and people were doing break
and fix as needed, which tends to be higher-margin type of sales. So I'm just wondering, was that the
case for you guys in the quarter -- in the second quarter, sort of the as-needed stuff, which maybe helped
enrich the mix, particularly in PI? Or was that not the case? Because I'm just wondering if that's maybe a
headwind 2 quarters from now.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

No, not at all. I think when we look at what -- really, we have a very tight margin spread in our product
lines. This is the power of FBS, quite frankly. So we don't necessarily distinguish that. The price metric
really has to do with the fact that as we said from time to time that our high-valued brands are critical at
these times for everyone. And so I don't think -- I'm looking across the groups right now and trying to
think of where I could point to where I could think of a margin situation that might be different from what
I just commented, and I can't find one.

So I think we'll -- more consumables is obviously higher margin. More Matco is higher margin. So a
number -- obviously, the software businesses are high margins, but they're some of our newer businesses.
So they don't necessarily represent the highest operating profit margin. So I think as our core businesses
come back that, in some respects, you might suggest, is certainly a help as we look at margin expansion
in the -- over the next year or so.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Understood. Nice quarter.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Thank you.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP, CFO & Interim Principal Accounting Officer

Thanks, John.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think that concludes it, everybody. Thanks so much for going overtime with us. We appreciate
it. I know it's a challenging time for everyone. I hope that your families are safe and your -- and work
is going well for all of you as we all try to manage the challenges of working virtually. We certainly are
incredibly proud of the work we've done. I couldn't say enough about our 25,000 employees around the
world who've just done an incredible job at making Fortive just have a very strong quarter, but more
importantly, building the business for what we envision in the years to come. So thanks for taking the time
with us, and we look forward to the calls. Obviously, everybody is available for calls afterwards. Thanks.
Have a great evening.
