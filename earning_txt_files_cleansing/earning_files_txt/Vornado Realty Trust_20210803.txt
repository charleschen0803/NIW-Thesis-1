VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Vornado Realty Trust Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. My name
is Hilda, and I will be your operator for today's call. This call is being recorded for replay purposes. Our
speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the question-and-answer
session. [Operator Instructions]

I will now turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Creswell, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Catherine C. Creswell
Director of Investor Relations

Thank you. Welcome to Vornado Realty Truck Second Quarter Earnings Call. Yesterday afternoon, we
issued our second quarter earnings release and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. These documents as well as our supplemental financial information package
are available on our website, www.vno.com, under the Investor Relations section.

In these documents and during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our
earnings release, Form 10-Q and financial supplement. Please be aware that statements made during
this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from these
statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for more information regarding these risks and
uncertainties. The call may include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's
date. The company does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.

On the call today from management for our opening comments are Steven Roth, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer; and Michael Franco, President and Chief Financial Officer. Our senior team is also
present and available for questions.

I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, Cathy, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone is healthy, continues to be vigilant and
gets vaccinated. Let me say it again. Everybody, please get vaccinated.

I'll start by sharing a few things that are happening on the ground, which I hope you all find interesting.
The U.S. economy is resilient, it's growing. I might even say is booming, and so is New York. Financial,
tech and almost all industries are achieving record results. In New York, apartment occupancy, which had
dropped to as low as 70% during COVID, is now rapidly climbing back with record numbers of new leases
being signed each week at higher and higher rents.

Condo sales, which had stalled during COVID, are now active, albeit at discounted pricing, except I'm
proud to say that our 220 Central Park South where resales are at a premium. This apartment and condo
demand is coming from folks who live and work in New York, and that's a very good sign.

At 220 Central Park South, where we are basically sold out, resale pricing is up, and that's an
understatement. A recent spectacular example, which is now public, is a 2-floor 12,000 square foot resale
that traded at a record-breaking $13,000 per square foot, think about that.

Our New York office division is now experiencing record incoming RFPs and requests for tours, including
from many large and important occupiers who had been on the sidelines during COVID. Glen and his

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

team are very busy. By the way, Big Tech is now very active looking for more space in New York to take
advantage of New York's large, highly educated and diverse workforce.

Here's an interesting fact, a Fortune 100 occupier household name who dropped out of the market during
COVID has come back to market. They were originally looking for 300,000 square feet to house 2,800
employees. Post-COVID, after extensive study and space planning, they now need and are seeking
400,000 square feet, a 30% increase to house the same 2,800 employees.

In both instances, their projected in-office occupancy is the same 60%. The fact that this occupier needs
30% more space post-COVID is contrary to all analyst expectations, but that is the fact. And we are
hearing the same from many, although not all, but many of our tenants that they will need more space,
not less post-COVID.

One of our analysts and a friend recently wrote that our company suffers from [ PENN ] fatigue, true. It
took us over a decade to assemble our vast PENN District hoardings, but as the same goes, this is our
time. Here's where we stand. At Farley, we have delivered to Facebook all of their 730,000 square feet.
Their tenant work is going full bore.

The West Side of Seventh Avenue, along the 3 blocks stretching from 31st Street to 34th Street, is now a
massive construction site, where we are transforming the 4.4 million square foot PENN 1 and PENN 2 into
the nucleus of our cutting-edge connected campus. The 34th Street PENN 1 lobby just opened, and our
unrivaled 3-level amenity offering will be completed at year-end.

Our full building PENN 2 transformation, including the bustle and reskinning, is 98% bought out on budget
and off to a fair start. We couldn't be more excited. Our 14,000 square foot sales center the Seventh Floor
of PENN 1 is now open to rate reviews from brokers and occupiers. It's busy. It is that -- the sales office
is designed as a dealmaking conference and presentation center with multiple building models and videos
that tell our story in a clear, persuasive and unique way.

After working with Glen and Josh in the sales center, the market is understanding our ambitious plans to
make the PENN District, the crown jewel of the west side of the new New York. By the way, every quarter
and every year, the West side is punching way above its weight, measured by high and growing leasing
share -- market share of leases signed.

The aside of our confidence and the market's enthusiasm, even at this early date, we are raising our PENN
asking rents. We will shortly begin demolition of the Hotel Pennsylvania to create the best development
site in town. We expect demolition and shutdown costs to be about $150 million, which you should look at
as land cost. Our book basis in this property today is $203 million. And we are midstream in the process to
make the unique high-growth PENN District a separate investable public security.

Our best in the business team leaders in the PENN District are Glen Weiss Leasing, Barry Langer
Development and [ Dave Mandelbaum ] Construction. Michael will cover our operating results in a
moment, but I can say that, overall, leasing and occupancy statistics in New York tell a misleading story.
While overall availability is 18%, assets newly built or repositioned since 2000 have a much lower direct
vacancy rate of 11%.

Last quarter, 88% of new leasing activity in Midtown was a Class A product. It's clear that the market is
voting for new and repositioned assets As you would expect, Class A assets command higher pricing than
Class B, in fact, 1/3 higher. Obviously, this is the place to be and you should know that substantially all of
our assets are repositioned and in this competitive set.

New York is coming back to life. Residential neighborhoods are bustling, less so the commercial
[ canyons ] where office utilization is now approximately 23%. Remember, it's August, the vacation
month. The largest employers in Manhattan have mandated a return to work by Labor Day or shortly
thereafter, some with full staff in office and others with a flexible program allowing some work from home.

As I have said before, I do not believe that the office will be threatened by the kitchen table. And I do not
believe that even 1 or 2 work from home days per week by some number of a tenant's employees will be a
negative to us.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

I, for one, I'm unable to predict whether it will take a month or a quarter for office buildings to be back to
full up and the canyons to be teeming again. There is no magic date. All that matters is that it will happen
soon enough. Last week, we announced that Wegmans, the premier grocer in the Northeast region, is
opening its first store in Manhattan at our 770 Broadway replacing Kmart. And you can bet that we will do
several more Manhattan deals with Wegmans.

The fact that Wegmans is coming is creating excitement with it at last count, 43 print and broadcast press
articles celebrating the announcement. Here is an interesting fact to it. Wegmans expects that as much
as 50% of its volume will be from in-home delivery -- appropriately from to home delivery. We will be
investing $13 million in TIs, leasing commissions and free rent in this long-term lease with a 65% GAAP
mark-to-market increase over Kmart's rent.

This quarter, we announced that we exercised a ROFO to acquire our partner's 45% interest in One Park
Avenue in a transaction that values the building at $870 million. Based on the in-place floating rate loan,
we project $18 million, $0.09 cents per share first year accretion.

Last summer, we brought 555 California Street to market for sale and are unable to achieve fair value, we
withdrew, understandable at the height of COVID with travel restrictions and so forth.

At that time, we said we will refinance and this past quarter, we did to the tune of [ $1.2 billion ] netting
us approximately $467 million at share. We can just carry on the new floating rate loan is almost exactly
the same as the old much smaller fixed rate loan. So one might say the $460 million is free money.
Ironically, I believe, continuing to own this outstanding asset with this superb accretive financing is
actually a better outcome.

In New York replacement cost is rising quickly over the past many decades, replacement costs with a
dip here and there has risen relentlessly. And if past this is pro-log, replacement costs will undoubtedly
continue to rise as far as the eye can see. Replacement cost has always been a key predictor of future
value a rising umbrella lifting all similar real estate values.

And New York is the poster child of this phenomenon. Here is updated guidance for our retail business.
For 2021, we guided cash NOI of $135 million. And now halfway through the year, we expect to do a little
bit. For 2022, we guided cash NOI of $160 million, which we affirm. For 2023, we announced new cash
NOI guidance of not less than $175 million. You should know that, as expected, Swatch exercised the
termination option for a portion of their space at St. Regis, which is effective March 2023 with a $9 million
termination fee.

The Swatch owned Harry Winston store will remain under lease through its June 2031 expiry. The
guidance above takes account of the Swatch termination. If I were a betting man, and I guess in some
ways, I am, I would bet that we have already put in the bottom in New York that the worst of the best
stuff is behind us and that New York will get better and better and so will New York real estate in space. In
our case, occupancy rate, TIs and pricing have bottomed.

Finally, we have a great talented leasing, development and operations team, all thanks to them. Thank
you. Now to Michael.

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our second quarter financial results and
end with a few comments on the leasing and capital markets. Second quarter comparable FFO as adjusted
was $0.69 per share compared to $0.56 for last year's second quarter, an increase of $0.13. We have
provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge for you in our earnings release on Page 5 and in our financial
supplement on Page 7.

The increase was driven by the following items: $0.09 from tenant-related activities, including
commencement of certain lease expansions and nonrecurrent or straight-line rent write-offs impacting
the prior period, primarily JCPenney and New York & Company; $0.02 from lower G&A resulting from our

overhead reduction program; and $0.02 from interest expense savings and the start of improvement in
our variable businesses, primarily from BMS, [ claim ].

Our second quarter comparable results are consistent with the fourth quarter run rate we discussed at the
beginning of the year as is our overall expectation for the full year. Speaking of our variable businesses,
we are beginning to see signs of recovery with a return to normalcy. BMS is nearing pre-pandemic levels.
Signage is starting to pick up with healthy bookings in the second half of the year. Our garages are picking
up as well and should be fully back in 2022. And finally, we have a number of trade shows scheduled for
the fourth quarter.

Other than Hotel Penn's income, we expect to recover most of the income from our variable businesses
by year-end 2022 with the balance in 2023. Company-wide same-store cash NOI for the second quarter
increased by 0.5% over the prior year second quarter. Our core New York office business was up 3.2%.
Blending in Chicago and San Francisco, our office business overall was up 2%. Consistent with prior
quarters, our core office business, representing over 85% of the company, continues to hold its own,
protected by long-term leases with credit tenants.

Our retail same-store cash NOI was down 6%, primarily due to JCPenney's lease rejection in July 2020.
But excluding the impact of JCPenney's lease rejection, the same-store cash NOI for the remaining retail
business was up 9.8%. Our office occupancy ended the quarter at 91.1%, down 2 percentage points from
the first quarter. This was expected and driven by long expected move-out at 350 Park Avenue and 85
Tenth Avenue as well as 825 Seventh Avenue coming back into service. With the activity we have in our
pipeline, this quarter should represent the bottom of our office occupancy, and it should improve quarter-
by-quarter from here. Retail occupancy was up slightly to 77.3%.

Now turning to the leasing markets. Since our last call, the pace of office leasing activity in New York City
has picked up each successive month. With the vaccination rates high, companies are now fully focused on
their return to the office with many returning during the summer and a majority expected back soon after
Labor Day. Predictably, the overall sentiment in New York continues to improve as company's return and
the office market continues to heal.

During the second quarter, leasing volume in Manhattan was its highest since the onset of the pandemic.
And office tour activity has now exceeded pre-pandemic levels with more than 11 million square feet of
active tenant requirements.

Importantly, office-using employment in the city continues to strengthen. With more than 100,000 jobs
now recovered, we're at 92% of the pre-pandemic peak. While leasing volume during the first half of 2021
was dominated by small to medium-sized transactions, driven by well-capitalized financial services and
technology tenants, we are now seeing pent-up demand from larger occupiers across all industry types
as many have formally entered the market. There are additional signals that the market continues to
[ thaw ].

Tenants are now entering into leases for longer terms and asking rents in concessions have stabilized. And
in fact, as Steve alluded to, we have recently increased our asking rents in our top-tier assets; reflecting
the strong demand for best-in-class assets. During the second quarter, we signed 33 leases, totaling
322,000 square feet, with 2/3 coming from new companies joining our high-quality portfolio across the
city.

The average starting rent of these transactions was a strong $85 per square foot. The leasing highlight for
the quarter was 100,000 square feet at PENN 1, further validating the market's resounding reception to
our redevelopment of this property. The largest transaction was a new lease with Empire Healthchoice for
72,000 square feet. Our main competition here was newly constructed buildings in both Downtown and
Midtown, our new dramatic lobbies in Plaza's best-in-class campus amenity program and premier access to
transportation [indiscernible].

Looking towards the second half of 2021, our leasing pipeline has grown significantly since last quarter
with more than 1 million square feet of leases in active negotiation, including 180,000 square feet of new
leasing at 85 Tenth Avenue, as well as an additional 1.6 million square feet in various stages of discussion.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

This includes discussions with several large users newly interested in PENN 2 after seeing our vision at the
Experience Center. Our activity is a balanced combination of new and renewal deals with the majority of
our activity with companies in the financial, technology and advertising sectors.

Our office expirations are very modest for the remainder of 2021 and 2022, with only 976,000 square feet
expiring in total, representing 7% of the portfolio, and 150,000 of this square footage is in PENN 1 and
PENN 2. As we look toward our 2023 expirations of 1.9 million square feet, of which 350,000 is in PENN 1
and PENN 2, we are, of course, already in dialogue and trading paper with many of these companies and
anticipate announcing important transactions by year-end.

Now turning to theMART in Chicago, where the office market is also showing signs of life, and tenant
demand is returning coming out of the pandemic. While short-term renewal leasing dominated the market
during 2020, activity has picked up with almost 1 million square feet of new leasing completed during the
second quarter, though concessions are unusually high.

At theMART, we completed a 91,000 square foot long-term office renewal with 1871. Chicago's premier
technology incubator for entrepreneurs and have an additional 80,000 square feet of new deals in
negotiation.

Two weeks ago, we produced our first trade show at theMART since February 2020 pre-pandemic. This
show in partnership with International Casual Furniture Association featured the largest manufacturers of
outdoor furniture in the country. Attendance was 10% higher than the same show produced pre-pandemic
2019, and feedback from exhibitors and attendees was very positive. We have 8 upcoming trade shows
calendared during the remainder of 2021, including NeoCon in October, the largest show in North America
focused on commercial design, though we don't expect the tenants to reach 2019 levels this year. In San
Francisco at 555, we are finalizing a couple of small, strong leases in our [ fall ] other than the cube.

Turning to the capital markets now. The financing markets are wide open and aggressive for high-quality
office companies and buildings, and we are taking advantage of the low all-in coupons. It bears repeating
that in May, we upsized our 555 California Street loan from $533 million to $1.2 billion with no additional
interest costs.

We also reentered the unsecured debt market for the 2 tranche $750 million green bond offering at a
blended yield of 2.77%. There was robust demand for our paper, underscoring investor support for our
franchise and belief in New York City. We paid off the loan on theMART with the proceeds and added the
remainder to our treasury.

Finally, our current liquidity is a strong $4.492 billion, including $2.317 billion of cash and restricted cash
and $2.175 billion undrawn under our $2.75 billion revolving credit facilities.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I guess, Steve, first on the retail figures that you threw out, I'm just curious, where does the re-tenanting
of the JCPenney's box and Manhattan Mall sort of fit into that?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

There's no credit in those guidance number for any new -- for any occupancy in that space yet.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And do you have any updated thoughts on just sort of the timing behind that or sort of any sort of initial
thoughts on what you want to do with that space?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

The answer is we have thoughts. We have a few things that we're working on nothing imminent. And I
think that, that's all I really have to say about that today. Obviously, the rent that JCPenney was paying us
is not realistic in today's market. And I wouldn't expect that space to be leased in the short term.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe, Michael, you talked about good activity you're seeing at kind of both PENN 1 and
PENN 2. Could you just maybe give us without getting too specific, but can you kind of just give us a
flavor for those discussions and what maybe your expectations are in terms of kind of leasing up PENN 2
in particular?

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

Glen, why don't you take that?

Glen J. Weiss
Executive VP of Office Leasing & Co-Head of Real Estate

Sure. Steve, it's Glen. So we are busier every day at both buildings, PENN 1 and PENN 2. PENN 1, we have
multiple lease negotiates happening now. As you know, there's no real big blocks there, but we certainly
are putting full floors together, and the attraction to the redevelopment has been remarkable. The new
lobbies opened now, which has only accelerated the activity. People are getting a great, now physical feel
to how great the asset will be. It feels like a brand-new building.

At PENN 2, we have daily presentations at the Experience Center. We have RFPs in the door on certain
blocks. We are feeling great about it. By the way, we're not rushing on it because we know that it's going
to be better as the construction unfurls. It's early, but we're certainly in the market. We're in deal-making
mode, but we're not rushing.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Steve, I would just add my two cents. I mean, the proof of the pudding is that we're in the market.
Glen and his team is in the market every day with this space, talking to the brokerage community and
to prospective tenants. The reaction has been nothing short of astonishing. We had never seen it in our
careers in terms of the reception as to what's happening, first of all, the whole West Side and second of
all, the unique program that we're putting together.

So we are extremely enthusiastic our strategy, as Glen said, is to let a little time pass until we're not in a
rush because we have a level of -- the most important thing that I said with respect to the PENN is we are
so convicted and we are so enthusiastic, and we are centering to the marketplace that at the very outset,
we are now raising prices. So you can take a lot from that.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Great.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

By the way, you should put on your construction boots and come over and see us.

Operator

The next question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

It's actually Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Steve, you made a comment, I hope you're well, but you
made a comment in your opening remarks about a Fortune 500 company looking at, I think you said
300,000 square feet. It was going to house about 2,800 employees. And then upon further review, they
increased their space needs by 30% for the same number of employees.

I think your firm tends to have a little bit lower or smaller of a lease size in terms of leasing. Obviously,
you have a number of bigger tenants, but an average lease size of smaller than 300. How are those
medium-sized tenants thinking about their space? So how -- how often does the situation come up where
someone's willing that want to take more space? And how are they thinking about the total cost of that to
get to that point?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Glen is probably more qualified to answer than I am, but I'll give you my thoughts. Number one, you
have to remember that real estate cost for these tenants is one of the smallest line items in their P&L. So
there are different management teams, different perspectives, okay? So we went through the WeWork
experience, where the whole economics were driving the space per capita -- the square footage per capita
down from what was 250 square feet per capita before, down to as low as a stupid number like 60 okay?
Well, that doesn't work. So a lot of this has to do with what the management's philosophy is as to how
they're going to treat their employees.

So number one, from a health point of view, that dictates more space per capita. And in terms of real
estate is a recruiting tool, especially in New York. So a lot of that has to do with the management's vision
as to what they want the space to look like and feel like and what kind of experience they want their
employees to have.

So what I'm saying is just to take a [ row ] well, obviously, if 10 people out of 100 are going to work from
home, they need 10% less space, that's not true. And so I think it's all over the lot, but what I'm saying is
there's a feeling in the marketplace and in the analyst community that it's a certainty that COVID -- that
work from home, which was lower square footage requirements by the tenants, that's not true. Some yes,
many no.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Glen, you have additional thoughts?

Glen J. Weiss
Executive VP of Office Leasing & Co-Head of Real Estate

Yes. I mean one thing that we talked about on -- in Michael's remarks is flight to quality. So number
one, a lot of the deal making with new tenants are an upgrade to the better buildings with the better
landlords and the better locations. With that, we're seeing space plans for a review every day in these
buildings. And there's been no dimunition in terms of space, in terms desk sharing, et cetera, and it's
exactly reflective of what Steve said. I mean that's exactly what's going on out there on the ground.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Now just to add to that, one of the things we're seeing from all the space planners with whom we deal
with all of them every day is management teams want more communal space, more hangout space, more
conference space, et cetera. So it's not just the particular cubicle or desk or office where an individual sits,
it's the entire package. And I don't believe, in most cases, that's going down. In fact, in many cases, it
may even go up.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And Steve, how do you think it plays out? Because I would say most of the commentary that you're
talking about is consistent when we talk to the senior management teams of corporations, CEOs, CFOs
when we talk to the real estate landlords. But when you survey the actual employees across the United
States, they tell a different story, right? They want immense flexibility. How can that not at the tails, there
will be exceptions, but the bulk of the curve would suggest that a vast majority of employees have a
different view of how they want to work going forward than how their employers. How does that tension
ultimately get resolved?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Well, Michael, you can bet on the employer -- employees. I'm going to bet on the employers, okay? I think
it gets resolved in different, different ways. Different firms will do different things. But basically, I believe
in the office as the principal driver of commerce. And I believe the office will continue to be the core of
a business where creativity decisions, et cetera, are made. And I think if -- I use the phrase at a kitchen
table, I don't think the kitchen tables are going to beat out the office.

Right now, there's a very strange phenomenon, and that is folks who're out in the [ hampers ] getting full
pay and enjoying it. That's not going to continue from more than another quarter or 2 or 3.

So at some point, the people who pay the paychecks are going to insist that they're their gang, their
team, their thinkers, their creators are back in the office where they can see them, touch and feel them
and interact.

Now there will always be some work from home or work from anywhere or whatever. There always has.
Nobody works a 52-week full 5-day week in the office. Everybody has some whatever time where they're
not in the office. But I believe as this plays out, the employer's desire to have their staff in the office will
carry the day.

Michael Jason Bilerman
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just a second question, just in terms of the spin-off. Can you just give a little bit more
color in terms of where you stand today, when we should expect some filings? And secondarily, whether
you are at least exploring private alternatives, just given the public market still is shunning office stocks.
And so is there an opportunity to use private capital or an alternative nonpublic structure to get to where
you want to be?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

The answer is sure. We explore all alternatives in terms of creating value every day. We are in midstream
with respect to the legal and banking, et cetera, activity to create the what I call is a separate tradable
public security. That's the way I like to look at it because I think our shareholders deserve to have
the ability to invest in either a -- menu A or menu B. With respect to the high probability is that, that
transaction, as contemplated, will be completed. You'll know we're not going to predict when we're going
to file papers at the current time.

If some other kind of transaction surfaces, we will, of course, study that and consider that. As of now,
there are no alternative transactions that we're considering, and we're on full speed ahead for the -- the
separately tradable security. And by the way this is the [ slide ]?

And Michael, I couldn't be more enthusiastic about this idea about the opportunity, okay? We are fully --
we have full conviction about the PENN District. We think what we're doing is something which is going to
be totally unique and one of the most important developments in the real estate industry country wide.
And I think that the strategy is a superb strategy. Thanks.

Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Steve, you mentioned the PENN asking rents are trending higher. Can you provide any color on that as far
as the dollar amounts or percentage? And should we be expecting the development yields?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

John, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

That's okay. You talked about the PENN asking rents increasing. I was wondering if you could provide
some more color on that, either the dollar amount or the percentage increase? And also, if we should
expect development yield to also increase or should that be offset by higher cost or higher TIs?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

With respect to the asking rents, I mean, I think that those are published, aren't they? No -- so they're
not published. So we're not going to get into a conversation with them. But I can tell you that our
conviction is so strong that we are raising our asking prices. which obviously, if construction costs are
stable, will raise yields. I believe that the numbers that we have in our supplement in terms of rents and
yields are the lowest that they could possibly be extremely conservative.

And we expect over time, if we do our job right and we will, and we create the kind of atmosphere that
we have created at the Bloomberg Tower, for example, or 220 Central Park South with superbly conceived
space for our occupiers, the rents will go to a premium to the rest of the market. We're just at the
beginning of this adventure.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Maybe this is a question for Michael, but we're still a few years away from the PENN redevelopment
being stabilized. But can you just remind us of your capitalized interest policy, if there are floors that are

unleased, do you expense those immediately? Or do you capitalize on leased floors until stabilization until
they'll be [ stuffed ].

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

I mean, they're out of service, then we're capitalizing that interest, right? We bring them back service,
then we stop that policy. So obviously, PENN 2 is out of service and that we've laid those numbers out in
the supplement. PENN 1 today is all in service. So I think that's -- I think it's pretty straightforward, John.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Securities, Research Division

Steve, I want to go back to your comments on Big Tech being very active. Can you just maybe quantify or
just help us understand, I mean, we obviously saw a lot of Big Tech leasing over the last few years. Just
how large that pipeline really looks? And where they may be going? And how long you think it might take
to actually see some of these leases come together?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

That's a question for Glen.

Glen J. Weiss
Executive VP of Office Leasing & Co-Head of Real Estate

So as you know, we have all the big tech. We have Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google. We're obviously in
touch with them often, as you would expect. And they're all in mode thinking about expansion in New York
as we sit on this phone call. I'm not going to get into specifics on our discussions or what their plans are,
but I could tell you the engines are on again and they're revved up to start searching for more space and
as their hiring paces continue. So just I would be watching for that action as this year goes on.

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

Jamie, I don't think it's surprising. I mean, I sense surprise in your voice. But I mean if all you have to
do is look at the earnings growth and what's being produced by big tech, by medium tech, fintech. These
companies are growing at significant rates, even despite their size. The law of large numbers sort of is,
historically, it's been difficult to do. So -- and they need people, engineers, sales, et cetera, to continue to
grow their business, whether it's laterally or additionally vertically in what they're doing already.

And so whether it's big tech, medium tech, New York has continued to be a market of choice, for the
reason Steve outlined. But these companies, they probably had a 4-month pause in 2020. They're going
gangbusters right now in terms of the earnings growth, and they need people to continue to drive that
going forward.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

And beyond that, the big tech has a limited capital. I mean, if you look at their balance sheet and their
cash reserves and their stocks, et cetera, they have a limited capital and the cost of their capital is
basically 0, and they have a limited ambition to innovate and grow and invent and they are not shy of
spending and investing.

So obviously, they are favorite clients of ours, and there's a reason for that. They believe in New York.
They love the size of New York, the scale of New York, the ability to open up space and hire 3,000

engineers in 1 year. They can't do that hardly any place else, they love the education and very importantly
and interestingly, they love the diversity of the population.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Securities, Research Division

How should we think about the space they just leased? I guess, do they already feel like it's -- they have
enough heads to fill those seats? Or it's just all about the 10-year view at this point and get what you can
while you can?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I don't know. Look, anecdotally, one of our big tech customers complained recently that in a certain city,
not New York, they're having trouble filling the seats. And they're upset about that. We have not heard
that in New York. New York has a large workforce and they're very happy with it. So if you think about
it, if -- in the last 1.5 years or so, there was about 3 million square feet of big tech lease, something like
that. So if you take a 200 square foot per capita, what is that 4,500 employees. So the numbers are
large. And the beauty of New York is it has the scale to satisfy their aspirations. So the answer is they're
growing, they're hiring, and they're going to continue to do that.

James Colin Feldman
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then secondly, you talked about occupancy bottoming, rents bottoming. I mean can you give us
a sense of where you think the occupancy trajectory goes for New York office?

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

I mean, Jamie, I don't know we want to give you a specific projections, it'll be off by 10, 20 basis points
here or there. But this is clearly the bottom of it. It's just a matter, I mean, again, we talked about
pipeline, it is significant, much higher than it was last quarter, and I'd say significant on an absolute basis.
And it just depends on when Glen and his team finalized the leases, right?

So the number could be 2 points higher, it could be 1 point higher at the end of the year. It just depends
on time. But I think the punchline is we've reached the bottom. We see meaningful improvement based
on what's in the queue. And whether it happens this quarter, next quarter, the following quarter, the trend
line will be up.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I'll give you my opinion as to where this goes. If you look at our occupancy rates over a 20-year period,
we are almost always at 97% or maybe even a pinch higher, okay? Every once in a while, over that 10-
year cycle, we dipped down a little bit. And there's generally reasons for that. In this case, we have a
building and transition at 350 Park Avenue. We have a building in transition and 85 Tenth Avenue. And
in both those instances, we are talking to enough prospects that fill double the amount of space that is
vacant there or more.

So my expectation is we are going to go back to the 97-plus percent occupancy rate that we always carry.
It's just a matter of whether it takes a year or 2 years. That's where we're going.

Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

So two questions. And actually, Steve, you just sort of recasted the question I was going to ask. I was
going to ask you if you still believe in Manhattan tilting to the South and the West, given the resurgence
of Midtown, Grand Central. Obviously, you guys bought One Park. But to Jamie's question, you just talked
about 350 Park enough tenants to double the demand. So I guess, wrapping up because I'd like to ask
about 350, do you see Midtown, the Grand Central market returning as the dominant submarket? Or do
you still believe that New York is still tilting to the South and to the West?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I like the phrase that I invented some years ago, the predictive phrase that New York is tilting. I think
that's still the case. Notwithstanding, New York is a great mysterious, wonderful place, okay? So Park
Avenue South, which is what's what we call that So Midtown South is a smaller, but very highly sought
after submarket. There's not going to be any new construction in there. And it's a very -- it's a great
submarket with lots of culture, lots of texture, and lots of grit. And's it will do just fine.

I think would you characterize 770 Broadway as part of that market?

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

Yes.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

So I think we own the premier building in that submarket 770 Broadway, which is now the home of
Wegmans and of course, Facebook. So now let's go to conventional Midtown. Park Avenue has been a
stepchild for a while. It's gotten older and tighter and that is now changing aggressively. Park Avenue is
going to reclaim its role as the great boulevard of commerce in the world.

So we have JPMorgan Chase tearing down a building and rebuilding it with a stupendous headquarters
building, which we're familiar with because they're using Norman Foster. So we have -- and their
plans have been published. We own the adjacent building to that, 280 Park Avenue, which we're very
enthusiastic about. There are 2 other potential -- there's another brand new Foster building up at 55th
Street. There's 2 more teardowns and rebuilds that are going to happen in Park Avenue.

So Park Avenue is going to become what it always should be and that's a premier boulevard of commerce.
So all of these parts in the city is not going to be segregated into 1 or 2 submarkets, all submarkets are
going to do well. We believe that on a relative basis, the Midtown West market, the PENN District market
will do on a relative basis better than the others and will grow faster than the others and we'll have higher
demand than the others.

And the statistics, as I said, about market share, if you look at how much leasing is done in each district
compared to how large a district is, the PENN District wins that race. But everything in New York is going
to thrive, except for the really c*** buildings, and there are plenty of them.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

And Steve, you still feel confident on your bet on Penn Station winning the race over Grand Central even
after the opening of East Side Access, which East Side Access obviously would be great for 280, great for
350 and your other neighboring buildings, but you still -- you don't think East Side access will eat into
your Penn Station?

15

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

No. I think it's -- I think the -- look, you can look at all kinds of negative issues. Penn Station has always
been the transportation hub of this region for 100 years, okay? All of the networks and all the spiderweb
of transportation from the 380 degrees come into Penn Station, and that's the way it's designed.

Now obviously, there's going to be -- Grand Central, is not nothing, and -- but it will be fine. There will be
plenty of business in Penn Station. I'm not in a relative race with Grand Central. Grand Central is going to
be fine. We think Penn Station is going to be a little [indiscernible] and that's okay with me.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

No, that's fine. And then the question for Michael.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

By the way. Hang on, hang on, Alex.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Sure, sure, Steve.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

There's an enormous amount of public capital that is being invested in Penn now. I'm sure you've seen the
Moynihan improvement, which is, of course, ours all the adjacent real estate to retail, et cetera. And I'm
sure you couldn't be more aware of the Gateway project, which is a massive infrastructure project.

And I'm sure you're also aware of the plans to expand Penn Station's trackage which means capacity to
the South, which is -- I mean these are huge infrastructure projects, which have 10-year projects and
take tens and tens of billions of dollars. And I can tell you that the government's focus is on Penn. So we
believe in Penn. And that doesn't mean that Grand Central isn't going to thrive as well. It will, and we
hope it will.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. The next question is for Michael. On second quarter, you guys handily beat the Street estimates.
And I'm just sort of curious, in that second quarter number, and Steve, you mentioned guidance, I didn't
see guidance, but maybe I just missed it, the lack of coffee. Michael, is there -- what is onetime in the
second quarter?

And what is sort of sustainable stuff? So as we think about that $0.80 number, how much of that is a go-
forward number? And how much of that was just sort of either onetime rent collections or onetime true-
ups or whatever that would not repeat?

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

I think $0.80, obviously, includes the gains from 220. So look at [ comparable ], which is $0.59, which is
up $0.13 from last year. Obviously, that benefited from not having a recurrence of the straight-line write-
offs, principally from [ pennies ] in New York Company. But we had rent commencement at several assets,
which were positive. So as we've said, the run rate which basically [ closed from fourth ] were a little bit
better or bit worse depending overall -- yes, is consistent, Alex.

And so I think it's -- I think that's the right thing to model for the remainder of the year. Obviously, the
trend lines are getting a little better. But as we sit here today, we're not prognosticating doing better
than that yet. But I think the short answer is not withstanding those straight-line write-offs, there were

16

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

enough other positives that picked up on those things. So on a run rate basis, I think that's all a pretty
good number.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then I think there was a piece of paper that went over the mic. You said run rate something
about fourth quarter, but that it was muddled. Did you cite the things?

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

No. My comment was when we started the year, we said the fourth quarter of '20 was a decent run rate
for the entire year of 2021, and we still think that's the case.

Operator

Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe just first on all the leasing activity that you've done over the last, call it, 12 months or so. Can you
give us a rough estimate of the NOI contribution from leases signed but not commenced?

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

We don't have those numbers at our fingertips, Vikram. We'll have to come back on that.

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. No worries. And I wanted to dig into just comments about the [ A/B divide ] the class A or quality
versus more tired building. And Steve, I guess I wanted to get a sense of how you see that divide
playing out in terms of rents and TIs. And specifically for the Vornado portfolio, I'm sure it's a very
small proportion. But if you were to guesstimate sort of what proportion today would you need to spend
incremental CapEx dollars to kind of get them up to speed in that divide?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I think what you're saying is, how -- do we have any B buildings? And if so, how much is going to cost to
fix them?

Vikram Malhotra
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

The answer is we have none. And maybe we have 1 little space here, 1 little space there, but it's so de
minimis, I can't even put a number on. We've been on a program -- we've been on a program that started
with David Greenbaum and Glen, 15 years ago to reposition all of our inventory so that it's first class and
a surrogate for new.

Now when I say reposition, I mean, lobbies, physical appearance, mechanical systems, elevators, tech
service, et cetera. So we don't have any buildings that we're not proud of.

VORNADO REALTY TRUST FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 03, 2021

Okay. Great. And then just, sorry, one clarification on the [ 2023 street ] retail initial number that you
provided. That obviously includes rent bumps, but does it include a specific occupancy for the street retail
portfolio? Or is that just existing portfolio and rents converting to cash?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Where's Tom?

Thomas Sanelli
Executive VP of Finance & Chief Administrative Officer

So it includes leasing up some vacant space that we have today, Vikram, and it also includes the Farley
retail, which would be something that we don't have in-service today.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

But it's a very small amount of the Farley retail. So it's -- if you include the Farley retail, that would mean
it's not really a same-store number because we're adding a new space. The amount of almost the vast
majority of it -- the vast majority of it, the huge majority of it is basically same-store [indiscernible].

Operator

Our next caller is Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.

Joshua Burr
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

This is Josh Burr on with Nick. So I know it's hard to estimate, but based on what you're hearing from
your tenants about returning to the office after Labor Day, what's your expectation for office utilization
after Labor Day? And what would you consider to be a bull case scenario?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I think I said in my remarks that one, I, for one -- I can't answer that question. All of the conference calls
that I have listened to is all of my pals have come up with a number and very strong conviction about this
is going to happen by a certain date, I have no idea. There is no magic date.

But I think I said in my remarks and I'll say it again is that it may take a quarter, it may take 2 quarters,
whatever it is, we believe, from talking to our tenants that normal work headcount, normal work
population and normal theme will return. And I just can't predict nor does it make sense to try to predict
when that will happen exactly. I believe that New York will turn to its robust bustling self somewhere in the
shorter term.

Joshua Burr
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then you mentioned that you're betting on the employers rather than employees when you're
figuring out the return to office. So I'm curious, what do you think about the Department of Justice ruling
that businesses can mandate vaccinations for their employees? And how do you think that impacts the
return to office?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I think that's a very complicated question, which goes to both law and ethics. And I think each company
is going to have to -- I mean, basically, the extension of that is if you're not vaccinated, you're fired. Now
that's a very interesting situation. I don't -- I really don't want to get into what our policy will be with
respect to our important employees whom we cherish or what the market is going to do. I don't think
that's a question for me.

We have a question from Daniel Ismail from Green Street.

Daniel Ismail
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Just going back to rent, you mentioned raising rents at PENN District a couple of times. I'm just curious,
on a net effective basis, are those rents back to pre-COVID levels? Or is there still some discounts?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

In the PENN District, we're coming off $50 and $60 rents. So and I think our guidance in our supplement
is somewhere in the $90 number with -- so obviously, we are budgeting in PENN 1 and PENN 2, which is
the better part of 4.5 million fee, that there's going to be a $30 a foot uptick. And that's what justifies the
expenditure -- the capital expenditure and also that creates the nucleus of our district.

We believe that we will achieve those budgeted numbers and more so. So I think that's your answer is
we're not pre-COVID numbers. We're actually -- it's not relevant because the pre-COVID number is the old
building, we're talking about the new buildings.

Michael J. Franco
President & CFO

I would just add to Steve's comment, Dan, and I think where you're going to is our expectations for PENN,
if you look at our aspirations, pre-COVID, right, they are equal or higher than where they were, right? And
I think the comments on raising rents reflect the market's reception to those. And so we are more bullish
today than we were if you go back Pre-COVID.

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. Let's talk about it a little bit. Our strategy is that we have a unique, huge 6, 8, 10 block collection
of assets and property that surrounds the most important transit hub in the city actually in the country.
Our strategy is that we know from the -- we're developers. We're not just owners with developers. Our
strategy in creating assets and redeveloping our assets is that quality is something that the market is
willing to pay for and appreciates. So if you look at 2 very prominent examples of what we have done as
a business, the Bloomberg building, which we did -- which I did some years ago is extraordinary. It's 15
years into it, and it still is cutting age in terms of the user experience in that building.

By the way, a lot of that has to do with Mike himself who as a very -- the interior designs are
extraordinary. Go to 220 Central Block South where we have achieved something that nobody ever
thought could possibly be achieved based upon the quality of the offering that we have given.

If you go into the 2 PENN lobby, which just opened 2 weeks ago -- I'm sorry, the 1 PENN lobby, and
it's only half opened, whatever you could begin to see what the environment that we're creating, which
we think is unique, and we know because of brokers, tourers and occupier stores already that the
marketplace respects understands what we have done. So we think that, that has an enormous effect our
ability to develop, our vision to develop on the value of the assets that we are creating. There's more.

We also believe in multiple buildings and clusters of buildings so that we can offer the tenant a uniqueness
that you can't get by going into a single building. I've said this before, and I'd like to say it again. A
300,000-foot tenant and a 600,000-foot building is dead, if that tenant wants another 100,000 square
feet, he's going to have to move out or move 5 blocks away. In our complex, which will eventually grow
to 10 million, 12 million, maybe even 15 million feet, that 300,000 square foot tenant, Glen will always be
able to provide that tenant with what he needs in our complex. So the cluster of buildings interconnected
above ground and below ground is what creates the district, creates the uniqueness and we believe will
command a premium in the marketplace.

Daniel Ismail
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Appreciate all the color, Steve. And just maybe taking a step back, bigger picture for New York, you
mentioned a few times the difference between higher-quality and lower-quality office building and
mentioned New York has a fair share of older Class B properties. What do you think happens to those
office buildings? Do they get redeveloped? And do they stay office buildings? What is the long-term view
for those properties?

Steven Roth
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I think the first part of that answer is it depends entirely upon the owner. So if the owner is a single owner
or whatever, without the resources of the organization, the vision and the capital, the building is going to
stay a c*** building, and it will find its own market at much lower rents. And of course, that owner may or
may not be able to provide TIs and may or may not be able to keep the building in good repair. So a lot of
it depends upon the order and there's that.

If the owner is a sophisticated firm and a large owner of multiple buildings, eventually, over time, the
buildings will be teared down and there'll be new buildings or whatever or they will take the buildings and
make them so that they are fit to be leased at decent rents below the Class A umbrella.

So if you get a halfway decent building with a sophisticated capable owner with an organization and a
capital base, there will always be a low discount rent market for those buildings. So that's a complicated
thing, I don't know. But great locations and the great pieces of land underneath those B and C buildings
will over time -- and I'm talking about 20 years be bought up by developers and will be teardowns. There
will not be a huge number of those. There'll be 1 or 2 of those every couple of years.
