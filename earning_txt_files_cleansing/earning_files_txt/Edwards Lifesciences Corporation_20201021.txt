Presentation

Operator

Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences Third Quarter 2020 Results
Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.

I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, President of Investor Relations. Thank
you. You may begin.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Diego. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike
Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the
close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released third quarter 2020 financial results.

During today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying
financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A.

Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates,
assumptions and projections. These statements include, but are not limited to, financial guidance
and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation,
reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations.

These statements speak only as of the date on which they were made, and Edwards does not undertake
any obligation to update them after today. Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties,
including, but not limited to, those associated with COVID-19 pandemic that could cause actual results to
differ materially. Information concerning factors that could cause these differences and important product
safety information may be found in the press release, our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards'
other SEC filings, all of which are available on the company's website at edwards.com.

Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring
to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between
GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Mark. Let me begin by saying I am very proud of our passionate team and the way that they
continue to serve patients during this difficult period. Our supply chain has delivered, and our field team
has continued to support the dedicated clinicians that count on Edwards.

We're pleased to report better-than-expected third quarter results despite the challenges of the ongoing
COVID pandemic. Sales of $1.1 billion increased 4%, reflecting growth around the world. Global TAVR
sales headlined our growth with continued adoption of our SAPIEN valve platform and a step-up in
procedure volumes as newly diagnosed patients entered the system and were treated.

In the third quarter, we are also pleased to report growing investments in new therapies and compelling
clinical data announced that the recent TCT Connect conference that we will be having a meaningful
impact on future patient care.

In TAVR, third quarter global sales were $745 million, up 6%. Growth was led by therapy adoption
across all geographies with notable strength in Europe. Globally, our average selling price remains stable.
Although third quarter treatment rates were lifted somewhat by the postponement of treatment in the
second quarter, particularly in Europe, we believe that going forward, there is no significant backlog of
patients in the system.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

Taking a step back, we know that a sad consequence of the intense focus on the pandemic has been that
many patients like those with structural heart disease are delaying screening and treatment or not being
treated at all. Evidence continues to suggest that delaying valve replacement for patients with aortic
stenosis inevitably results in adverse events and increased mortality.

A recent Swiss study AS defer demonstrated that nearly 20% of patients who delayed a previous
scheduled aortic valve replacement reported to the hospital with valve-related symptoms or worsening
heart failure. And closer to home, a study conducted last month by the structural heart program of Mount
Sinai Hospital reported that 10% of patients waiting for aortic valve replacement required urgent TAVR or
passed away during the first month after elective procedures were halted due to COVID.

After 3 months, 35% of patients affected by the ban on elective procedures required an urgent
intervention or passed away. There's growing recognition that postponing treatment of AS has significant
consequences. At the same time, however, we know that this remains a very difficult time for the patients
we serve as they continue to weigh the risk of COVID against the severe effects of progressive heart valve
disease. Our observations indicate that most hospitals globally have determined that they can safely treat
their AS patients in need and at the same time, care for COVID patients.

In conclusion, strong evidence indicates that TAVR is a proven therapy with excellent outcomes. It offers
efficient use of hospital resources and can benefit many more patients whose structural heart disease is
deadly and undertreated today.

Now turning back to the third quarter TAVR results by region. In the U.S., our TAVR sales increased in
the mid-single-digit range versus last year, despite approximately 30% growth in the year ago period.
We were very encouraged by the improvement in procedure volumes in Q3, with 100% of our active sites
across all 50 states performing TAVR cases, up from approximately 90% in Q2.

Third quarter growth across the more than 750 centers in the U.S. was highest in smaller centers, which
are providing access to a broader population of aortic stenosis patients. 2/3 of our U.S. TAVR centers
have completed training and proctoring with SAPIEN 3 Ultra and physician feedback on ease of use and
improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding.

Outside of the U.S., in the third quarter, our underlying TAVR sales increased in the high single-digit range
year-over-year. We continue to be encouraged by the strong international adoption of TAVR, particularly in
Europe, where growth continues to be faster than expected. Edwards' underlying TAVR growth in Europe
versus the prior year was in the high single-digit range. We saw unit increases in nearly every country
across Europe. Growth was driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform. And
although transcatheter valves have been commercially available for over a decade in Europe, AS continues
to be significantly undertreated.

Outside of the U.S. and Europe, we're continuing to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3. Sales
growth in Japan and other regions was strong as aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated
disease, and we remain focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy.

In China, where Edwards recently received regulatory approval to begin treating high-risk patients
suffering from severe aortic stenosis, we successfully completed our first cases in the third quarter. And
although it will likely take significant time to expand our TAVR presence in China, we look forward to
partnering with hospitals across the country to introduce this therapy through our comprehensive, proven
training program.

In summary, we anticipate regional variability due to the pandemic. Yet based on our year-to-date
performance, we continue to anticipate global TAVR sales growth for 2020 will be at the high end of our
previous range of minus 5% to plus 5%.

We anticipate a return to double-digit growth in 2021, and we expect quarterly growth rates to be -- will
be lower year-over-year in Q1 and Q4 with more normal market dynamics versus higher growth in Q2 and
Q3 when the COVID impact was most severe. Global TAVR growth reinforces our belief in our projection of
a $7 billion-plus opportunity by 2024.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

Turning to Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies, or TMTT, we continue to view this opportunity as
one with substantial unmet patient needs and the potential to drive significant growth. Our focus will be
on the advancement of 3 key value drivers, which we believe are the leading indicators of our success:
a portfolio of differentiated therapies, favorable real-world clinical outcomes and favorable results from
rigorous pivotal trials, which will ultimately support approvals and adoption.

As an example of our differentiated therapies, we recently received the CE Mark and began introducing
PASCAL ACE implant system for mitral and tricuspid repair. PASCAL ACE has the differentiated features
of PASCAL with a narrower profile. It is designed to complement PASCAL and provide further options to
optimize treatment for patients with mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

In mitral valve replacement, we continue to advance both transfemoral EVOQUE and SAPIEN M3
platforms, and we remain on track to initiate the U.S. pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 before the end of
the year. In addition, with EVOQUE tricuspid, we are encouraged by the experience gained in our early
feasibility study and are on track to initiate our pivotal trial by year-end.

We are pleased to demonstrate clinical success in these programs as reported at the recent TCT Connect
conference. We presented roll-in data from our Class 2D pivotal study. In U.S. centers, with no prior
experience, the PASCAL system showed favorable 30-day outcomes in patients with degenerative mitral
valves, including low complication rates, significant regurgitation reduction and improvements in quality of
life.

Our 1-year CE Mark class data for PASCAL mitral repair demonstrated robust and sustained MR reduction.
In addition, PASCAL tricuspid repair demonstrated positive 30-day results and Cardioband tricuspid follow-
up demonstrated favorable 2-year results.

And importantly, we're making progress on 5 TMTT pivotal studies. While initial pivotal clinical trial results
could be delayed by a couple of quarters, we are now enrolling patients at pre-COVID rates and looking
forward to generating a body of clinical evidence across our portfolio, demonstrating excellent outcomes
for each one of our therapies.

Third quarter global sales were $12 million. Although the situation remained fluid, we are able to resume
activation of new centers in Europe and increase commercial procedures. We continue to advance our
commercialization of PASCAL in Europe and remain focused on physician training, procedural success and
patient outcomes.

In summary, we expect procedures and activation of centers to continue to be subject to COVID
interruptions in Europe. We anticipate TMTT sales of around $40 million in 2020 versus our previous
estimate of $30 million to $45 million. In addition, while still early in the 2021 forecasting process, our
aspiration is to double 2020 TMTT sales in 2021.

We continue to believe the TMTT opportunity remains significant and now expect a $3 billion global market
by 2025. We reiterate our confidence in this long-term opportunity and are passionate about bringing a
portfolio of solutions to the many patients in need.

In Surgical Structural Heart, sales for the third quarter of $203 million were similar to the 2019 levels,
decreasing 1% on an underlying basis. During the third quarter, we observed that patients were more
willing to seek heart valve surgery and hospitals were able to manage surgical patient flow. Ongoing
prioritization of heart surgery in many hospitals also contributed to rebounding case volumes.

We remain very encouraged by the steady adoption of Edwards' premium RESILIA tissue valves, including
the INSPIRIS aortic surgical valve and the recently launched KONECT aortic valve conduit in the U.S.
In the third quarter, INSPIRIS valve utilization grew in all regions, driven by increased demand among
younger and more active patients.

INSPIRIS is becoming the surgical valve standard of care in many geographies around the world. We
continue to add new INSPIRIS centers in both the U.S. and Europe, and adoption is growing in our existing
centers.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

Following the first commercial cases of HARPOON in Q2 in Europe, we continue to focus on intensive
physician training and robust data collection for this new beating heart mitral valve repair system. We're
seeing positive initial patient results with faster surgery and recovery times with this minimally invasive
therapy.

In summary, we continue to expect surgical structural heart sales for full year 2020 will decline in the
5% to 15% range from 2019. Localized COVID-19 hotspots may continue to be headwinds to procedure
growth. However, our expectation remains that in Q4, our sales will return to positive growth driven by the
market adoption of our newest technologies.

We're excited about our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and
extend our global leadership in premium surgical structural heart technologies.

In Critical Care, sales for the quarter were $181 million, in line with the year ago period. Demand for
our products used in cardiac surgeries was solid, but was offset by the COVID-driven impact of delayed
elective procedures. Sales of our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU were
lifted by a large onetime order in Europe associated with ICU capacity expansion.

However, we continue to experience a decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S. as hospitals continue to
limit their capital spending as a result of COVID.

In summary, we continue to anticipate that Critical Care sales will be negative for 2020, largely due to
anticipated reduced capital spending in the U.S., which is still within our original guidance range of minus
5% to plus 5%.

And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Thanks a lot, Mike. Today, I'll provide additional perspective on the third quarter, along with how we
anticipate the rest of the year may unfold. Our 4% underlying sales growth in the third quarter was better
than we expected as we performed well across all our product lines and geographies, especially Europe.
Earnings were also stronger than we expected, driven primarily by the top line performance combined with
our constrained spending.

As I have previously mentioned, we have implemented cost control measures during COVID, but we
intentionally did not take any actions to significantly impact our employees or reduce investments
supporting our long-term strategy. This allowed us to deliver a strong operating profit margin and adjusted
earnings per share in the third quarter of $0.51, a 9% increase over 2019. GAAP earnings per share was
$0.01 higher at $0.52.

For the third quarter, our adjusted gross margin was 75.5%, down from 75.9% in the prior year quarter.
This decrease was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental costs associated
with responding to COVID, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $307 million or 26.9% of
sales compared to $306 million in the prior year. This consistent level of spending included increased
transcatheter structural heart field personnel-related expenses, including expanding the TMTT field
organization in Europe offset by reduced spending resulting from COVID. As I mentioned earlier, we did
not initiate any actions to significantly impact our employees nor to reduce investment plans supporting
our long-term strategy.

Research and development expenses in the third quarter were $196 million or 17.1% of sales compared
to $195 million in the prior year. This consistent level of spending included increased investments in
transcatheter mitral valve replacement clinical trials, partially offset by lower TAVR clinical trial costs and
reduced spending resulting from COVID.

Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.7% or 11.2%, excluding the impact of
special items. This rate included a 450 basis point benefit from the accounting for employee stock-based

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

compensation, which was 130 basis points or $0.01 favorable to our expectations. We continue to expect
our full year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items to be between 11% and 15%.

Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter sales growth by 60 basis points or $7 million compared to
the prior year. At current rates, we now expect FX to have a neutral impact to full year 2020 sales versus
2019. Our previous guidance estimated a negative $30 million impact. FX rates negatively impacted our
third quarter gross profit margin by 140 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our July
guidance, FX rates lifted our earnings by -- our earnings per share by $0.01.

Turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and
investments at the end of the quarter. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit up to $1 billion. Our
public bonds of approximately $600 million don't mature until 2028. Average shares outstanding during
the third quarter were 631 million, and we expect average shares outstanding for the full year to remain
at this level. Recall that in June, we increased the number of shares outstanding by executing a 3-for-1
stock split.

Free cash flow for the third quarter was $113 million. Defined as cash flow from operating activities of
$216 million, less capital spending of $103 million, our year-to-date free cash flow was $361 million. Free
cash flow was negatively impacted by a $100 million payment related to the settlement of the intellectual
property matter last quarter.

Now I'll finish up with our 2020 guidance for the remainder of the year. Our guidance assumes that the
worst of the '20 -- of the COVID financial impact to Edwards is behind us, although we anticipate regional
hotspots and risks for the foreseeable future given that we anticipate we will achieve fourth quarter year-
over-year underlying sales growth similar to the third quarter.

Within our product groups, we now expect TMTT sales of around $40 million. We continue to estimate
TAVR growth to be at the high end of our previous range of minus 5% to plus 5%; Critical Care growth to
be negative for 2020, but still within our previous guidance range of minus 5% to plus 5%; and Surgical
growth still within our previous guidance range of minus 5% to minus 15% versus 2019.

We are raising the bottom end of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to be now
between $1.85 and $1.95. And for the fourth quarter, we estimate adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to
$0.60.

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mike.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Scott. I want to conclude by saying that Edwards is a dedicated member of the critical health
care infrastructure and I admire the agility, resourcefulness and passion of our employees and partners in
maintaining their important work on behalf of patients.

Putting patients first has never been more important than it is today. As we stand together with the global
community, I'm gratified for our extraordinary team and partners, and I'm optimistic about the future of
delivering innovations to even more patients around the world.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I'm pleased to announce that our 2020 Investor
Conference will be held on Thursday, December 10. We anticipate a great event in a new virtual format
that I hope you'll really like. As usual, this event will include updates on our latest technologies, views on
longer-term market potential and our outlook for the year ahead. More information will be available in the
upcoming weeks on our website.
With that, we're ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Diego?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just a couple of questions for me. So heading in to Analyst Day here, I know raising guidance probably
makes limited sense. But I did want to parse out sort of the fourth quarter guidance and just that'd
be very crystal clear on what it means. Do we take the fourth quarter TAVR commentary to mean no
improvement sequentially in TAVR? Or is it more we see some improvement at a lower rate, but we're just
adjusting that for potential risk of resurgence flu, what have you?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, David. So it's a little bit of all that. We grew 4% in the third quarter, and we said that we
thought the fourth quarter growth would be similar to that, which we think is pretty remarkable in an
environment like this. And a real testament to our team and the supply chain. There are 3 factors that we
considered when we set our Q4 sales guidance, one of them related to what we did last year. You'll have
to remember, as a total company, we grew 20% and 30% TAVR growth in Q4 of '19. Even more in the U.S.
So by comparison, it's quite a difference. As a matter of fact, so the absolute sales number in Q4 is going
to be certainly higher than the sales number in Q3.

There is an issue, I think, associated with our thinking related to the persistence of COVID-19 in the U.S.
and Europe. We think it's probably prudent at this stage just to be thoughtful because of the uncertainty
associated with that. And then the one other factor that I'll mention is we don't believe that there's much
of a significant backlog in Europe any longer, which probably gave us a somewhat of a lift, a little bit of a
lift in Q3 and not be repeated in Q4.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. But you are seeing improvement in September, Mike, and you're seeing some improvement into
October in that underlying TAVR business in the U.S.?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

So we're not going to get into specific months, David, but you just have to remember the steep curve that
we were growing at. So when we -- even if the growth rate were to remain constant, think of how many
additional patients are being treated each month.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, So just a sequential comp issue. Totally understand. And then just maybe one clinical for me, and I'll
jump back in queue. Just the Medtronic head-to-head study they announced, Mike. Just kind of curious,
if you think that population they describe represents 40% of the available patients. And frankly, some
clinicians feel that trial may actually favor S3 in nonhemodynamic endpoints. Just kind of curious on what
the patient population hit that targets and your thoughts on their strategy here and impacts to the market
in general?

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

Yes. Thanks. I think it's a testament to the fact that TAVR is certainly a competitive field, right? Our whole
industry is competitive and certainly, TAVR is that. When we reflect on it, we put more of our focus on
bringing new patients into the system. And we just think this disease is so undertreated. It's a deadly
disease. It's what's most important to us. If you look at why Edwards has grown in the past or why
we're going to grow in the future, that's the biggest factor. I think you know that we're extremely happy
with SAPIEN 3 and the Ultra platform and there's just a large body of high-quality clinical evidence that
supports those.

So to have a head-to-head study on one factor, it might be, but we believe that clinicians make decisions
based on the total patient outcomes and not one singular element.

Operator

Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just 2 quick things. One is a timing -- time line question. The second is a TAVR follow-up. On the time line
side, Mike, I was wondering if you could just comment on any update on the readout on the asymptomatic
trial. And then also on time lines for U.S. PASCAL approval. I assume those are unchanged, but just
wanted to check.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Bob. Yes, COVID-19 did impact the pace of enrollment, much in line with other trials. We've
been encouraged by the pickup of enrollment in Q3 compared to Q2. But we're not really providing an
update at this time. But we'll have more to talk about at the investor conference. And so we ask you to
stay tuned for that.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then on the TAVR follow-up side, just curious if you're able to quantify how much rescheduled
procedures might have helped Q3. And I was also wondering if you could just comment on the COVID
flare-up that's going on right now. Is that something that is slowing TAVR currently? Or are you just
sort of taking that into consideration -- you're taking that possibility into consideration as you give Q4
guidance?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. In the beginning part of that question, Bob, that you wanted me to get a little deeper on was about
the backlog question and how much was there?

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. In Q3, do you have a -- you may not have a factor, but just I think...

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, so we didn't -- so we saw -- we feel like we saw a different story in the U.S. and Europe. And so
U.S. is the biggest part of our business. We don't think there was much clearing of the backlog in Q3. We
think that there just wasn't much carryover. U.S. hospitals tend not to run with big backlogs. In Europe,
by contrast, there occasionally can be those depending on the country, and we did indeed work those
down. We feel like at this point in time, there aren't backlogs that are going to significantly impact our Q4
performance. So I don't know if that's clear. We have pretty much, in the U.S., all our hospitals performing

10

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

cases which means that you also have all hospitals that are screening patients. And so we're into a little
bit more of a normal cadence at this point.

In terms of the COVID question, I think it's a general concern. We're not trying to signal something that's
an inflection point that we see. Just a general concern. With the numbers that we're watching in the U.S.
and Europe, we think it's prudent for us to be careful because of the uncertainty.

Operator

Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.

Joanne Karen Wuensch
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

I have 2. The first one is, can you walk us through the bridge to doubling TMTT revenues in 2021? How
much is that coming from PASCAL? And your level of confidence of reaching that at this stage? And then
my second question is, is geographic reach outside of the 3 core markets, I think, has been next focused
on China. Where are we on that launch and expansion?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Joanne. As you can imagine, we're kind of early in our planning process for 2021. So we're
kind of going out there a bit and extending ourselves when we talk about our aspiration to double. So we'll
probably have more to talk about that to get in-depth when we're together at the investor conference. But
much like this year, the majority of those sales are likely to be PASCAL. We're not necessarily -- it's going
to be the addition of new sites that are going to help do that, and we'll have PASCAL and PASCAL ACE
that will help us. And we'll be doing treatment of not only MR patients, but TR patients next year, meaning
tricuspid. So that combination is what's leading us to have this aspiration to double.

Your question about China. We're really pleased that we completed our first cases. We think it's going to
take significant time. Even though we're really excited about this, it was a major milestone for Chinese
patients. The first time a multinational company is in there. There's just a lot of hurdles for a couple
of reasons. Some are self-imposed. We are committed to make sure that we really carefully work with
physicians so that they get well-trained on our systems and get great results every time. There's also
a fair amount of -- I don't know, maybe bureaucracy is not the right term, but there's a lot of process
related to really coming up in China. So it's going to take us some time. And frankly, it's a new journey for
us to bring a therapy that's just novel to China. So we don't have a lot of experience with that.

Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.

Rajbir Singh Denhoy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I hate to come back to this point, but the guidance for TAVR for the year, I know you're talking about sort
of 5% at the upper end of the previous range. That sort of implies that the fourth quarter is going to be
relatively flat, I guess, to the kind of 6% in this quarter. And I appreciate the commentary around Europe
and maybe not seeing a bolus there. But I guess I'm just curious whether there is anything more to that,
right? Is that really kind of pullback from what you're seen? Or is it really just kind of a flattening of the
recovery here into the back half of the year or the last quarter of the year?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Maybe I'm looking at this much different than you, Raj. I'm really excited about what's going on
with our business and the fact that we're going to be able to maintain this kind of growth rate. And when
you consider that last year, TAVR grew 30% globally. As a matter of fact, I think it was 40% in the U.S.
and that we're going to put a growth rate on top of it. While the global pandemic is going on, I mean

I feel pretty proud of that. And I don't know that it gets a lot better than that. So to think that there's
something that we feel uncomfortable about is probably reading the signal is wrong, and maybe I didn't
state it the way I really feel about it.

Rajbir Singh Denhoy
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

No, that's crystal clear. Yes, definitely glass half full not half empty. So it's crystal clear. And maybe just on
PASCAL, right, so a decent -- a good quarter, actually, in terms of where you ended up there. Is that any
indication of what's happening on the ground in Europe? Is your strategy of pricing at a premium starting
to yield some results for you there?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So we were pleased with our results in PASCAL in the quarter. And again, a very fluid situation and
having to ramping this up during the pandemic is a little bit challenging. But we're really pleased with
the way it's come up. It's because we added new centers in the quarter, we continue to implement what
we call our high-touch model. So we're very engaged with clinicians involved in every case and working
hard to make sure that they get great results each time. So that's really turned out to be what's most
important for us, the pricing as much as the same as we've talked about in the past. We do have a
premium. We think this is a really good therapy and it performs at a superior level. Obviously, we need to
back that up with data. But our strategy is unchanged.

Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And I'm sure you'll get into this more at the Analyst Day, but I have to ask the double-digit growth next
year. It's easy comps this year. And I would imagine everybody expected double-digit growth. How should
we put this in perspective? Is this maybe double-digit growth CAGR off of 2019 numbers? Any way you
can help frame it because I'm sure there's a wide variance around what people interpret that to mean?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

No, you're so right, Robbie. I mean everybody should have some pretty terrific growth. I imagine if you're
in airline, you could really have impressive growth rates coming off a low base. But one of the things that
I think is remarkable about Edwards is we just didn't take as big a dip as many other companies. So to
return double-digit growth, I think still is meaningful. If there is something that I can add for color, it's
what I tried to relate related to the quarters. And so we would expect in quarters like 1 and 4 that are a
little bit more comparable to a steady state, we will be likely to see the lower growth rates and then see
much higher growth rates, which should be unusual ones probably for Q2 and Q3, when COVID was hitting
the hardest. But hopefully, that ends up providing some color. But your point is well taken.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

That's really helpful. Appreciate it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up here. One of your competitors,
smaller in the TAVR space recently talked about at TCT, some fatigue and structural heart trial recruiting.
It sounds like you're more back to normal. Should we expect trials to continue at pre-COVID levels here
given that doctors are still catching up on patients to a degree? Or should we expect that it was a 6-month
delay for most trials and the clock can restart here?

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 21, 2020

Yes. It's a good question, Robbie. As you might imagine, making predictions on something like this is
challenging. We kind of stick our neck out here a little bit. When we're talking about our TMTT trials,
we said we think it did go back to pre-COVID levels. In TAVR, where we have some pretty aggressive
enrollment, it's probably getting closer. It might be a little short of it, but it's moving along pretty well, and
we're hoping that the situation continues to be stable and roll that way.

Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Crédit Suisse.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I have just one on -- a follow-up on sort of the TAVR environment and one on maybe sort of pipeline for
patients and the process for getting more of these patients in the centers. The first, just -- you mentioned,
I think, Mike, in your prepared remarks that smaller centers grew faster in the U.S. here in the third
quarter. I'm just wondering, is that off of more of a constrained performance in Q2? Or you find that
they're sort of leading or lagging? Is there any kind of pattern in larger small centers or regionally that you
can talk about? Just color on how all these centers are coming back? And then I have one follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Matt. And very fair question. We've given different guidance in the past for other quarters.
We're more or less just trying to tell you what we saw, which is that the smaller centers seem to grow
faster. In terms of being explained the why behind that, we'd be speculating to some extent. We can make
up stories that maybe the larger centers are in big metropolitan areas that were harder hit by COVID,
but we really don't have hard evidence to back that up, Matt. But we just did see it in the smaller centers
more than the larger.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's great. And then the follow-up just on the challenges around ramping up patients coming into the
centers and being diagnosed. I've seen some of the data you presented on, the number of echoes taking a
dip in the toughest part of the Pandemic and I'm assuming recovering coming out of that. Is it sort of -- as
you look at our centers look at trying to get their pace of patients up and going again for the reasons you
described and the risks of patients and so on, is it echo is part of the process? Is it just getting patients
into see their cardiologists? Where do you think maybe the biggest challenges are or the biggest, the
greatest progress that's been made in turning that around?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Yes, thanks, Matt. I mean I don't want to miss the really big issue, which is that by and large, our
conversation with hospitals, they have -- really strongly believe that they now know how to do TAVR cases
or to treat structural heart patients and COVID patients at the same time. When this first hit in Q2, that
was a question mark. And I think that for all the right reasons for patients and for the health of hospitals,
they figured it out. So that's been important. It's hard to speak in generalities around the whole world. But
if we just take U.S., which is the biggest market, when the hospital sort of closed its doors and prepared
for COVID, not only did they stop doing procedures, they stop doing screening. And so when this got
turned back on, they turned on both the screening process and the actual procedures at the same way.

Now I don't know that they have actually additional screening capacity beyond what they've had in the
past. So that probably becomes somewhat of the constraint, but there probably were some patients that
were either lost sadly just because they passed away or just not in the system today that would have been
otherwise in a more normal year.

Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Just a question on PASCAL in Europe. And I'm curious, Mike, if you could give a little bit of color on how
centers are adopting PASCAL. You know we saw with TAVR. A lot of these centers carry more than one
device on the market. Are you -- or on their shelves. I'm sorry, are you seeing the same with the mitral
repair product? Or they are switching essentially to PASCAL from MitraClip?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It's a good question. And I know I probably -- I'll be generalizing to some extent. So that's already
dangerous. But I wouldn't say that we see people completely switch from one system to another. I think
that we see them more or less split. Again, they're very interested in PASCAL. They invite us in. In many
cases, they're learning. We're part of the procedures that help them work through it. As we think about it
and maybe just give you something else to think about. I know we're hyper-focused on how much we sell
of PASCAL in the quarter. But if you really look for leading indicators of what's going to be most important
for TMTT, I think there's 3 factors. How is this portfolio of differentiated therapies really developing? Are
they coming along? Are those good procedures? Are they learnable, teachable? Are they fast procedure?
Are they reproducible? How about your real-world clinical outcomes? Well, you saw some of the leading
indicators of that at TCT Connect. And I think it's encouraging.

And then just how are we doing on the clinical trials. We've got some very rigorous clinical trials that are
going to provide really incredible data. And so those are going to be the things that both lead to approvals
and adoption. So although the sales are an interesting one to track. I don't know that it's a strong, a
leading indicator of some of these other factors. We frankly, put more energy to make sure we get great
results than just try and maximize sales.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then if I could ask one more question and that's on the head-to-head trials that
Medtronic is running or trials, the SMART trial. And just this whole dynamic of the hemodynamic gradient.
And I'm curious if you guys have had to counter detail that at all in the field? Or if this is more noise from
Medtronics and something that actual physicians care about?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Sure. I know our folks probably answer questions about that on a regular basis. What we know is, we're
just really pleased with the SAPIEN 3 and especially the SAPIEN 3 Ultra performance. We think people
have relied on it, not just normally, but even during this pandemic. I think the performance speaks for
itself. We've got some pretty impressive data that's been generated over time, whether it's death, stroke,
paravalvular leak, low pacemaker rate, the list goes on. And so we just have a high level of confidence in
this and don't -- we wonder whether that -- how important that factor is going to be in the long-term to
look at one thing.

Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Maybe to start just on PASCAL ACE. I was hoping to get some additional detail there. I think you
mentioned that it has a narrow profile. So how should we think about the clinical impact? Is it improve
safety or efficacy? Is it for different anatomy? Just any color you could provide there would be great. And
then I had a follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes, thanks for that, Adam. So first of all, think of it as having almost the same differentiated features
as PASCAL. So it's got the independent panels. It's got a spacer, it's all those things like PASCAL, but
with a narrower profile. It's a [ night and all ] based system. The question you ask about, okay, how
is it going to manifest itself clinically? We're expecting it to be a complement that as physicians gain
experience, they'll say, "Oh, maybe this is a good case to use a PASCAL ACE. Frankly, we're still early in
our experience. And those are some of the answers that we're going to get as we get deeper experience.
At this point, we're still -- it's still new enough that we can't say definitively where that's going to fit on a
long-term basis.

Adam Carl Maeder
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then for the follow-up, maybe switching to TAVR. Just curious if you had a sense for the
number of U.S. TAVR sites that were added in Q3, what are the expectations going forward? Do you think
we're in an environment now where we can see new sites start to come back online at a healthy clip?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks. I'm trying to think of the data. I know that we talked about the fact that there were about
750. The last time we reported in, I don't remember what the number is. And so I'll have to go back and
check on that. Just to give you a little bit of color, though, we're probably anticipating in the U.S. that this
maxes out maybe in the 850 range. So I don't know if that helps you think about it. The rate that they're
actually joining, I don't know off the top of my head.

Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So I just wanted to follow-up on that center question for next year. When you're thinking about the
double-digit growth, do you need to add a lot of centers to do that? Can you talk about your assumptions
for center adds? And how much of that growth comes from existing versus new centers?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Yes, thanks for that. Well, you could imagine, most of our growth is going to come from existing
centers. New centers, by their nature, are smaller. I don't know the specific number that's in there. Maybe
that's a good question to ask at the investor conference. But that's not going to be the bulk of our growth.
The bulk of our growth is going to come from growth in existing centers. Remember, we're at 750 already.
So to drive these kind of big numbers, you can just -- you can anticipate that.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And just to follow, everybody's kind of dancing around this question. But I mean, the consensus is
modeled around 19% or 20% growth on the old number, and you're talking about double-digit growth.
Can you comment at all about consensus and whether you think that's aggressive, realistic? Is there a
scenario that you can do that number?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Maybe not as intimately familiar with the consensus as you are. But I'll just remind you that, would
you say, 19% is probably driven off a much lower base than Edwards is actually delivering in 2020. So

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

2 on the pipeline. One on Catalyst in 2021. What are the most important ones, Mike? I'm not interested in
laundry. I'm not just asking for a laundry list, but what do you think the most important ones are? And I'm
specifically interested to know if we could see the CLASP 2D data next year and EVOQUE for tricuspid CE
Mark approval? And I have one follow-up.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I don't think that we're going to see pivotal trial results in 2021. I think those are more likely to come
in 2022. I do expect there to be a steady drumbeat of new data, almost on a continuous basis. We have so
many innovations going on, Larry that I think at every meeting, you're going to see follow-ups on CE Mark
studies. You're going to see first experiences. You're going to see a lot of things that are really powerful,
leading indicators. But in terms of a pivotal trial, I don't think that we have 1 in 21.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And Mike, on the tricuspid market, there does seem to be a lot of enthusiasm for transcatheter tricuspid
therapies. And I guess my question for you is do you think we're going to need randomized controlled data
to kind of drive that market outside the U.S.? Or do you think it could develop like we saw TAVR develop
before you came out with the PARTNER trial, the -- you had pretty strong uptake for SAPIEN in Europe
before the randomized controlled data. So what do you think -- what's your view on the tricuspid market?
What it's going to take to drive that?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Larry, I mean you're pretty familiar, right? You came along for this journey in TAVR. And even
though we had nice sales for TAVR in Europe, they really didn't take off until we had the pivotal data in
the U.S. that made a significant step-up with those big pivotal studies. Now having said that, kind of like
TAVR, there's a lot of excitement on the part of clinicians to treat their tricuspid patients. There aren't
many answers for them. And so they're anxious to have solutions. So if we can deliver some results, we
think it could be interesting. But by predicting the tricuspid adoption rate is still very difficult. I think it's
going to be so important for us to get some long-term results on that before we can make it. We have a
lot of studies coming in TRISCEND II the class, which is the EVOQUE trial. We have the EVOQUE TR pivotal
trial. We have CLASP II, which is the tricuspid trial. So we have real trials that are pointed at and are
exploring this and finding the answer to your question, but it's still early, Larry.

Yes. That's a good question. It's interesting. Almost the more -- more we learn about AS, the more
we learn about AS. The market turns out to be pretty significant of people that are undiagnosed and
not really in the system. And so it's difficult for us to say that quantitatively. We are -- we do think the
asymptomatic patients is a significant population, and we think that the moderate AS is also a very
significant population. We haven't been able to accurately size those at this point. That'd be a good one
maybe for us to get a little deeper when we're together in December. But this one, we're confident that it's
a driver and going to be a driver on a very long-term basis, but it's not clear what the size is at this point.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Understood. And one quick one for Scott. Maybe when you look at the spending for '21, Scott, as
marketing spend comes back, clinical trials open up, reopen or restart, I guess, how should we think about
OpEx? And anything on the FX dynamics for next year when you think about gross margins?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Well, it's early to talk about what our operating margins may look like in 2021, although I'll tell, we're
eager to get back to full pace of travel, being out in the field of being with customers and of ramping our
clinical trials back up to fully pre-COVID levels. And so we're anticipating that those expenses will ramp as
quickly as we're allowed to do it.

In terms of FX for 2021, it's just premature to say. I mean you know what happened in 2020, which is we
expected a big headwind from FX to sales ends up that's dissipated. Now we're expecting no headwinds to
sales for FX. And so it just -- it's premature to speculate what that's going to look like in 2021, although
we will be talking more about that at our investor conference when we give guidance in December.

Brandon Vazquez
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

This is Brandon on for Margaret. First one I just had on at TCT this year, there was a lot of presentations
or a lot of focus within the valve and valve I guess, treatment opportunity. Just curious how meaningful
this is today in practice? Or is this more kind of a clinical focus? And do you guys think that the data that's
been collected so far is compelling enough to convince physicians to treat low-risk patients while we're
kind of waiting for long-term durability data. And there was even some TAVR within SAVR. So is that a
meaningful opportunity as we move forward?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We're really pleased to report that 5-year data of about in their TAVR and TAVR. If you will. And it
said, "Hey, pretty good quality of life and so forth maintained through 5 years. And that data is always
valuable. A little bit of what you have to do is to put it in perspective. Remember, that data goes back
quite a ways. And so at that time, I'm not sure we even had intermediate approved for very long. And
so the average age of those patients were nearly 80 years old. So they were sick and at high-risk. And
when -- if you just take a look and see what those results look like and then in this fast-moving TAVR
world, where improvements have been significant, we would expect that as technologies improve and we
move to lower risk patients with those results get even better. Just having a valve and a valve option for
these younger patients with tissue valves or transcatheter valves is a big deal for them to be able to avoid
surgery. So we think it's something -- the clinical community and patients, especially really value.

of discussed that it's been broad adoption within all risk classes. Any specific risk classes kind of leading
the rebound now? And kind of are you happy with the progress being made into the low-risk opportunity
even through COVID?

Michael A. Mussallem

Yes. Thanks. Yes. No, we don't have any particular visibility of these patients by risk level that gives us
deeper insight to the question you're asking about what we're seeing right now. So we just don't have
much on that. In terms of the adoption of low risk, we saw a pretty steep inflection point once the data
was presented last year. It's getting to a point now where it's been out there for more than a year. We're
still seeing steady increases, but not at the same pace that we saw when it was first introduced last year.
