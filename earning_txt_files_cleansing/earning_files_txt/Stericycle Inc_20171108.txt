Finally, I would like to highlight that the company is in the process of renewing and extending its existing senior credit facility and term loans
We are capitalizing on current favorable debt markets and economic conditions
We appreciate the continued support from our banking partners and will provide further details when the financing is complete
I will now turn it over to Brent
And I think Ryan, specifically you are asking about the revised guidance are you looking just specifically for the Q4 results?
Sure
Let me take you through that
It will probably be easier if I first take you through the bridge to the current quarter, because that will have impact obviously in the Q4. So, when you think about Q4, the Street consensus was at $1.14 and our guidance was $1.13 to $1.19. The Q3 adjusted EPS came in at $1.10. EPS from operations fell short of street expectations by about $0.05 primarily due to the lower M&I volume, some higher costs in Latin America and the multiple hurricanes in the quarter
We had about $0.01 tax headwind that was more than offset by $0.02 of favorability of the repo or mandatory preferred convertible
So, that gets you to hit the current quarter
When you think about going forward, if you take the Q3 EBITDA miss, that was about $0.04 on the low end and $0.10 on the high end, so that gets factored into the go forward rate
We will add to that the repo, the $0.02 of repo that we got in Q3. The rest of these are impacts that we can carry forward into Q4. For M&I and the continuation of the weakness in the market, we see about $0.05 on the low end and $0.07 on the high end
If you saw the bridge that Charlie gave for the revenue, you saw that we tightened our regulated waste and compliance services revenue really taking the top end down, so that’s really no change on the bottom end and about $0.02 off on the high end
We anticipate that the hurricane, both in Puerto Rico as well as the impacts in the Gulf Coast region to be potentially another $0.01 headwind going into Q4. Our international business with some revenue impacts in EMEA as well as those cost pressures we discussed in Latin America to be about $0.05 on the low end, $0.07 on the high end
As you have seen, paper prices have come down and so what we are simply doing is trimming a couple of pennies off the top end of the range as a result of the direction paper is going, so that no change in the bottom end and $0.02 on the top
To offset this, we have anywhere from $0.03 to $0.08 of favorability and that will come as a result of some improved benefit costs we are experiencing as well as rationalizing our bonus program to account for the change in our guidance
And then finally, we have about $0.01, the $0.02 favorability due to lower interest rates
So, what you are seeing is the ultimate change is about $0.09 on the bottom end and $0.17 on the top for a midpoint of $0.13.
And just to add to that, so as you go into Q4, you would expect in the range of the $1.12 to $1.18.
Yes, Michael, I think – in the organic growth rate of our Secure Information Destruction, it was about 1% of that 6.4% growth
Just to add to that, one of the things that’s so important is to take this time prior to the implementation of an ERP really aligns our organizational structure and our processes not only does it create some opportunity to create efficiencies in advance of that, but it really highly increases the likelihood of having a very successful implementation by preparing the organization in advance not only led to a broader context of business transformation leading to work up to and then including the ERP implementation
Yes, just to add to that, as you recall and I think Charlie did a great job highlighting that the differences is that back when the M&I kind of retraction in that market began Stericycle lagged that for a couple of quarters
And so it’s not a complete surprise to us that if there is significant rebound, because of our niche orientation that we may lag on the way back up
Yes, let me take that, Hamzah
First of all, as you know, the starts that we have giving guidance on this call, but obviously wanted to be consistent with industry peers and best practice standards
So, we are not to give guidance initial guidance until our Q4 results
Obviously, we will get improved visibility into the coming year because we will have Q4 and we will have January results
We will have greater visibility to our SQ pricing at that time and the business transformation savings and costs
So, those will have an impact on 2018. So, we are not giving official guidance
What you maybe jumped on the call and heard is that just directionally we think our end markets are strong, we are going to maintain and grow the business in the long-term and we feel at this point at a very, very high level from an earnings perspective anticipate that our ‘18 earnings will be flat versus ‘17. Again, we are going to get a lot more detailed guidance on the Q4 call in February
Yes, I think any time you want to characterize market is competitive like we have, it’s certainly is a competitive market and I think pricing comes in a play, when you’re talking about these projects
I don’t know if it’s got any worse over the last 3 to 6 months not really, I don’t think so, but it is, it remains a very competitive marketplace
And just to add to that just in the overall changes to our range is remember we set some favorability in foreign exchange is built into those numbers across all four of those revenue streams, it’s about $8 million in foreign exchange and about $1 million due to the impact of acquisitions
I think Barbara when you are looking at the EBITDA margins, certainly as you described it some of the shortfalls, remember a big impact of that is the $14 million and revenue shortfall and that kind of flows through
And as you indicated that some of those that flow through at less margins and then we had the impact of the Hurricane included partly to offset that though we did have some benefit from the C&RS business
They have about 21 basis points of better improvement or better flow-through and profitability at what they had and then we saw some favorability in the benefits, but also based off the results, we did rationalize our bonus approvals to get in the range of states the current performance of the company
Yes, absolutely
So, if you look at where we are trending for the quarter and as we took the opportunity in the fourth quarter to really narrow our ranges, we have been operating to the mid to the low end of the range
So, when you see the adjustments that we did by bringing up the bottom or bringing your top-down to 20 which you are really seeing is just an adjustment only the top end of the range, but no change to the bottom end of the range
It’s just a result of tightening of ranges
