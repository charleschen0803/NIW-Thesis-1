Thanks, Phil
As in prior quarters, I'll start by sharing some color on our new product launches
As you can see on the graph on slide 15, our new products generated over $700 million of revenue this quarter, led by Trulicity and Cyramza
This represents over 12% of our total worldwide revenue, up from 10% last quarter
And, as Phil mentioned earlier, these products drove 8.9 percentage points of our worldwide volume growth this quarter
Trulicity performance continues to be strong
Here in the U.S
, we're excited that our new-to-brand share with endocrinologists, which we view as a leading indicator, is now comparable to Victoza
In addition to our strong performance, we're also benefiting from growth of the class, with the U.S
GLP-1 market growing nearly 30%
As I mentioned last quarter, in many OUS markets we're seeing uptake comparable to that seen with the early uptake of Victoza
Cyramza continues to grow globally, driven largely by Japan, where we're seeing early strong growth and early adoption in gastric cancer, and more recently have begun to see uptake in lung and colorectal cancer
OUS markets now account for nearly two-thirds of our worldwide Cyramza sales, and we look forward to continued growth in these markets
Cyramza sales declined this quarter
Moving to Jardiance, we continue to see strong uptake, with our new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists at 35%, exceeding Invokana
As mentioned earlier, in December we received FDA approval of the CV indication, and the ADA also updated its diabetes treatment guidelines
As we stated in the past, we expect these two milestones to be catalysts for the growth of Jardiance and the SGLT-2 class
We continued to see rapid uptake of Talts, which launched in the U.S
in April last year and has served as a catalyst for continued growth of the IL-17A class of psoriasis
We're pleased that our new-to-brand share of market with dermatologists, a proxy for use in psoriasis, already exceeds that of Enbrel and Cosentyx
On Basaglar, we launched here in the U.S
in mid-December
The $16 million in U.S
sales we booked were largely due to initial stocking
Physician feedback has been positive so far, and we look forward to providing a more detailed update on our next earnings call
In the fourth quarter, we also launched Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma, with product becoming available in the U.S
in late October
Our Q4 U.S
sales of $11 million were largely driven by demand
In Europe, Lartruvo was approved in mid-November, and we booked initial sales during December in Germany and Austria
Finally, we continued to see strong uptake of I-O agents in first-line squamous non-small-cell lung cancer affecting use of Portrazza
Now moving to slide 16, you'll see that changes in foreign exchange rates had a minimal effect on our Q4 2016 results
Growth in non-GAAP EPS was 22% including the effect of FX and 19% in constant currency terms
For the full year, FX provided a slight drag on our financial results
Specifically, revenue grew 6% with FX and 7% in constant currency terms, while non-GAAP EPS grew 3% with FX and 7% in constant currency
Moving on to our pipeline update, slide 17 shows our NME pipeline as of January 18. Over the past three months, most of the movement has been in Phase 1. You will see the Phase 3 attrition of solanezumab for mild Alzheimer's disease with the A4 study in pre-clinical AD now reflected as the lead indication for solanezumab
You'll also see a red symbol in Phase 1 reflecting our decision to stop development of A-beta Fab PEGs
Several assets entered Phase 1, including the addition of the A-beta 1 to 42-specific antibodies from our expanded collaboration with AstraZeneca, and the entry of a BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease, two diabetes molecules, and one molecule in both cancer and immunology
One other update; you may have seen Adocia's press release last Friday announcing that we decided to return the ultra-rapid insulin we'd been developing together
We have an alternative ultra-rapid insulin in development that could begin Phase 3 testing before the end of 2017, consistent with the information on our 2017 key events slide
In our NILEX pipeline on slide 18, you'll see two U.S
approvals in the Jardiance family, the CV indication for Jardiance as well as the once-daily combination of Jardiance and metformin
And as mentioned earlier, you'll see attrition of the solanezumab EXPEDITION-PRO study in patients with prodromal AD
Turning to slide 19, let's recap the recent progress we've made on the key events we projected for 2016. Since our last call, we added checkmarks for the European approval of Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma and, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, the U.S
approval of the CV indication for Jardiance, the European update of the Jardiance label to reflect the EMPA-REG OUTCOME data, and the European approval of Glyxambi for Type 2 diabetes
Finally, you'll see a checkmark to reflect the EXPEDITION3 readout
Slide 20 shows potential key events for 2017. And even though we're only a few weeks into the year, we have had a number of our few key events occur already
Importantly, as Dave mentioned earlier, the U.S
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent is valid and would be infringed by the generic challenger's proposed product
And early this month we closed the acquisition of BI's U.S
feline, canine, and rabies vaccines portfolio
You'll also see that we've added an entry for the CoLucid acquisition, which we hope to close this quarter, as well as an entry to reflect Merck's recent announcement that the U.S
FDA granted Priority Review with an action date in May for Merck's sBLA submission for Keytruda in combination with Alimta and carboplatin in first-line metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer based on the KEYNOTE-021G data
Turning to our 2017 financial guidance on slide 21, our expectations for 2017 are largely unchanged from when we originally issued our financial guidance in mid-December
You'll see that our non-GAAP line item guidance remains the same
We have adjusted our GAAP financial guidance, specifically the tax rate and EPS, primarily to reflect the estimated charge related to the pending acquisition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals
As usual, we've listed the FX rates assumed in our guidance for the euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound
In aggregate, current spot rates are modestly worse
However, FX rates have not moved enough to cause us to change our 2017 guidance
We're just one month into the year, and we'll monitor rates going forward as well as underlying business trends to determine what changes, if any, are appropriate to our 2017 guidance when we provide our quarterly update
Before we go to the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up
As we exit 2016, our growth prospects are coming into sharper focus
We have significant opportunities to drive growth over the balance of this decade from the product launches currently underway, with three more new product launches possible before the end of 2018. This should allow us to deliver innovation to patients that fundamentally changes expectations for the outcomes they can achieve and to deliver value to the healthcare system and to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders
Our management team will be focused on execution to realize the potential of these opportunities
We'll be focused on: launching new products with excellence; reloading our late-stage pipeline from inside and outside our walls with assets of equal or greater value than our graduating class; driving increased productivity across our enterprise to expand our operating margins and create investment capacity; and investing in the core drivers of our business, talent, scientific capability, and technology platforms, to ensure our future growth prospects
While policy and environmental uncertainty are high, we see our innovation strategy to drive volume growth through new brands as both valuable and durable
In my 26 years with the company, I can't remember a more exciting time
This concludes our prepared remarks
Now I'll turn the call over to Phil to moderate the Q&A session
The good news is there's no substitute for top line growth, and so having the 7% revenue growth or in the quarter the new products driving almost 9 percentage points of volume-driven growth is tremendous, and really the kudos go to the team in pulling that off
When you get to the gross margin percent, you did not see the improvement you may have been expecting
That's really driven more by mix
So in the quarter you did see, for example, on our insulin business, where you'll see as it gets more weight and we have negative pricing in that regime, that becomes a drag on our gross margin percent
And for now, insulin still is our largest product until the other new products catch up
So what you really saw in the quarter was more a mix effect
In regards to your question regarding the dual-eligibles, the best way that I could probably characterize that is that the impact of that would be on the order of magnitude on the industry of the Affordable Care Act is how you should be thinking about it
Jami, this is Derica
Just to maybe add a little bit of color to Dave's comments, recall that the guidance that we provided said we get to 50% by 2018. We also on that same guidance, going back to last summer and our July earnings call, we said we would improve our gross margins between then and the end of this decade
And our starting point was around the mid-70s for gross margin
So that implies that at least at a minimum by 2018, our operating margins will be at least 25% or greater
So if OpEx is 50% of our revenue line, today our gross margin is around 75%, or said differently, our COS is around 25%, so if we get to 50%, we maintain or improve on the 25%
That implies that the floor and operating margin you should be looking at in 2018 is a minimum of 25%
And so to Dave's point is, that's what we said we will get to by 2018. We never said that we will end there, that that wasn't the end goal
That was the intermediate goal
And so there's still progress being made
Regarding your question pertaining to guidance, having been in this job for a while, it's been a wonderful ride
If you look at the last few years, we have exceeded our guidance in some of those years
However, in 2016 we actually came in on the lower end of our guidance, if you think about the range that we provided
So it's not only always true that we've exceeded
But when I think about 2016 performance, what we really are encouraged by and I am is the way we ended the year with very strong revenue performance
We're driving 8 or almost 9 full percentage points of growth from our new product launches
It's very much living up to the expectation that we had set when we provided our outlook for the YZ period
And having achieved that, then it does give us opportunities, as Jami was saying in her earlier question, to work on the middle of the income statement to improve our margins
And so given the way that we finished the year, I'm highly encouraged about our prospects for 2017. I think our guidance is very reasonable
I think our ability to achieve the range of $4.05 to $4.15 in EPS is very much within our grasp
And it implies that we're going to take those top line trends and we're going to translate that into about 300 basis points of OpEx through sales growth and achievement (1:10:41)
So that's what we're going to be focused on
And I think Dave summed it up well when we were all out at the JPMorgan Conference together, launch with excellence, improve our margins through productivity, and you'll continue to hear us talking about in 2017 as well as to how we're advancing our pipeline
And so that is something I want to make sure we don't lose sight of because that's what long term continues to make this engine grow
Hi, Marc
We did have a $130 million gross net benefit in the fourth quarter
What we've said is that a good portion, a sizable portion of that is attributable to Humalog
But we have not provided the absolute numbers behind it or any of the other products affected
