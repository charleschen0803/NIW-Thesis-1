LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Lamb Weston Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Today's conference is
being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor
Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead.

Dexter P. Congbalay
Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This
morning, we issued our earnings release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note
that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected
performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially
due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our
SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.

Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures
should be -- should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP
results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.

With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rob McNutt, our Chief
Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment, while Rob will provide
some details on our second quarter results as well as some shipment trends for the third quarter.

With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid financial
results in the second quarter as our entire Lamb Weston team continues to execute well through this
challenging environment. That's only possible because of their ongoing commitment to serving our
customers, suppliers and communities, and I can't thank them enough for their dedication and support.
Our second quarter results also reflect operating conditions that were generally similar to what we
experienced in the first quarter. Overall, restaurant traffic in the U.S. was resilient by holding steady at
around 90% of pre-pandemic levels for much of the quarter. However, traffic and frozen potato demand
rates continue to vary widely by channel.

Traffic at large chain restaurants were essentially at prior year levels as quick-service restaurants
continued to leverage drive-through, takeout and delivery formats. Traffic at full-service restaurants was
70% to 80% of prior year levels for much of the quarter.

However, traffic began to soften in November as governments reimposed social and on-premise dining
restrictions in an effort to contain the resurgence of COVID and as the onset of colder weather tempered
outdoor dining opportunities across many markets.

Traffic and demand at noncommercial customers, which includes lodging, hospitality, health care, schools
and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environment, was fairly steady at around 50%
of prior year levels for the entire quarter. In retail, consumer demand continued to be strong with weekly
category volume growth between 15% and 20% versus the prior year.

Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic and fry demand were uneven across markets and varied within the
quarter. In Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand during much of
the quarter was similar to last year but softened to 75% to 85% of prior year levels during the latter part
of the quarter as governments reimposed social restriction and as the weather turned colder. As you may
recall, unlike in the U.S., QSRs in Europe generally have only limited drive-through capabilities.

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

Demand in our other key international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand was near prior
year levels. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, overall demand improved sequentially
from our first quarter but remained well below prior year levels.

Going forward, we expect many of the softer traffic and demand trends that we began to see in November
to carry over into our fiscal third quarter. The sharp resurgence of COVID in the U.S. and Europe has led
governments to impose even more rigid social restrictions. In addition, we expect outdoor restaurant
dining traffic in our largest markets to fall further as we enter the coldest months of the year in the
northern hemisphere. Not surprisingly, we expect traffic at full-service restaurants will continue to be
disproportionately affected. Major QSR chains in the U.S. should be able to continue to hold up well due
to their ability to serve customers via drive-through and delivery. Retail should also benefit as consumers
eat more meals at home. And as Rob will discuss later, while still early, our shipments to those channels in
December support that view.

So on the one hand, in the near term, we anticipate facing even more challenging and volatile operating
conditions than what we experienced in the first half of our fiscal year. On the other hand, we believe
this COVID-induced shock to demand is temporary. We're confident in the strength of the frozen potato
category and do not see any structural impediments to recovery in demand and growth over the long
term.

As COVID vaccines become more widely available in the coming months and as the virus is more broadly
contained, we expect governments will gradually lift social restrictions. This should lead to steady growth
in restaurant traffic as the year progresses. We believe this growth will lead to overall frozen potato
demand approaching pre-pandemic levels on a run rate basis by the end of calendar 2021.

In the meantime, we're confident in our business fundamentals, the pricing, capacity utilization and potato
supply and our ability to manage through the pandemic's impacts on our manufacturing operations.

Our recently announced increase in our quarterly dividend and the planned resumption of our share
repurchase program reinforce our conviction in the strength of our business and the category as well as
our commitment to support customers and create value for our stakeholders.

In summary, we delivered solid Q2 results and are executing well in a challenging environment. We expect
frozen potato demand to soften in the near term due to reduced traffic following government reimposed
social restrictions as well as the onset of colder weather. And we're optimistic that the increasing
availability of COVID vaccines will enable restaurant traffic to gradually improve as the year progresses,
and that demand will approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar 2021.

Now let me turn the call over to Rob.

Robert M. McNutt
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered solid financial results in the second
quarter as our teams continued to manage through an ever-changing demand environment as well as
COVID-related disruptions to our manufacturing and distribution networks. For the quarter, net sales
declined 12% to $896 million. Sales volume was down 14%, largely due to fry demand at restaurants
and food service being negatively impacted following government-imposed restrictions to contain the
spread of COVID as well as colder weather beginning to limit outdoor dining across many of our markets.
In addition, volume was down as we lapped the benefit of additional shipping days related to the timing of
Thanksgiving last year.

Overall, as Tom described earlier, restaurant traffic and our sales volumes in the U.S. stabilized at
approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels, although performance varied widely by sales channel.
International sales were mixed but improved sequentially versus our first quarter. Price/mix increased 2%
driven by improved price in our foodservice and retail segments as well as favorable mix in retail. Gross
profit declined $62 million as lower sales and higher manufacturing costs more than offset the benefit of
favorable price/mix and productivity savings.

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we expected our manufacturing costs to increase in the
quarter. This was partly due to processing potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which
is a couple of months longer than usual. We did this in order to manage finished goods inventories in light
of the pandemic's impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in increased cost due to significant
-- due to higher raw material storage fees and lower recovery rates. Since we typically carry upwards of
60 days of finished goods inventory, we realized the impact of these costs in our second quarter income
statement as we sold that inventory.

We also realized higher manufacturing costs due to input cost inflation, primarily related to edible oils, raw
potatoes and other raw ingredients. Overall, our input cost inflation was in the low single digits.

Finally, we continue to realize incremental costs and inefficiencies resulting from the pandemic's disruptive
effect on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. As a reminder, these costs largely relate to
labor and other costs to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID;
costs associated with modifying production schedules, reducing run times and manufacturing retail
products online primarily designed for foodservice products; and costs for enhancing employee safety and
sanitation protocols; as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs.

Specifically in the quarter, we had notable disruptions in our facilities in Idaho as well as lesser ones in
some other facilities. We expect to continue to incur COVID-related costs through at least the remainder
of fiscal 2021. As a result, we consider these costs and disruptions as part of our ongoing operations and
are no longer disclosing these costs separately. SG&A declined by nearly $8 million in the quarter, largely
due to lower incentive compensation expense accruals and a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and
promotional expense. The decline was partially offset by investments to improve our operations and IT
infrastructure, which included about $5 million of nonrecurring consulting and training expenses associated
with implementing Phase 1 of our new ERP system.

Equity-method earnings were $19 million, which is up $4 million versus last year. Excluding the impact
of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased about $2 million due to better
performance by our European joint venture. However, like in the U.S., our shipments softened during
the latter part of the quarter, reflecting the effect on restaurant traffic of governments reimposing social
restrictions as well as colder weather on outdoor dining.

EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $213 million, which is down $48 million. The decline was driven by
lower income from operations and was partially offset by higher equity-method earnings.

Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.66, down $0.29 largely due to lower income from operations. EPS was
also down due to higher interest expense, reflecting our higher average total debt and the write-off of
some debt issuance costs as we paid off a term loan a year early. The decline was partially offset by higher
equity earnings.

Moving to our segments. Sales for our global segment, which generally includes sales for the top 100
North American-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America,
were down 12% in the quarter. Volume was down 11% due to softer demand for fries outside the home,
especially in our international markets. Shipments to large chain restaurant customers in the U.S., of
which approximately 85% are to QSRs, approached prior year levels as QSRs leverage drive-through and
delivery formats. However, some of that strength also reflected pulling forward sales of customized and
limited time offering products from the third quarter.

International sales, which historically comprised about 40% of segment sales, were at about 80% of prior
year levels in the aggregate but varied by market. Shipments in China and Australia approached prior year
levels. Our shipments to other parts of Asia and Latin America improved sequentially as customers and
distributors in many of these markets were able to rightsize inventories. However, they remain well below
prior year levels.

Price/mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Price alone was flat. Global's product contribution
margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined 28% to $93 million. Lower sales volume, higher
manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline.

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant
chains generally outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 21% in the quarter.
Volume declined 25%. Segments to smaller chain and independent full-service and quick-service
restaurants tracked around 70% to 80% of prior year levels through much of October but slowed to 60%
to 70% in November following governments reimposing social restrictions and as colder weather tempered
restaurant traffic in some of our markets.

Shipments to noncommercial customers improved modestly since summer but remain at around 50%
of prior year levels, with strength in health care more than offset by continued weakness in the other
channels.

Price/mix increased 4% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of fiscal
2020. Mix continued to be unfavorable with some hard-hit independent restaurants looking to reduce costs
by purchasing more value-added products rather than the premium Lamb Weston branded ones. While
we've regained much of this business since the pandemic first struck last spring, on a year-over-year
basis, it remains a mix headwind.

Foodservice's product contribution margin declined 21% to $88 million. Lower sales volumes, higher
manufacturing costs and unfavorable mix drove the decline and was partially offset by favorable price.
Sales for our retail segment increased 7% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 7%, primarily reflecting
favorable mix benefit of selling more of our higher-margin branded portfolio of Alexa -- Alexia grown in
Idaho and licensed restaurant trademarks. Volume increased nominally. Sales of our branded products
were up about 30%, which is well above category growth rates, which ranged between 15% and 20%.
The increase in our branded volume was offset by the loss of certain low-margin private label volume that
began late in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as an additional amount that began a couple of
months ago. As a result, we expect private label losses to continue to be a headwind.

Retail's product contribution margin increased 6% to $30 million. The increase was driven by favorable
mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.

Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. We're comfortable with our liquidity position and confident
in our ability to continue to generate cash. In the first half, we generated nearly $320 million of cash from
operations, which is down about $25 million versus last year due to lower sales and earnings. We spent
$54 million in CapEx, including expenditures for our new ERP system. We paid $67 million in dividends
and a few weeks ago announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend. In addition, we plan to resume
our share repurchase program this quarter. As you may recall, we temporarily suspended our buyback
program in late fiscal 2020 in order to help preserve our liquidity during the early days of the pandemic.

As we discussed in our previous earnings call, in September, we amended our credit agreement to put in
place a new 3-year $750 million revolver. At the same time, using a portion of the more than $1 billion of
cash on hand, we prepaid the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was
due in November of 2021.

At the end of the second quarter, we had more than $760 million of cash on hand and our new revolver
was undrawn. Our total debt was $2.75 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.1x.

Now turning to our shipments so far in the third quarter. Broadly speaking, in the U.S., demand at QSRs
and at retail are holding up well while traffic at full-service restaurants continues to soften. Specifically,
U.S. shipments in the 4 weeks ending December 27 were approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our
global segments, shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain customers in the U.S. were more than
95% of prior year levels. We expect that rate will largely continue for the remainder of the third quarter.

In our Foodservice segment, shipments to our full service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and
noncommercial customers in aggregate were 60% to 65% of prior year levels. That is largely in line with
what we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We anticipate that shipments to full-service
restaurants and small and regional QSRs will continue to soften as social restrictions broaden and as
winter weather takes a bigger bite out of outdoor dining.

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

Shipments to noncommercial customers, which have historically comprised about 25% of the segment's
volume were roughly half of prior year levels and will likely remain soft for the remainder of the quarter.

In our retail segments, shipments were above prior year levels with strong volume of our branded
products partially offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. We believe that this rate will
largely continue for the remainder of the quarter.

Outside the U.S., overall demand has slowed but is varied by market. In Europe, shipments by our Lamb
Weston/Meijer joint venture were approximately 85% of prior year levels, continuing the softer demand
that we realized during the latter part of the second quarter. We believe that shipments will continue to
soften due to severe social restrictions and colder weather. Shipments to our other international markets,
which primarily include Asia, Oceana, Latin America, were mixed. In aggregate, international shipments so
far in the quarter have been softer than what we realized during the latter half of the second quarter. As a
reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our global results.

In short, other than U.S. at QSRs, which can leverage drive-through access, global demand for fries at
restaurants and foodservice will be soft in the third quarter following government's reimposing restrictions
to combat the resurgence of COVID as well as colder weather in our northern hemisphere markets limits
outdoor dining opportunities.

With respect to contract pricing, after completing discussions for contracts that were up for renewal, we
expect pricing across our domestic large chain restaurant portfolio in aggregate to be flat versus prior
year. Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts on balance, domestic pricing is holding up well.
However, we continue to see increased competitive activity in more value-oriented products in some
international markets and, to a lesser extent, in some value-tiered domestic market segments.

With respect to costs, the potato crop in our growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and
the Upper Midwest is consistent with historical averages in aggregate. We don't see any notable impact on
cost outside of inflation.

Crop in our growing areas in Europe is also broadly consistent with historical averages, which should help
ease cost pressures there versus last year. However, we do expect to continue to incur additional cost as a
result of COVID's disruptive impact on our manufacturing and supply chain operations and we expect that
we'll continue to do so until the virus is broadly contained.

Now here's Tom for some closing comments.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Rob. Let me just quickly sum up by saying while the near-term environment will be volatile, we
believe that the restaurant traffic will gradually recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar
2021. We'll continue to focus on the right strategic and operating priorities to serve our customers and
build upon the long-term health of the category in order to create value for our stakeholders.
Thank you for joining us today, and we're now ready to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Two questions for me, if I could. First, with visibility to getting back to pre-pandemic levels of demand by
calendar year-end, I'm curious if there are any signs you are seeing of any lasting shifts in competitive
dynamics among sort of the key North American players that could result in Lamb Weston coming out of
this in a stronger relative position than it went in.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Andrew. So I think, right now, the industry, we're all navigating through the pandemic. And from
Lamb Weston's standpoint, our strategy has not changed. And while we have paused a few things that we
were thinking about pre-pandemic, I will tell you that we're actively engaged in some projects. And it's all
about positioning this company as we believe the demand is going to return by calendar year. And if you
think about 18 months from now, we’ve got to be ready to capture share demand across the whole globe.
So while we have paused a few things, we have reengaged in some things, projects that we're working on.
And we're going to move those forward and get ourselves in position 12 to 18 months from now to capture
the demand that we believe is going to come back to pre-pandemic levels.

Andrew Lazar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's a good segue into my second question, which is I know it's an odd time in some regards to ask
about incremental industry capacity. But if you see frozen potato demand approaching pre-pandemic
levels again by calendar year-end and then assuming demand globally grows at normalized levels from
there and knowing it takes a few years to get new capacity for the industry online, when would you think
we might hear of new industry capacity additions being announced, whether that be Lamb Weston or
others?

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. One of our competitors, they're in the process of expanding capacity that they were working on pre-
pandemic. From our standpoint, again, we've got some things that we're moving forward. And at the right
time, and we'll do all the work around it, we'll make that decision.

The other thing that -- one of the silver linings with all this is we've really focused internally on
our efficiency and operating efficiencies within our current footprint. And it's giving us visibility to
opportunities, we believe, within the current manufacturing footprint to unlock capacity. So that's
something that the supply chain team in Lamb Weston is focused on. We have a big initiative within supply
chain to unlock capacity and drive efficiencies.

And if you think about, Andrew, the timing of new capacity versus what we have in our current footprint,
I'm 100% confident that with our supply chain initiative unlock hidden capacity in our current footprint
that we're absolutely in a great position as demand returns to support not only our current customers
as their business returns, but also future demand and category growth. So I feel we're in a really good
position. But again, at the right time, we've got to make those decisions in terms of getting ourselves
ready for demand resurgence 18, 24 months out.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So I guess my first question is really related to some of the pricing comments that you made earlier, just
some of the -- where you're seeing some of that incremental competitive activity. Internationally, is that
-- would you --I presume that's in your export markets out of the U.S., not in the European JV. But is that
European competitors who are looking to push into Asia? Just help me think about -- frame where you're
seeing that. And is that places they haven't played before?

And then domestically, in the value-tier side, is that just European imports into the East Coast? Just help
me think about the origin of that competitive threat and how salient and how much of your volumes are
really framing in the exposure there?

Robert M. McNutt
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Adam, this is Rob. In terms of the pricing internationally, it is a mix of where that's coming from, the
competitive. Some of that in some markets where there is some of that lower-end production is coming
from local producers just running the cash flow, and some of it is coming from excess capacity in Europe.
Similarly in the U.S., again, it's in that lower-end value market, and we have seen some increases from
the Europeans that is certainly having some impact in that limited part of the market.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

And just any way, Tom, you could help think about just how much of that -- of your business is really in
those kinds of categories where you're seeing. I'm just trying to contextualize the pockets where there is a
little bit of competitive intensity.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Adam, we don't necessarily disclose that. But to Rob's point, it's the lower line flow, what we call
it. So it's really not a material piece of our business. The point is it's more pronounced in Asia, and the
Europeans are being competitive in Asia. And it's not one market specifically. It's random markets in Asia.

And our teams did a good job trying to hold serve. But when you get in those situations, customers are
going to think about going a different direction. But we're watching it closely. It is more pronounced than
it has been. But I will say, it's nothing that we're not used to dealing with. It's just more aggressive. And
the team will work through it and capture opportunities where we can.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's real helpful. And then my second one was going to be, as we think about the fiscal third
quarter and volumes slowing down from where they were, I mean, seemingly a little bit more orderly than
you might have been in the spring. I'm just trying to make sure I'm sensitive in thinking about the gross
margin implications of softer volumes in the near term and just the levers you can pull or just the ability
to plan better to manage that lower volume near term.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll talk to the patterns, and then Rob, you can hit the margin. If you think back through the initial
start of the whole pandemic, our business evaporated. We're down 60% in total, 50%, 60%. So as
we look over this next quarter, while our -- we're seeing softness in some of the channels, specifically
foodservice. I don't believe it's going to be anywhere near it was when all this thing started.

Now that said, we gave guidance on what's happening through December. And I think that's going to be
where it plays out over the next 30, 60 days. We'd get through winter, things are going to open back up.

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

The most important thing for us is to be prepared for the opening back up. And we learned a lot of lessons
last spring as a management team and myself personally that we have to be ready.

And what does that mean? It means if you think about April, May, we're taking some measures right now
to ensure we've got the right inventory, the right products. So when demand snaps back, which we believe
it will in the spring, and start increasing, we can service our customers, all the while recognize that we're
still dealing with manufacturing operating issues because of COVID in terms of efficiencies.

So on the one hand, while things are slowing down in some areas; on the other hand, it's a great
opportunity for us to get ourselves positioned to meet demand when this thing snaps back. So the near
term is going to be volatile. But as we come out, get to spring and summer and you got vaccines and this
thing hopefully starts getting behind us, there's -- I believe there's going to be some pent-up demand for
people to get out -- to go out and eat again. And so we're going to be prepared for that.

Operator

We can now take our next question from Rob Dickerson of Jefferies.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. So just to circle back a couple of comments you made on where you are now in terms of your
inventories and how you have to be ready for potential demand snapback in, let's call it, April, May, June,
whatever it is.

Like how do you feel, I guess, for around -- or about Lamb Weston's current inventory levels and maybe
the industry's inventory levels vis-à-vis some of this hopefully temporary softness into Q3 in part of the
business? Is there -- like if you step back, you say, okay, this is where we are now. This is how many
potatoes we have. This is how many potatoes the industry has. I feel like we forecasted it somewhat
appropriately relative to demand when we go back to March-April of last year.

And now as you sit here and you think about Q3 into the spring and summer, do you say, yes, we still feel
pretty good, the industry feels pretty good about those inventory levels as long as that demand does snap
back, so we're not once again, so to speak, over inventory? Is that fair?

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think my point of view is I believe the industry is balanced from Lamb Weston's standpoint. We're
balanced. I feel good about where we're at on raw availability and our -- what we have in storage to meet
the needs. Even if there's a return to demand, I think we're in good shape.

The thing that we're working on right now is to make sure we got the right inventory levels of product that
was really pulled when the economy opened back up in May, June. And so we've got data, and we can look
and see what the customers, the products, they were -- we were shipping to them. So we're positioning
those products to have a different level of safety stock, if you will, to anticipate that. And so I think we're
in good shape from a finished good inventory, raw inventory.

The thing to remember is the timing of -- whether it's April, May or June, the timing of consumer demand
out -- going out to eat more or maybe it's further down the road, we'll manage it, and we can manage our
production schedules. We can manage inventory levels. So there's things we can do and have done and
always do just to manage the supply and demand side of it. And so I feel good about where we're at now.

Like I said, we're getting ourselves prepared for demand return as we get through Q3. And I think the
company will be in good shape, and we'll react as needed just based on the ordering signals we're getting
from our customers.

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

Rob, the other point I'd make or the distinction -- initially, when the pandemic first hit demand, it felt
like -- we don't have perfect insight into the downstream distribution through the channel. But it felt like
they were working with old models. And so the orders continued to come even as end-user demand was
coming off. We're seeing a quicker adjustment in that now. And so I think as we've learned, they've also
learned, and so that I'm not concerned about downstream channel being overloaded.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then this might be too specific of a modeling question, but I'll give it a shot. So in your
global division organic sales declined 12%. But on a 2-year stack basis, like given the extra shipping days,
maybe some LTOs, it's essentially flat, right? So that's pretty good, all things considered, I'd argue.

If I'm thinking about Q3, you don't have that big, tough compare, so to speak, on the volume side, just
speaking to global. So is there -- like should we be thinking on the global side that sales, the trajectory of
that year-over-year should in theory really improve, assuming that shipments are still pretty good relative
to pre-pandemic? Because it -- it feels like we all want to model down still. But obviously, the year ago
does matter. So just any color on that would be helpful.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I would say that in the QSR side, the big QSRs, that demand seems to be just fine there. They
figured out the model, and they're leveraging the drive-throughs and so forth. In the -- there are other
parts of that business that sell to more sit-down restaurants, and that's going to continue to look like our
Foodservice. And then in our international sales, okay, again, that varies by country. We cited China and
Australia being relatively strong, but there are some other international locations which aren't as strong,
Europe, in particular.

Now recognize Europe is not in our sales line. It's down in the equity earnings. And so in Europe, the QSRs
don't have the drive-through. So we'll have some headwinds there just because they don't have the same
model.

Robert Frederick Dickerson
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just lastly very quickly, I feel like I have to ask, the past month or so, I've had a lot of
investors come to me and say, we've heard there might have been some contract pressure at the larger
QSR domestically. I have no evidence of that. I don't hear you speaking to it. It sounds like things are
pretty good, so to speak, from what I'm hearing. So I thought I'd give you the opportunity to address
that. I just asked because I've had so many people ask me is there any contract pressure in any larger
QSRs? That's all.

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We don't specifically talk about customers and negotiations. What I will tell you is just like every other
year, we go through contract season with our customers, so to speak. And just like last year, just like the
year before, this year, we came through as we expected. And so that's generally where we ended up.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan.

Thomas Hinsdale Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

In the press release and in the prepared remarks, you mentioned your view that the overall frozen potato
industry demand could approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of this calendar year. I just wanted to
clarify how this would apply to Lamb Weston. Would you assume that the company's sales trends would

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

be comparable to the overall industry? Or are there reasons why you might diverge from the industry,
either because of a different channel mix than the industry or because of some customer wins or losses
that have been taking place?

Robert M. McNutt
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Tom, this is Rob. In terms of our overall performance, again, the Foodservice business, that's where
we expect to see the snapback. As we've talked about, the QSRs have largely held their own. So really
in the Foodservice is where we'll see a lot of that strength and so -- and then some of those international
markets that we've talked about that have been a little more challenged. And so those are the areas
where we think we'll see the strength.

And again, as Tom talked about, in terms of the capacity unlocked, the supply chain team is working on.
While we haven't spent the capital for a new line per se, the guys just figuring out some ways to get some
capital out. So if you think about that, the ability to service that capacity, I think our international sales
team is well set up and well positioned. And we've talked about our Foodservice sales team with that
direct sales model that went to being in a favored position relative to maybe some of our competitors who
are more broker-oriented that adjusted their service model a little bit, their cost to that. And so we do feel
good that we'll have relative opportunities.

Thomas Hinsdale Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. So just to clarify, what you mean by that is you think you could either grow with the industry, if not
better when you say return to pre-pandemic?

Robert M. McNutt
Senior VP & CFO

Exactly.

Thomas Hinsdale Palmer
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just wanted to ask, you wrapped up prepared remarks with the commentary on contract
renegotiations. I just wanted to clarify exactly what this means. So you're saying that the contracts that
were renegotiated this year were flat. And then should we assume that the -- the contracts that roll over
have the typical price increases that are normally baked into them? And so the net-net of your contract
basket would be positive? Or do you mean the net-net would be flattish?

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Well, the contracts, as I stated earlier, were -- that we talked about and worked on this year and got
negotiated were at what we expected. And we don't necessarily get into the economics of that. So it's
just we got through it just like we do every other year. And there are some contracts that we have that
there is inflationary pricing mechanisms that are adjusted every year. And those contracts are in place.
Automatically, the changes based on inflation just gets passed through. So that's where we're at, just like
every other year. Nothing's really changed.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Securities, Research Division

So maybe just to pick up first on Tom's question on -- around inflation and pricing and, I guess, more
on just focused on inflation. Can you give us sort of an update on what you're seeing now? I think like
cooking oils have inflated recently. And we know that freight costs are higher. Don't really know -- or

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

would like to maybe get some insight to is in terms of grower inflation. Just is there inflation in things like,
I don't know, fertilizers, seed potatoes, water? Just trying to get a sense of whether or not the industry
or you'll feel maybe a little bit more input inflation as we move into the out-year versus what you've seen
over the last few years?

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Bryan, I'm not -- I'm going to address the crop. As we do every year, we don't get into the specifics
until we get through the negotiating, which -- that's happening as we're talking here. So down the road,
July, October, we'll talk about what the overall crop looks like and the economics of all that, just like we do
every year. So…

Robert M. McNutt
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Bryan, it's Rob. If you think about it, I mean, a lot of that's driven by energy fuel, whether it's diesel
to run the tractor or whether it's gas going into fertilizer production, things like that. And those tend to
move together. You mentioned edible oil specifically. And yes, there's been a little bit of an upswing in the
market. Recognize, we do hedge, and so -- and enter into longer-term contracts in that.

And so if you put all that together, I think that low single-digit inflation overall is what we're looking at in
the near term. And as Tom said, as we go through raw negotiations, we'll see how that comes out.

Bryan Douglass Spillane
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then just a second one related to innovation, pre-pandemic, you look at last year, and there
was some nice upside, I guess, from some of the limited time offers and some of the more value-added
innovation, particularly with QSRs. So as we start to normalize, is there -- can you give us just some color
on what the innovation pipeline may be looking like and whether there's maybe a little bit of maybe a
pipeline, I guess, that's maybe backed up a little bit in terms of getting some new products and some
innovation into the market just because it's been so disrupted over the last 10 or 11 months?

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Bryan, I -- you can understand this. I'm not going to get into a lot of the specifics of some of the
things we're working on. We do have a full pipeline. I will tell you one thing that we are accelerating is
our crispy on delivery offering. And we came out with that about 15 months, 18 months ago, and we're
applying that technology to some different fry formats. So with the -- and it's right in the sweet spot of
delivery and drive-through and all those kind of things. And we're getting some traction on it. It's a small
base, but it's -- the growth on Crispy on Delivery is accelerating.

Operator

We can now take our next question from Chris Growe of Stifel.

Christopher Robert Growe
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Just had a couple of questions. The first one would just be a bit of a follow-on to earlier questions. You did
note the higher cost of processing potatoes out of storage that have been stored longer. I'm just trying to
get a sense of your potato supply and the adjustments you made to supply to potentially avoid that risk
later in the year. Do you feel like you're in a good place on the supply and, therefore, the future cost for
processing those potatoes?

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

Yes. Chris, like I said earlier, we're very well balanced with raw needs based on our latest forecast for the
remainder of the year. So I feel very comfortable where we're at. And just in terms of the raw cost impact
with the demand change, last spring/summer, we made a decision to store and run potatoes longer than
we ever had. And the implications of that is you just don't get the yield that we're used to based on it
stores longer and it just doesn't perform in the factories as well as -- the longer you store it.

So we're through all that. Going forward with the current crop in storage, we will process that on a normal
time line as we have in previous years. So it was just a one-off thing. It was a decision based on the
change in demand to utilize the old crop longer. So it's -- but that's all behind us now.

Christopher Robert Growe
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Got it. That makes sense. I just want to be clear on that. And then I just have a second question.
We've had a number of questions around the large chain contracts and some of the potential pricing
elements. So I'm just curious, are there onetime things you're doing or they may weigh on pricing a bit
that are meant to drive better demand?

I know we've talked about limited time offerings. Quite the opposite of that, there could be an item that
restaurants use to try to regenerate demand. Are there other things -- other things they're doing that
are more pricing and promotion-driven in the short term that weighed on your pricing in those large
contracts?

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

No. The -- we're not seeing anything -- any change that's driving demand. The interesting thing, Chris
-- we obviously look at all kinds of different data. The encouraging thing is the importance of fries on
menu is at an all-time high. Now in theory, if you say, look, if that holds as demand returns, that's going
to further add to overall french fry demand going forward. And that's an interesting thing that we're
monitoring right now to understand. And whether that holds or not remains to be seen.

But again, you look for positives in this, and that's one thing that is really intriguing to us because that
could be -- if it holds to the level it's holding on the importance -- menu importance, that's going to
elevate demand even further than what we believe it's going to come back by the end of the calendar
year, which is close to pre-pandemic levels.

Operator

We can now take our next question from William Reuter of Bank of America.

William Michael Reuter
BofA Securities, Research Division

I just have 2 quick ones. Last quarter, you laid out what the onetime costs were associated with COVID.
I was wondering if you could lay out that again for the second quarter and then what of those will remain
post-COVID.

Robert M. McNutt
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. This is Rob. In terms of the detail of that cost, we've really concluded that those are just part of our
operating cost now. And frankly, if you go back to the first quarter, the pandemic, when we took a write-off
on raw and we were shutting down lines for a long period of time, they were really easy to carve out. We
did give some detail on like what the increased sanitation protocols and so forth and PPE and so forth are
in the plants, and that continues on.

The rest of it, as you bring in lines up and down, it's become more difficult to really separate out what's
operating versus COVID. And so it's just embedded into our cost structure on an ongoing basis now.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

LAMB WESTON HOLDINGS, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 07, 2021

And so clearly, our cost structure should improve as the virus gets less and less and we have less impact
on our crewing and so forth. It's just gotten to the point where it's part of our normal operations of our
business and embedded in our costs. So we're not breaking that out.

William Michael Reuter
BofA Securities, Research Division

That makes sense. And then in terms of the gross margin pressures in the quarter, you had capacity
utilization as well as this aged potato crop that had larger storage costs associated with it. I guess which
one of those was larger? And will we continue to see the headwind of the elevated storage costs on your
potato inventory? Or are we through that?

Robert M. McNutt
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. In terms of the storage cost, that was just the carryover from old crop. We got through the
manufacturer of that crop in the first and early part of the second quarter. And so sitting in inventory and
then sold, and we're out of that now in the second quarter. So we shouldn't see that as a headwind going
forward.

William Michael Reuter
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And I guess just one more, if I can sneak it in. Last time, you gave us an update on your leverage
target. It was 3 to 4x. Is that still the range?

Robert M. McNutt
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We haven't changed our leverage targets at all.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from Carla Casella of JPMorgan.

Carla Casella
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Most of my questions have been answered. But I guess given some of the weakness you're seeing, is --
your ability to pick up new contracts or new business has that changed? You talked about some of the
competition on the lower end and the contracts for the private. But I guess that sounds like it's more your
existing. Can you just talk about new businesses and any opportunities there?

Thomas P. Werner
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's Tom. The team were always talking to potential new customers. Obviously, with the demand
change, those are more difficult. A lot of the customers that we have and talk to is initially, it was about
[ short ] supply. So we got all that settled down as we got through the pandemic. And our team, our sales
team are on the ground, searching for new opportunities, and that really hasn't changed from a market
standpoint.

Operator

And this concludes the Q&A session. Mr. Congbalay, I would like to hand the call back to you now for any
additional or closing remarks.

Dexter P. Congbalay
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you all for joining our second quarter call. If you want to set up a follow-up session, please pass me
an e-mail, and we can get that scheduled. But again, thanks for joining us, and have a good day.
