Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the LabCorp of America Q2 2020
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being
recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today,
Clarissa Willett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Clarissa Willett
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. As
detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and
Internet.

With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website
at labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional
information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial
measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.

Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, statements with respect to expectations for 2020 and the related assumptions,
including the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's businesses, operating results,
cash flow and our financial condition, our responses to and the expected future impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our business more generally as well as on general economic, business and market conditions.

Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change based
upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control that could affect our financial results. Some
of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to
provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.

Now I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Thank you, Clarissa. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.

For more than 50 years, LabCorp has led through science, innovation and technology. During the current
pandemic, that leadership has been front and center when the world has needed us most. I continue to be
impressed with how quickly our teams have rallied to confront each and every challenge put before them.
And I want to thank our 65,000 employees, as their efforts have been heroic during this difficult time.

During the second quarter, we delivered solid performance across the company despite the impact of the
pandemic. We delivered revenue of $2.8 billion, adjusted EPS of $2.57 and free cash flow of $272 million.
We were encouraged to see steady recovery in our base business during the quarter for both Diagnostics
and Drug Development, as people are starting to return to their doctors for testing and clinical trials
activity is resuming, including those that are for COVID-19-related research. More specifically, although
Diagnostics revenue declined 3.9% compared to a year ago, in the month of June, volumes were up year-
over-year. COVID-19-related testing more than offset the decline in the base business.

Our Drug Development business delivered a solid trailing 12 months book-to-bill of 1.32 and our backlog
grew to $11.8 billion compared to $11.3 billion last quarter. We remain committed to bringing the full
power of our combined Diagnostics and Drug Development capabilities against this virus. We'll apply our
scientific expertise and ingenuity across all aspects of testing, treatments and vaccines.

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28,
2020

From the outset, our testing approach has been guided by 3 steadfast principles. First, build as much
capacity as possible, as fast as possible across as many platforms as we can, just move. Second, no one
should be advantaged or disadvantaged based upon ability to pay. We would not charge patients upfront
out-of-pocket cost, and we will use the Medicare price for the PCR test for everyone. And finally, no one
should be prioritized over anyone else. Tests will be performed as they are received. The only exception
has been in response to the guidance to prioritize hospitalized patients. We will continue to work with the
HHS or the CDC if additional priorities identified with them in the future. These principles have guided all
of our decisions and have kept us focused.

Since being the first commercial lab to launch a PCR test in March, we have rapidly expanded both
capacity and accessibility for testing at an astonishing pace. We have performed more than 8.5 million
molecular tests with current capacity of 180,000 tests per day and growing. Molecular testing is now
processed in 16 labs, including our Covance Drug Development central lab in Indianapolis, a great
example of the power of our combined business.

We have significantly expanded accessibility of PCR testing to reach as many people as possible, including
those in underserved communities. Our PCR tests are available through doctors, through hospitals, other
health care providers, retail pharmacy chains, drive-through testing sites and through our website.

We were the first lab authorized for at-home sample collection through our Pixel by LabCorp platform and
recently, the first to offer a seamless digital service to help doctors electronically order a COVID-19 at-
home sample collection for patients as appropriate.

With the rising spread of COVID-19 in the U.S., building further capacity as fast as possible, remains a
priority and a challenge. In recent weeks, the rapid acceleration in sample volumes had outpaced our
capacity and increased time to deliver results to just over 4 days on average. We are now back to a 2-
to 3-day turnaround time on average, with hospital inpatients even faster. We have aggressive efforts
underway despite continued constraints with supplies and equipment to continue to grow testing capacity
across multiple platforms as fast as we can. To help achieve that volume, we received an EUA for pool
testing just last week.

In addition to our PCR testing options, we also offer antibody testing. We began offering antibody testing
in April and had performed more than 2 million tests with capacity for 300,000 tests per day. To make
it easier for employers and large groups to be tested, we launched a fingerstick blood test that detects
antibodies to the virus.

As the economy reopens, we are also helping to guide return-to decisions. We launched LabCorp Employer
services, which provides customized solutions to guide strategies for returning to workplaces and to
universities, and we are connected with hundreds of employers.

Beyond greater testing capacity and access, new treatments and ultimately a vaccine are critical, and
LabCorp is playing an important role there, too. Our enterprise-wide early response team continues to
feel significant volume of client requests to assist in the development of new COVID-19 treatments and
vaccines. We are actively working with many clients, supporting a significant number of opportunities
across all business segments and phases of development, with most in early stages. We launched a
neutralizing antibody test to assess the capability of the capacity of antibodies in patient plasma, which
may help to accelerate the evaluation of vaccines. These achievements clearly demonstrate the depth
of scientific delivery and technological innovations that are hallmarks of LabCorp, coming from both our
Diagnostics and Drug Development businesses.

In addition to our critical work in a fight against COVID-19, we continue to advance our strategic priorities,
which include the following: leveraging the power of our combined capabilities; leading in oncology;
integrating data analytics, AI and digitalization across our business; putting customers at the center of all
we do; and maximizing high-growth opportunities. Many of the innovations I've just shared with you have
helped to advance these priorities in meaningful ways.

Importantly, oncology continues to be an area of focus. During the quarter, we launched a liquid biopsy
test for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. It's available exclusively through LabCorp. This blood test

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28,

is designed to detect actionable mutations in non-small cell lung cancer genes to help guide patient care
decisions. We're also collaborating with HealthEC on the development of an oncology care module that will
help oncologists improve patient outcomes and achieve cost savings by making it easier for clinicians to
assess and compare key data points and performance metrics.

Also to support our priorities, we have made several business development activities. We expanded our
capabilities in hybrid and virtual trials by completing the acquisition of GlobalCare Clinical Trials. They are
a recognized industry leader that provides decentralized and traditional clinical trial study services in more
than 65 countries. Their therapeutic and operational expertise complements our clinical capabilities and
will expand our ability to provide decentralized trial services.

We also acquired RDL Reference Laboratory in June, a pioneer and leader for more than 40 years in
rheumatologic and autoimmune testing, strengthening LabCorp's full range of testing services for complex
autoimmune syndromes, which is important for rheumatologists, hospitals, health systems and biopharma
companies.

And lastly, we acquired the ambulatory testing business and entered into a comprehensive laboratory
services relationship with Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System, one of the largest health
systems serving Louisiana and Mississippi.

Though we cannot fully predict the future, we have confidence in our base business and in our ability
to continue to aggressively scale COVID-19 testing. I am optimistic about the future, and I want to
reaffirm that we are well positioned to continue to have a very significant impact to serve our customers
and to drive long-term shareholder value. We will continue to do all that we can to win the fight against
COVID-19.

A holistic approach, inclusive of society's adoption of wearing masks, social distancing and good hygiene
practices is crucial. Testing and effective tracking and tracing are very important. And we need new
treatments until a vaccine is widely and globally available. I am absolutely confident that it can be done
and that science will lead the way.

Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn to give more specifics on our financial performance.

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed
by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with some commentary regarding
our current expectations for the remainder of 2020. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we were able to
estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our results, given that the impact was late in the quarter. However,
we commented that we would not be able to do that going forward. For second quarter results, we have
quantified the revenue associated with the COVID-19 molecular and serology tests so that you can see the
change in the base business.

Now I'll review our second quarter performance. Revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, a decrease
of 3.9% compared to last year due to lower organic revenue of 5.4% and foreign currency translation
of 10 basis points, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions net of divestitures of 1.6%. The decline
in organic revenue was driven by the pandemic, which caused our organic base business to decline by
20.9%, which was partially offset by COVID-19 testing of 15.4%.

Operating income for the quarter was $298 million or 10.8% of revenue. We had $23 million of
restructuring charges and special items, primarily due to COVID-19-related costs and LaunchPad
initiatives, which was partially offset by an insurance reimbursement. Adjusted operating income, which
excludes amortization of $60 million as well as restructuring charges and special items, was $381 million
or 13.8% of revenue compared to $447 million or 15.5% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating
income and margin was primarily due to the decline in our base business as a result of the pandemic
and higher personnel costs, which was partially offset by COVID-19 testing and LaunchPad savings. The
decline in the base business includes the negative impact from PAMA of $14 million or 40 basis points.

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28,
2020

The tax rate for the quarter was 22%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding special charges and amortization,
was 23.9% compared to 25.2% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic
mix of earnings.

Net earnings for the quarter were $232 million or $2.37 per diluted share, which includes the monies from
the CARES Act of $56 million or $0.42 per share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring
charges, the CARES Act and other special items, were $2.57 in the quarter, down 12% compared to last
year.

Operating cash flow was $371 million in the quarter compared to $254 million a year ago. The increase in
operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings being partially offset by higher working capital. Cash
earnings benefited from the CARES Act and from tax deferrals, while the increase in working capital was
primarily due to COVID-19-related supplies and receivables.

Capital expenditures totaled $99 million in the quarter or 3.6% of revenue compared to $85 million or
3% last year. The increase in capital was due to $20 million of investments in adding COVID-19 testing
capacity. As a result, free cash flow was $272 million in the quarter compared to $168 million last year.

During the quarter, we invested $11 million in the Diagnostics acquisition. And as Adam mentioned, we
closed 2 additional tuck-in acquisitions in July, one for each segment. At quarter end, our cash balance
was $557 million, up from $324 million at the end of the first quarter. And total debt at quarter end was
$6.2 billion, and our leverage was 3.3x gross debt to last 12 months EBITDA.

Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter
was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 3.9% compared to last year due to a decline in organic revenue of 4.9%
and foreign currency translation of 10 basis points, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions of 1.1%.
The decline in organic revenue was driven by the pandemic which caused the base business to decline by
30.1%, which was partially offset by COVID-19 testing of 25.2%. Included in the base business decline
was the negative impact from PAMA of 0.8% and the nonrenewal of the BeaconLBS-UnitedHealthcare
contract of 1.2%.

The 3.9% decline in revenue was comprised of volume decline of 19.5%, partially offset by favorable
price/mix of 15.6%. The total volume decline of 19.5% from last year was due to organic volume declining
20.7%, which was partially offset by acquisitions contributing 1.2%. The decline in organic volume was
due to the pandemic, which drove our base business volumes to decline by 35.3%, partially offset by
increased COVID-19 testing volumes of 14.6%.

Throughout the quarter, both our organic base business as well as COVID-19 testing continue to improve.
For June, organic volume per day increased approximately 6% over the prior year, as the decline in
the base business of 17% was more than offset by COVID-19 testing of approximately 23%. As a
reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added
approximately 0.7% to the quarter's growth.

While total volume was down 19.5%, price/mix increased by 15.6%. The increase was driven by
COVID-19 testing of 10.7% and the change in the mix in the business of 5.2%, partially offset by currency
and acquisitions. The base business includes the negative impacts from PAMA of 0.8% and the nonrenewal
of the BeaconLBS contract of 1.2%.

LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $309 million or 18.2% of revenue
compared to $345 million or 19.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was
primarily due to the decline in our base business as a result of the pandemic as well as higher personnel
costs due to merit increases, partially offset by COVID-19 testing and LaunchPad savings. The decline in
the base business includes the negative impact from PAMA of $14 million or 60 basis points. We remain on
track to deliver $200 million of net savings by the end of 2021 from Diagnostics LaunchPad initiative.

Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion,
a decrease of 2.9% compared to last year due to a decline in organic revenue of 5.2% and foreign
currency translation of 10 basis points, partially offset by the benefit of acquisitions net of divestitures
of 2.4%. The organic revenue decline was due to the pandemic, which negatively impacted our base

2020

business, partially offset by COVID-19 testing which added 1.1% to revenue. Excluding our best estimate
of the impact of COVID-19, organic revenue would have grown in the mid- to high single-digits, in line
with our targeted performance.

Adjusted operating income for the segment was $113 million or 10.3% of revenue compared to $142
million or 12.6% last year. The decline in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to the
negative impact from the pandemic and higher personnel costs, partially offset by COVID-19 testing and
LaunchPad savings. We remain on track to deliver $150 million of net savings by the end of this year from
Drug Development's LaunchPad initiative.

For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $6.1 billion and 1.32,
respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $11.8 billion, an increase of approximately $490
million from last quarter. We expect approximately $4 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over
the next 12 months.

Now I'll provide some commentary regarding our current expectation for the remainder of 2020. Despite
our improved outlook, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the duration and future impact from
the pandemic. As a result, we continue to not provide 2020 guidance. However, we do expect for the
full year to see increased revenue, earnings and cash flow compared to last year, driven by COVID-19
testing demand. In addition, our current outlook assumes improvement in the base business of both our
Diagnostics and Drug Development businesses.

From the very beginning of the crisis, we have been focused on doing everything we can to address the
pandemic, such as increasing COVID-19 testing capacity as quickly as possible, irrespective of demand.
This has helped position us to perform approximately 180,000 molecular COVID-19 tests per day, and we
continue to add capacity subject to supplier availability.

During the first quarter, we commented that given the decline in our business as a result of the pandemic
as well as the uncertainty in our outlook, we took actions such as furloughs, reduced hours and withheld
merit increases and 401(k) contributions. Now with increased demand and an improved outlook, we
have brought back employees from furloughs, we are proceeding with merit adjustments, and we will
retroactively reinstate 401(k) contributions, recognizing the significant contributions of our employees.

From a capital allocation standpoint, our current outlook is that we will continue the suspension of our
share repurchase program but expect to do tuck-in acquisitions across both businesses that meet our
heightened threshold of strategic fit and financial returns.
This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll now take questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird.

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Quick question on Covance. I'm just curious if you could give us some -- since on the nature of the strong
bookings, particularly how much might be related to COVID-specific work? And maybe as a follow-on to
that, if you could give us any details on the performance of the 3 segments: clinical, central lab and early
development, how those individually played out during the quarter?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Eric, so Covance had a very good quarter. And I think it continues to show the power of having both
Diagnostics and Drug Development together. If you look, we had put together a enterprise early response
team. And that team includes people from both our Diagnostics business and our scientists from
Diagnostics together with people and scientists from Drug Development. And we've been participating in
discussions on almost every vaccine and almost every treatment for COVID-19.

With that said, as I mentioned in my script, most of those trials are still pretty early stage. So for the
quarter, they didn't necessarily contribute a very significant amount of dollars. As we move forward, I
believe that it will be increasingly important in terms of our revenue.

If you look at the 3 parts of our business, early development and central laboratories began to come
back quicker than the clinical work. And that's because if, for example, we have a central lab in China, as
China opened up, we saw the capacity fill pretty fast. And as markets open, where we have the central
laboratories, we've seen those countries continue to increase with the capacity that we have quickly.

Early development, we continue to do very well, and that includes some of the early work that I just
mentioned for COVID-19.

Clinical, we have seen an increase in accessibility of sites, and that's gone up fairly significantly,
particularly driven by Asia. Although there's not as many sites in Asia as there are in the U.S. and Europe,
most of the sites in Asia are now accessible. However, many companies are still waiting until there's global
accessibility before starting some of those particularly later stage Phase III trials, and I think that's still
going to take some time. So that business coming back has taken longer than the other 2.

Eric White Coldwell
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Adam, the -- your peers that have reported to date have talked about COVID awards comprising
somewhere between, call it, high teens and even mid-20s of total bookings. Could you share with us your
experience?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So I'm not going to give the exact percent because the book-to-bill, as you can imagine, it moves
based upon what makes it through Phase I, into Phase II and so forth, but we're not that dependent
on COVID-19 trials at the moment. So I can't compare it to their numbers, but our numbers are not as
dependent upon COVID.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research.

LABORATORY CORPORATION OF AMERICA HOLDINGS FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28,
2020

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

Adam, I was hoping to get your perspective as to how you think testing for COVID-19 is going to evolve
as we head into the fall. What portion of the testing do you think is going to move to pooled methods? Do
you think molecular is going to remain the go-to approach? And just any perspectives on antigen testing
would be great.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Absolutely, Jack. So the first thing I'd say, it's been pretty remarkable how in early March, we were doing
2,000 to 3,000 PCR tests per week. And here we are in the end of July, and we're able to do 180,000 PCR
tests per day. I mean, that's just astonishing. And for people that understand the type of equipment that
you need to run PCR tests, it's completely different than what you would need for blood tests. And we've
had to build significant capacity.

I believe that we have to continue to build capacity. We don't know for certain what the fall will bring.
But as schools open up, as businesses open up and as the fall flu season comes to fruition, I think we're
going to continue to need more testing. And I do believe that PCR testing will remain the gold standard for
telling if somebody currently has the disease. And therefore, we will continue to build capacity as fast as
we can and overcome some of the issues that we face in terms of supplies and machinery.

At the same time, I think that all testing is going to play a role. Pool testing is particularly helpful in areas
with low prevalence, in things like back to school or back to work because with low prevalence, you can
do the pool testing and then you don't have to do any re-testing. I don't think it's going to be the most
significant amount of testing that we're doing. In fact, I believe that the standard PCR testing in the
fall will remain the most significant by far of the testing that we do for PCR, but I do think that the pool
testing will add to our capacity and give us additional capabilities.

Things like antigen testing, I think, have a role also. So for example, if you wanted to test a large group
of people with antigen testing point-of-care, get quick answers, you could then see if there's any positive
people in that large group. If there are, I would go back and test them with PCR testing. If there's none,
I would probably feel pretty comfortable that I don't have to retest. The issue with the antigen testing as
it is today is that you can miss some positives. So you want to make sure if you have somebody positive,
you test the people that tested negative. But if it's a pretty large population, it would be a statistical
anomaly for everybody to test falsely negative. So if you see one positive in that population, I would go
back and retest them with PCR.

So I think we're going to need all the capacity we could get to get through the fall, assuming that the flu
season could be big, and we're all doing the best we can to prepare for it.

Jack Meehan
Nephron Research LLC

Great. And maybe just building off that, given some of the expectations around testing in the second half,
how are the incremental margins on the COVID testing stacking up versus the base business? And what's
your philosophy on reinvesting a portion of that back into the business?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So I'll give you a broad statement, and then I'll ask Glenn to give you some specifics. But we're going
to continue to build capacity irrespective of cost. And that's been our philosophy from the beginning,
buy as many machines as you can, get as much testing equipment as you can. And frankly, that's what
got us to 180,000 per day, along with our scientific capabilities. The LabCorp scientists have just been
extraordinary to get us to where we are today. And I want to continue to build that.

It will be a good day if we get to fall, and we have more capacity than the number of samples that we
get in. And that's what we're going to strive for albeit it's not going to be easy. We need help from our

suppliers who are working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to try to get more reagent, more machines and
so forth. But in terms of the margins, I'll let Glenn give you some specifics.

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Sure, Jack. We've commented in the past that when we -- obviously, given the fixed cost nature of the
Diagnostics business, the incremental drop down for new testing, call it, was around 65%. So we've
used that example when there's been weather and what's happened. So the COVID testing clearly falls
within the ballpark, if you will, of what we would experience with our other testing. So obviously, helping
contribute to the improved leverage, if you will, with the additional testing that we're doing.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research.

Stephen C. Baxter
Wolfe Research, LLC

I wanted to follow-up on the pooling for molecular testing. So my understanding is you'll initially be doing
this on your LTV. I guess how much of your daily volume today runs through the LTV? And what do you
think is the multiplier effect that you'll get on that capacity?

And then just as a follow up, what's the process for expanding pooling onto your other testing platforms?
And when would you expect to see that occur?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thank you, Stephen. The first thing I'd say is that we launched back in March with our LDT, and that's
a laboratory developed test by LabCorp scientists. And it's been remarkable, the amount of volume that
we've been able to do through that LDT. Of course, we still need our suppliers and the other companies to
help us to get to 180,000. But I have to say that our scientists did an extraordinary job with the LDT to
get us to 180,000 today.

I'm not going to give you the exact number through the LDT because that changes. It changes based upon
-- we have 16 labs running tests. Different labs have the LDT. Different labs have other equipment. So at
the end of the day, it depends on where the samples are, which tests we run them, and what we try to do
is optimize our network so we can get the best possible turnaround we can. To be at 2 to 3 days right now
of turnaround for our patients and the hospital inpatients even faster says that we found a real way to use
our capacity and distribute it successfully.

With regard to the pooled test, I don't think that we want to give a certain percent that we'll go through
that. Instead, what I would say is we're going to make sure that as much of our LDT, that is a significant
amount of our volume, it's a significant amount, and go through that if we need it.

At the same time, we'll have to file EUAs to use other platforms to run the pooled analysis on. And we
would expect to do that as we move forward. But for now, I think with our LDT, we can do as much pooling
as what we would seen appropriate.

Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.

Lisa Christine Gill
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Adam, I want to go back just to the core volumes. Can you give us any color as to what you've seen thus

And then secondly, I know you're not giving guidance, but just curious around your continued expectation
on the reimbursement side for COVID testing.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Sure, Lisa. And it was interesting because in the first quarter, when we saw the volume dropped by 55% in
the month of March, we didn't know how fast it would come back. And it was concern that it could take an
extended period of time. To be frank with you, I've been surprised at how fast it has come back. As states
have opened, we've seen the testing come back more significantly.

For example, as Florida and Texas and Georgia opened up first, we saw the core testing come back faster.
As states begin to modulate and slow down a little bit, you see the testing slow down. So there's definitely
a correlation between how far and how fast the states have opened to how far and how fast our base
business had come back. What I would say is for June, it was the first time since COVID that we saw that
the total testing, including our COVID testing, was above prior year.

In July, it's still early. We don't have all the data for the month, but we're seeing continued strength in the
base business and base testing. The reason that we have not given guidance for the rest of the year is
because, as you say, it's impossible to know how fast things will move, will they slow down a little bit if
they see additional breakout? What will the fall look like? What could happen? Will it be another slowdown
in the base business? So we're watching it, I mean, frankly, almost every day, but we want to make sure
that we continue to do the best we can to be able to forecast that.

In terms of reimbursement, they did announce, HHS, that they extended the emergency in the United
States. Typically, that lasts for another 90 days. We assume that the reimbursement will continue to be
strong as we go through the emergency situation, and then we'll just have to see what happens as we go
after that 90-day extension.

Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So hoping you could elaborate further on what you're seeing from the return-to-work demand front.
Adam, you mentioned you're connected with hundreds of employers, but I'd love to be able to quantify
that or better understand the magnitude in some fashion.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Sure, Dan. The first thing I would say is that I spent a lot of time talking to other CEOs, talking to
presidents of universities, and we try to help them understand ways that they can think about going
back to work or back to school. And different companies and universities are thinking about different
approaches. And sometimes, it depends on if they're in a hotspot, if they're in an area with very low
prevalence, what type of workforce they have, do they have health care workers, do they have factory
workers. So a lot of things go into the discussion, and it's a multi-variant discussion.

In general, the first thing that we talk about is the importance of wearing masks, social distancing,
ensuring the workplace is clean, good hygiene, cleaning elevators and elevator buttons, ensuring the
airflow in the buildings are appropriate. Prevention and keeping people out of work that are sick, having
temperature checks before they come into school or work questionnaires, that's all critical.

The second thing is that once somebody does make it into school or workplace and has any symptoms,
you want to test them with PCR as quickly as possible, and you want to have tracking and tracing
capabilities and be able to track and trace anybody that's been around them. And then you want to have a
place to isolate them, particularly if you're in a university, while you wait for the results to come back. And
that's why having the type of turnaround that we do, 2 to 3 days, is so important for tracking and tracing.

And then ultimately, over time, we want to work with them to get flu vaccinations for their workforce,
so that when they get to the fall flu season, they'll have a sense as to what is flu versus what might be
COVID-19. So we're trying to work with these companies across the entire front of what they can be
thinking about as they go into the August, September time frame.

What I can say is a lot of my time is spent on talking them out of doing testing because the types of
testing people have said is, well, why don't I test everybody once a week? I don't think that makes a lot
of sense to do that. I think if they want to do surveillance, that's fine. But to try to test everybody once a
week, that will give you one point in time. And the next day, if somebody, in seconds, starts to spread it,
you won't necessarily have done a lot. You've spent a lot of money on testing that probably was not best
use of your time and money.

So to be honest with you, I spent a lot of time trying to help them think about it logically. And a lot of my
time is trying to make them understand how to best use testing and where it's appropriate. And I can tell
you, I'm spending a lot of my time, and my team is spending a lot of time talking to these folks.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I appreciate all that color. And then for my follow-up, Adam, you commented earlier about the differential
trends at Covance by line of business. Can you also comment by customer segment between large
pharma, maybe midsized pharma and what you're seeing out of the emerging biotech crowd that's been
pretty successful raising money to date?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. I would say we're seeing increases, and we're seeing business across all: biopharma, pharma, large,
small, U.S., ex U.S. But it's in the lines of business, like I mentioned to you earlier, that we're seeing the
business come back faster in early development, central laboratories. And over time, I believe we'll see
more in the clinical area. But I don't think there's a differentiation and segmentation across the customers
within those segments. We're seeing strength, frankly, and RFPs across them all.

Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker from KeyBanc.

Donald Houghton Hooker
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I was curious, you guys took a receivable reserve, I think, last quarter, given the potential for cash
collection issues, obviously, with more unemployment. How has that played out? And how is -- I know you
guys have invested a lot in technologies in that area as well to mitigate that. Can you maybe elaborate on
your experience there?

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Don, it's Glenn. Yes. As you mentioned, in the first quarter, given the pandemic coming and looking back
at other times where we've seen significant financial disruption and how it impacted our client base,
we established a reserve of $17 million. We have seen an increase in our bad debt experience, but we
feel that the reserves that we have established are very adequate going forward and nothing that was
unexpected, at least at this time.

Donald Houghton Hooker

Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from DB.

Justin D. Bowers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

This is Justin Bowers on for Pito. Just with respect to pooling, are you -- is the plan to roll that out to all of
the 19 sites?

And then secondarily, when we do some quick math on the multiplier effect, we arrive, let's say, 300,000
to 350,000 like a theoretical capacity. But just based on your earlier comments, it sounds like molecular
is going to be the primary modality. So can you help us think about kind of the ramp there? Or what the
capacity is with pooling? And then -- and I'll stop there.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thank you for the question, Justin. And pooling is important piece, but it's not, in my opinion, going
to be the primary piece. PCR testing will continue to be the primary piece of what we do. And if you look
at our labs, we will not be rolling out pooling to all of our labs. It takes a lot of technical capabilities to do
the analysis, the analytics to hold the samples, where you test the samples, is a lot of work and you need
some specialized equipment from it. So we'll have it in multiple laboratories, but certainly not across all
laboratories.

And then we have to make sure we use it in the right patient population. So we're not going to just
broadly start trying to pool patients. We're going to look for the right places and the right parts of the
country or the right organizations where we believe the prevalence will be such that pooling makes sense.

What I would avoid is trying to go to theoretical capacity. And for example, right now, we can do 180,000
tests per day. We have done in a day 180,000 tests, so we know we can. But I would not take 180,000
and times it by 7 and try to figure out capacity. Because if you can do 180,000, but you want to maintain
a 1- to 2-day or 2- to 3-day turnaround, you don't want to run at full capacity. You want to be below that.
So we're going to continue to ensure that we do as many tests as we can, but we want to manage the
turnaround time as best we can as well. So to me, theoretical capacity is just that, but that's not how I
build our financial model. I build it based upon practical utilization of the test, of which pooling will be a
part of, but the overall PCR testing will drive it.

Justin D. Bowers
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Appreciate it. And just a quick follow-up. In terms of the base business, when you look at some of the
areas where some of the hotspots around the country now, how is the base business trending versus like
earlier in the pandemic? And just trying to get a sense of like the magnitudes and the swings because I
would think it's not as severe as it was, let's say, in April.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So it's bounced back pretty significantly. And what we've seen is as states have begun to open up,
the base testing has increased. And for the first time, if you look at our base testing plus our COVID-19
testing in June, we actually had volume that was above the prior year. So that just gives you a sense that
the base business came back pretty well.

Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Adam, you talked and mentioned the flu a few times during the call. Just hoping to get a little bit of a
sense of what you're expecting for the flu season, how it plays out, just given the current backdrop, and
what are your testing capabilities to sort of do both one shot? And then practically speaking, can you just
give us a sense of how big flu testing is for you? And again, whether you think there's an uptick there.

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thank you, Ralph. And what I would say is if you look at this pandemic, the only thing that has been
predictable is the fact that it's been unpredictable. And what we want to do is build as much capacity as
fast as we can for any circumstance that comes at us come the fall flu season. When you look at the flu
season, we think that this will probably be one of the highest years for people to get flu vaccinations. And
we hope as many people that are able and that it's appropriate for to get those vaccinations could do it.

Our LabCorp Employer Services are actually helping businesses get vaccinations for flu for their
employees. It's going to depend on the flu season, the strain, how effective those vaccines are. As you
know, every year, there's a different efficacy of the flu vaccine. So we'll see how that plays out based upon
the strains. But under all circumstances, I think that COVID-19, together with the flu season, is going to
be more problematic than where we are today.

We are developing combined tests with multiple respiratory elements, including things like flu and
COVID-19. Flu has not been a very significant driver of revenue for us in the past. But I think with
COVID-19, it's going to continue to be important to know, is it flu or is it COVID-19? If somebody does a
rapid flu test in a physician's office and he comes back negative and they saw symptoms, they're going
to probably want to get the PCR test. If somebody comes back positive for flu in the office, I'd feel good
about that, but I would still want to validate it in case it was a point-of-care false positive and get the PCR
test. So that's why I believe, under almost every circumstance, we've got to be prepared to do everything
we can to build as much capacity for the flu season.

Ralph Giacobbe
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. I want to go to the pricing number ex COVID. So just
the base, I think it was up almost 7% ex PAMA and Beacon. Is that just all acuity-driven? Or what are the
factors? And maybe what's a more sustainable number as we think looking ahead?

Glenn A. Eisenberg
CFO & Executive VP

Hey Ralph, it's Glenn. That's right. The mix impact on the base business was up with 5.2% but negatively
impacted the 2% between PAMA and BeaconLBS, so call it around 7%. Again, you'll notice that this time,
we've used the price/mix to help define the revenue, so volume and price/mix to get to our change in
revenues. We have changed the methodology, as you would have seen in the past using revenue per
requisition, given that in the past, that was always a good proxy, if you will, for our pricing or our mix
within the business. And what was interesting this quarter is we're trying to explain our, call it, 3.9%
reduction in revenue. If you took our volume change and our revenue per requisition change, you would
get to minus [ 0.1 ]. So this is really the first quarter that there's been a change, and that just due to the
dramatic decline in volumes that we've experienced.

So the rev rec number, if you will, within the base, would have been around, well, 19.4%. So the pricing
overall within the base business, we always talk about it being that from a unit price is relatively stable. So
normally, where we see the change is normally in favorable mix. It could be test per session. It could be
acquisition-related, but most of it driven off of test mix or potentially some payer mix as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just a couple of questions here. The first one on serology. So Adam, maybe you can share your thoughts.
What do you think serology testing guidelines could look like when the vaccine is available?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Ricky, the first thing I would say is that we've built capacity in serology to a very significant degree. We
can do 300,000 tests a day. We can do the total antibodies. We can look at the IgG, IgM, IgA. And I
think that we've done a really good job to get that up and running. There's really still information and
science that we need to understand what those antibodies mean. So we need to understand if you have
the antibodies, are you immune? If you're immune, for how long does that last? If you have the antibodies
and they start to wane over time, will your T-cells kick in if you're exposed to virus again and you have an
immune response?

So I would say that there's still more science that needs to be out there before we can give a definitive
answer as to what they mean. But at a minimum, I would want to know if I had COVID-19 in the past
because I want to know that I beat it. So if I had the antibodies, I would know that I had COVID-19 in the
past, and I beat it.

Number two, as you start to think about plasma and convalescent blood plasma and collecting that, you're
going to want to know that people have antibodies in the plasma so that if that works as a treatment, we
can get plasma from as many people as possible. I think antibody testing is going to be important for that.

Ultimately, I think you're going to need quantitative antibody testing that would say what level of
antibodies do you have, and I think that's going to be important. And we have a quantitative antibody
test as well as a qualitative antibody test. So at the end of the day, we're at the forefront of science on
antibodies, on understanding T-cells and other immune responses, but we still need more science and
more research to give us the definitive answers.

Rivka Regina Goldwasser
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then on the PCR side, I mean, to your point, you said we have 180,000 capacity, but practical
utilization is below that. So when you think about current demand levels, to achieve that 1 to 2 days ideal
turnaround, what does of -- where does capacity need to be?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. So Ricky, that's a big question. And as you go into the fall, I can't tell you the answer to that because
we don't know what the demand is going to be. And that's why we are building as much capacity as
fast as we can. I have no constraints on buying machines and buying reagents. We're working with our
suppliers who have been just terrific to work with to build whatever we need. And it will be a good day if
we get through the fall and said we had more capacity than what we needed.

With regard to where we are today at 180,000, we're already at -- for hospitalized patients, we're at about
a day, 1.5 days turnaround. And then for everybody else, we're already right now, as we speak, at a 2-
to 3-day turnaround. So we're doing really well in terms of turnaround, but we've got to keep building
because we don't know what the volume is going to be in the fall, and we won't rest until we build and
build and build as much as we can.

And just one follow-up. When you think about the volumes, what percent of the volumes are hospital
versus the rest on the COVID side?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. The hospital is small volume. And over time, it will get smaller as there's more point-of-care tests
available, as there's more cartridges for a point-of-care test available. I think the hospitals will try to use
those as much as possible. So -- and we do some point-of-care tests in our TSAs, which are the hospital
labs that we manage. So for me, hospital inpatients' point-of-care is critical. Right now, we have a great
turnaround. We're doing that as fast as we can for them. But if I was running a hospital and I can get an
answer even faster, I want it even faster. So it will be a smaller percent as we go towards the future.

Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So I've got a I got a couple of questions on the lab. So your competitor put out a low end of their fourth
quarter guidance that basically implied a slowdown in the like of your testing. I'm just wondering your sort
of thoughts on that scenario happening. Is that even something that's remotely possible?

And then some commentary on what you're hearing from the commercial payers in terms of how they're
reimbursing.

And then finally, have you looked at next-generation sequencing as a way of increasing capacity? Is that
something that you would potentially consider?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thanks, Derik. So what I would say is the reason that we have not provided guidance is because
there is still so many unknowns as we go into the second half of the year. And the unknowns aren't just
with PCR testing. It's also with the base business. Right now, the base business has come back very well.
Will it remain that way, particularly if we have another significant COVID-19 impact in the fall? It's hard to
know.

I believe that COVID-19 testing, until there's a vaccine, they're going to need us to do as many as we
can possibly do. And that's why we're going to build that capacity as quickly as we can. So I don't see
a scenario except if there's a vaccine or some type of technology that I don't know of today that would
impact us, that would say we don't need a lot of PCR testing going throughout this year.

In terms of next-generation sequencing, absolutely, we're going to look at everything. The question is
at what cost and at what price point and how accurate will it be versus the PCR testing. And that kind of
leads to your second question, which I put third, because I think commercial payers are going to look, if
they can get a very quick turnaround for an accurate test at a reasonable cost, they would do that versus
other tests, unless there's a real scientific reason to do otherwise. So what I can tell you, our scientists are
looking at every technology available. Every time I read about one or I see one, I send it to our scientists.
And they said, "Yes, we've already talked to them. We've already looked at it." So we'll be at the forefront
of science and technology here. If there's something that makes sense, we're going to look at it. We're
going to do everything we can to be a part of it, just like we've done already with things like PacBio and
Adaptive and so forth. But as I sit here today, I think PCR testing, as we go into the fall is going to be
critical, and that's why we are so focused on trying to build capacity.

This is Dan Lawler on for Matt Larew. I wanted to ask about the demand for COVID test on the Pixel
platform. Can you give us a sense for what share of your COVID tests have been through the platform?
And then how meaningful Pixel self-collection might be from a back-to-school or return-to-work
perspective?

Adam H. Schechter
President, CEO & Chairman

Yes. Thank you, Dan. So Pixel continues to be an important part and one of the many offerings that we
have for people to get PCR testing. It is not a significant, meaning, not more than 25% of our volume,
it's less than that. But we do see the Pixel volume increasing. And I do believe that as people go back to
school or back to work, at-home collection kits will become more important. And that's why we have Pixel,
but we also have other at-home collection kits outside of Pixel that we will use for bulk mailings and for
things like employers. So I do believe it will become a more important piece of our mix, even though we're
moving a lot of them today, there'll be more as we go into the future.

Okay. Yes. So in close, our mission to improve health and improve lives demands that we stay at the
forefront in the fight against COVID-19. The importance and the urgency of what we do has never been
more clear. And our commitment and our ability to support important scientific advances are wavering,
and we will only continue to strengthen it as we move into the future. So I want to thank everyone
