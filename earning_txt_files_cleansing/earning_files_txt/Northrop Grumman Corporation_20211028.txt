Presentation

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2021 Conference
Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Catherine, and I will be your operator today. [Operator
Instructions]

I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor
Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.

Todd B. Ernst
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Catherine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2021
Conference Call. We'll refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on the IR web page.

Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including 2021 guidance and beyond, reflect the
company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-
looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings.
These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.

Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our
earnings release.

On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this
time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another quarter of
strong results in an increasingly complex environment. In the last quarter, we've seen developments in
the global fight against COVID-19 and macroeconomic changes, such as a tightening labor market, supply
chain challenges and growing inflation. But we've also seen evolving threats to our National Security,
which has further eliminated the value of Northrop Grumman products and services.

On today's call, we will provide insights into these developments and their effects on our business to date
as well as discuss our third quarter performance results and provide our updated outlook for this year and
an additional look at 2022.

I'd like to thank our employees and our extended Northrop Grumman team, including our suppliers, for
their relentless focus on delivering for our customers and our shareholders. I am proud of how our team
has demonstrated remarkable resiliency and adaptability during these dynamic times.

Our company continues to deliver strong operating performance. As we announced earlier today, we had
a segment operating margin rate of 11.9% in the third quarter, and year-to-date, an exceptional segment
operating margin rate of 12%. In addition, earnings per share in the quarter were $6.63, an increase of
13% compared to last year. And our transaction-adjusted free cash generation continues to be strong,
increasing 15% year-to-date. We ended the quarter with just over $4 billion in cash, providing significant
flexibility in support of our capital deployment initiatives.

With respect to the top line, our year-to-date organic growth was 8%. This robust growth reflects the
alignment and strength of our broad portfolio to our customers' priorities and future needs. As expected,
our organic growth rate slowed in the quarter from the rapid pace that we saw in the first half of the year.

In addition to having fewer working days in the second half of the year, which we discussed on each of
our last 2 calls, we are also seeing an impact on our sales from the broader economic environment due to

COVID-19. During the third quarter, this included employee leave taking at a higher level than planned,
a tighter labor market and certain supply chain challenges. We continue to focus on the safety and well-
being of our employees, customers and partners as we work to mitigate the impact of these factors.

As you know, the President recently issued an executive order generally requiring employees to federal
contractors to be fully vaccinated by early December. We have shared the details of this mandate with our
U.S. workforce, and we are working to help them meet the requirements. We also increased our hiring
plans for the fourth quarter to help mitigate the potential impact of any increased attrition.

Based on the team's strong third quarter performance and in consideration of macroeconomic factors as
we see them today, we are increasing our guidance for segment OM and EPS for the year and narrowing
our sales guidance to approximately $36 billion. Dave will provide more details on the quarter, our updated
guide as well as our initial outlook for 2022.

Turning to budget updates from Washington. We're seeing strong bipartisan support for National Security
broadly and Northrop Grumman programs specifically. We are pleased that an agreement was reached
on the continuing resolution and debt ceiling that will fund the government through December 3. We are
hopeful that Congress will finalize the fiscal year 2022 appropriations and avoid a protracted continuing
resolution.

With respect to the FY '22 defense budget overall, we see bipartisan support for increased defense
spending, including adding funding above the President's budget request. We are hopeful that this
additional funding will be supported in final appropriations.

Over the past several weeks, senior customers, members of Congress and administration officials have
made increasingly public comments about strategic competition in the National Security environment and
the need to counter and deter evolving threats. One clear and consistent message has been the need to
invest in and more rapidly field advanced capabilities.

Our company's portfolio and capabilities are strongly aligned to the 5 National Security priority areas,
particularly in advanced weapons, strategic deterrence, mission systems and space. And we're using
digital technologies to develop and deploy capabilities faster and more efficiently than ever before across
our entire portfolio.

I'll share a few highlights to demonstrate how our performance today continues to position us for the
future. With the emergence of more sophisticated air defense systems, the need for standoff capabilities
and speed to target is critical for our customers. To address this requirement, Northrop Grumman
developed AARGM-ER, a high-speed, long-range air-to-ground missile. And in the third quarter, after just
28 months in engineering, manufacturing and development, we achieved a critical milestone, clearing the
wafer production. In September, we received our first low-rate initial production award for the program.

Also during the quarter, we, along with our industry partner, Raytheon, successfully tested the hypersonic
air-breathing weapon concept known in HAWC. Northrop Grumman supplies the scramjet propulsion
system for HAWC, allowing speeds of greater than Mach 5. AARGM-ER and HAWC are just 2 examples of
how we're providing the higher speed and longer-range weapons needed to be relevant in today's threat
environment.

Another key area where we are supporting our customers is in the need and urgency to enhance our
country's strategic deterrence capabilities, especially in light of recent disclosures of investments that
other nations are making in modernizing their strategic capabilities. The triad is the foundation of the
security strategy for the U.S. and its allies and has been an effective deterrent for decades, preserving
peace and deterring aggression. As highlighted by recent customer and administration comments,
modernizing the triad remains a high priority.

Northrop Grumman is the prime on 2 of the 3 legs of the triad with the bomber and strategic missiles,
and we're a significant supplier for submarines as well. For the bomber, the B-21 program continues to
advance. As Air Force Secretary, Frank Kendall recently noted, there are now 5 units in various stages of
production and the systems are, in his words, making good progress to real fielded capability.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

For strategic missiles, we continue to make solid progress on the EMD portion of the ground-based
strategic deterrent program. We completed key milestones earlier this year, and we are tracking toward
our first flight as planned. The GBSD program has ramped significantly this year, and we now expect that
it will add just over $1 billion in incremental revenue to our 2021 results and another approximately $500
million of incremental revenue in 2022.

For both B-21 and GBSD, we have applied digital transformation concept as a key enabler to reduce risk,
increase productivity, shorten cycle time and improve the system's ability to adapt to changing threats.

In today's rapidly changing threat environment, our Mission Systems portfolio, including in
communications and artificial intelligence, is making a critical contribution in the advancement of
technology and capability needed to allow legacy platforms to be more capable and survivable, and
therefore, more relevant toward addressing the increasingly sophisticated threats.

To this end, during the third quarter, our next-generation electronic warfare system, which will equip
domestic F-16, had its first test flight on a test bed aircraft at the Northern Lightning exercise. This
system, in conjunction with our SABR radar demonstrated full interoperability in a simulated contested
electromagnetic spectrum environment. With the radio frequency spectrum becoming increasingly
contested, this critical set of electronic warfare capabilities will allow the platform to remain survivable.
We anticipate an EMD contract for next-generation electronic warfare in 2022 with an overall lifetime
opportunity of up to $3 billion.

And in Missile Defense, emerging threats from hypersonic missiles are creating new challenges for
customers. We are helping to provide differentiated solutions to these challenges by applying our
advanced technology and domain expertise. Earlier this year, we were awarded a contract to deliver a
prototype satellite as part of MDA's hypersonic and ballistic tracking-based sensor, HBTSS, program. This
program is designed to detect and track hypersonic vehicles which have a very different flight profile and
signature than ballistic missiles. They required new sensing capabilities in order to detect and track them.
In September, we conducted a successful HBTSS critical design review and are progressing towards a 2023
launch.

In the space domain, Northrop Grumman is working with our customers on advanced capabilities to
address a range of new and evolving threats. Many of these programs are classified. And consistent with
increased demand in this area, we received $1.2 billion in restricted space awards in the third quarter.

I've touched on several major contributions that we've made this quarter to National Security, all of
which highlight our strong performance, technology leadership and broad portfolio. I also want to
share examples of our collaboration with partners to accelerate innovation and create discriminating
technologies.

As I've noted before, we are actively engaging in partnering with early-stage technology and
nontraditional defense companies. In the quarter, we closed an investment in Orbit Fab, a space logistics
company whose goal is to put gas stations in space. Their vision fits well with our on-orbit satellite
refueling and space logistics capabilities.

We also continue to work with Deepwave Digital, an innovative company we invested in at the end of last
year. Deepwave Digital provides a hardware and software solution, enabling very efficient AI-enhanced,
software-defined radios for deep learning applications at the edge, which we believe will enhance our
efforts in both autonomy and JADC2. These partnerships, as well as other venture investments, support
our strategy to create solutions at speed for our customers' toughest national security challenges.

Now I'll turn the call over to Dave, who will provide more detail on our third quarter results, our updated
2021 guidance and our 2022 outlook. Dave?

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Okay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments with third quarter highlights
on Slide 3. We continued to generate strong operating results, delivering another quarter of solid organic

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

sales growth, higher segment operating margin rate and outstanding earnings per share and transaction-
adjusted free cash flow. We continued to return cash to shareholders through our buyback program and
quarterly dividend, returning over $800 million in the quarter.

Slide 4 provides a bridge between third quarter 2020 and third quarter 2021 sales, excluding sales from
the IT services divestiture, our organic growth was 3%. This rate was below our first half growth due in
part to the broader labor market and supply chain trends that Kathy outlined.

Next, I'll review our earnings per share results on Slide 5. Compared to the third quarter of 2020, a
our EPS increased 13% to $6.63. Strong segment operational performance contributed about $0.14 of
growth and lower corporate unallocated added another $0.55. This included a $60 million benefit from
insurance settlements related to shareholder litigation involving the former Orbital ATK business prior
to our acquisition. Corporate unallocated expense also decreased due to a change in deferred state
income taxes as well as lower intangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation. Pension
costs contributed $0.17 of growth, driven by higher non-service FAS income. Our marketable securities
performance represented a headwind of $0.17 compared to the third quarter of 2020, which benefited
from particularly strong equity markets. Lastly, we experienced a slightly higher federal tax rate in the
period due to lower benefits from foreign-derived intangible income.

Turning to sector results on Slide 6. We saw some broad-based COVID-related impact. the most significant
of which were in our Aeronautics sector. Aeronautics sales declined 6% for the quarter. Year-to-date,
its sales are down 1%. As we've described in recent quarters, several programs in our AS portfolio are
plateauing or entering a phase of their life cycle where you would not expect to see growth. This quarter,
we experienced slightly lower volume across the portfolio, including restricted efforts, F-35, B-2 DMS and
Global Hawk programs. We expect this overall trend to continue at AS in 2022, which we'll discuss in more
detail momentarily.

At Defense Systems, sales decreased by 24% in the quarter and 22% year-to-date. On an organic basis,
sales were down roughly 2% in the quarter and year-to-date periods driven by the completion of our
activities on the Lake City small-caliber ammunition contract last year. Lake City represented a sales
headwind of roughly $75 million in the quarter and $335 million year-to-date. This was partially offset by
higher volume on several mission readiness programs.

Mission Systems sales were down 5% in the quarter and up 4% year-to-date. Organically, MS sales
increased 1% in Q3, and year-to-date, they are up a robust 9%. As we've noted previously, the timing of
material volume at MS has been weighted more towards the first half of 2021 than the second. Organic
sales growth in the third quarter and year-to-date periods was broad based across programs such as G/
ATOR, JCREW and various restricted efforts.

And finally, Space Systems continued to deliver outstanding sales growth, increasing 22% in the third
quarter and 28% year-to-date. Sales in both business areas were higher in the quarter and year-to-date
periods reflecting continued ramp-up on GBSD and NGI as well as higher volume on restricted programs
and Artemis.

Turning to segment operating income and margin rate on Slide 7. We delivered another quarter of
excellent performance with segment operating margin rate at 11.9%. Aeronautics third quarter operating
income decreased to 10% due to lower sales volume and a $42 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on
the F-35 program. The adjustment was driven by labor-related production inefficiencies, reflecting COVID-
related impacts on the program. The AS operating margin rate decreased to 9.7% in Q3 as a result of this
adjustment with year-to-date operating margin slightly ahead of last year at 10.1%.

The Defense Systems operating income decreased by 19% in the quarter and 16% year-to-date, largely
due to the impact of the IT services divestiture. Operating margin rate increased to 12.4% in the quarter
and 12% year-to-date, largely driven by improved performance and contract mix in Battle Management &
Missile Systems, partially offset by lower net favorable EAC adjustments.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

At Mission Systems, operating income was relatively flat in the quarter and up 10% year-to-date. Third
quarter operating margin rate improved to 15.3% and year-to-date was 15.5%, reflecting strong program
performance and changes in business mix as a result of the IT services divestiture.

Space Systems operating income rose 29% in the quarter and 36% year-to-date, driven by higher sales
volume. Operating margin rate was also higher at 10.7% in the quarter and 10.9% year-to-date, driven
by higher net favorable EAC adjustments.

Moving to sector guidance on Slide 8. Note that this outlook assumes a relatively consistent level of impact
in Q4 with what we've been experiencing so far this year from the effects of COVID on the workforce and
supply chain, and it does not include any potential financial impacts on the company related to the vaccine
mandate. We have updated our 2021 sales estimates for each segment based on our year-to-date results
and current expectations for Q4.

For operating margin rate, we're increasing our guidance at Defense and Space, and the margin rates at
AS and MS remain unchanged.

Before we get to our consolidated guidance, I'd also like to take a moment to discuss some of the factors
to consider in comparing our fourth quarter revenue to last year on Slide 9. In Q4 of 2020, the IT services
business contributed almost $600 million of sales and the equipment sale at AS generated over $400
million. Q4 of 2021 also has 4 fewer working days than the same period in 2020, representing a headwind
of about 6%. Adjusting for these 3 items, our Q4 2021 sales would grow at 3% to 4% based on our latest
full year guidance.

Moving to Slide 10. Based on what we now see, we expect sales of approximately $36 billion. We're raising
our 2021 outlook for segment and total operating margin and for EPS. Our segment operating margin
rate guidance is 10 basis points higher at 11.7% to 11.9%, reflecting our continued strong performance.
Our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment has increased $60 million for the full year as a result of the annual
demographic update we performed in Q3. Other corporate unallocated costs are $70 million below
our previous guidance, now at approximately $120 million for the year. As I mentioned, our corporate
unallocated costs benefited from a $60 million insurance settlement in Q3 as well as additional benefits
from state taxes. These updates translate into an increase of 50 basis points in our operating margin rate
to a range of 16% to 16.2% in our updated guidance.

Remember that the gain from the IT services divestiture in Q1 contributed approximately 5 percentage
points of overall operating margin benefit for the full year.

We continue to project the 2021 effective federal tax rate in the high 17% range, excluding the effects of
the divestiture, which is consistent with our prior guidance.

Lastly, we're raising our EPS guidance, which I'll cover on Slide 11. Segment performance is contributing
about $0.15 of the increase with the benefits to corporate unallocated and pension contributing the
remainder. In total, this represents an $0.80 improvement in our transaction-adjusted EPS guidance. With
this latest increase, our 2021 EPS guidance is up by about $2 since our initial guidance in the beginning of
the year.

Before we move to 2022, I wanted to give you an update on our cash performance. Year-to-date, we've
generated over $2.1 billion of transaction-adjusted free cash flow, up 15% compared to 2020, and we
ended the quarter with over $4 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Keep in mind that we have a roughly
$200 million payroll tax payment in Q4 from the Cares Act legislation with the second similar payment
in 2022. Additionally, we expect to pay the balance of our transaction-related tax from the IT services
divestiture in the fourth quarter. Our healthy cash position has enabled us to repurchase over $2.7 billion
of stock so far this year, on track with our full year target of $3 billion or more.

As we look ahead to 2022, on Slide 12, our outlook is based on the same set of assumptions that we
described for 2021 guidance regarding the COVID environment and vaccine mandate. It also assumes that
the continuing resolution does not extend beyond 2021. And like our 2021 guidance, it assumes that we
do not experience a breach of the debt ceiling. We expect Space to be our fastest-growing segment again

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

in 2022, driven by GBSD, NGI and several restricted efforts as they continue to ramp. Mission Systems
and Defense Systems should also produce organic growth.

Regarding Aeronautics Systems, after several years of strong growth, our latest 2021 sales guidance calls
for a mid-single-digit decline, and we see that trend continuing in 2022. We've talked in recent quarters
about the headwinds in our HALE portfolio. We're also projecting lower sales on JSTARS, F-18 as well
as our restricted portfolio. Looking further to the future, it's an exciting decade for defense aerospace.
Rapidly evolving threats are spurring a new wave of autonomous vehicle and sixth-generation fighter
development. So the opportunity set in AS remains solid, and we will continue to invest in the cutting-
edge technologies that allow our customers to stay ahead of the threat environment.

Altogether, we currently expect 2022 sales at the company level to reflect continued organic growth.
Looking at segment margin, we expect the strong results we've demonstrated in 2021 to continue in 2022
with excellent program performance offsetting a portion of the 20 to 30 basis point benefit we generated
from pension-related overhead rate changes in Q1 of 2021.

While we project higher sales and strong segment operating margin, we expect transaction-adjusted
earnings per share to be down next year as a result of several nonoperational headwinds. Lower CAS
pension recoveries and higher corporate unallocated expenses are currently projected to create an EPS
headwind next year of more than $2. For FAS pension, our outlook for 2022 will depend on our updated
actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and plan asset returns, which we will determine at the end
of the year. Earnings per share driven from sales growth, strong operating margin performance and lower
share count will help to offset these nonoperational items.

Next, I'd like to spend a moment discussing cash. We expect relatively stable cash flow at the program
level in 2022, but there are a few temporal items that should be factored into the year-over-year
comparison of overall free cash flow. First is lower CAS pension recoveries. As you can see on Slide 13,
our CAS recoveries are currently expected to be lower by $350 million next year. The second is cash taxes.
Excluding the impact of the IT services transaction, we expect cash taxes to be modestly higher next
year. In addition, as we've noted in the past, current tax law would require companies to amortize R&D
costs over 5 years, starting in 2022, which would increase our cash taxes by around $1 billion next year
and smaller amounts in subsequent years. There continues to be uncertainty in the tax environment with
potential new legislation that could change the R&D amortization provision and other provisions. We will
provide updates on each of these items on our January call.

Taking all of these cash flow factors into consideration, we would expect to decline in 2022 transaction-
adjusted free cash flow, followed by a double-digit growth CAGR through 2024, driven by strong
operational performance.

Regarding capital deployment, investing in the business through disciplined R&D and capital spending
continues to be our priority. We expect CapEx to be roughly flat next year in absolute dollar terms. We
believe these investments allow us to stay at the forefront of technology as we invest in our business. And
as we've said, we continue to expect to return the majority of our 2022 free cash flow to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Kathy.

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks, Dave. In summary, we have delivered excellent year-to-date results and operating performance,
and we are pleased to be increasing our full year EPS guidance for the third consecutive quarter. We are
actively engaged with our supply chain and our employees as we work to mitigate broader COVID-related
risks and continue to keep our programs on track.

As shown by the many milestones in the quarter, we have highly relevant capabilities and programs that
align well to National Security requirements and our customer funding priorities. So as we look forward,
2022 is expected to deliver another year of organic sales growth and excellent performance, paving the
way for longer-term margin expansion and free cash flow growth. We remain focused on protecting the

safety and well-being of our employees, delivering the capabilities our customers need to protect National
Security and sustain our planet and delivering value to our shareholders.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.

Robert Alan Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Kathy or Dave, just on the 2022 expectations for AS, your decline that you're expecting, I was wondering
if you could give a little bit more detail on the puts and takes and, obviously, you can't talk that much
about classified, but if you could give some sort of scale of the moving parts, that would be very helpful.

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure, Rob, it's Dave. I can touch on that a bit further. As we mentioned, we're projecting a mid-single-
digit growth decline this year in AS, and that's about the same trend that we anticipate next year in light
of where we are in the life cycle of a lot of our key programs in AS at this point. There's no single factor or
even 2 or 3 factors that contribute to the lion's share of that decline, but rather a fairly consistent trend in
the trajectory across a lot of our key programs in the sector.

You mentioned we can't say much about our restricted portfolio, certainly agreed on that front. We have
mentioned that the Global Hawk portfolio is projected to decline next year as Block 20s and 30s continue
in their retirement process. F-18 is projecting a decline for our portion of that program. JSTARS is another
I would highlight there. And so across the board, these are fairly consistent drivers. F-35, we've talked
about some of the COVID impacts there in Q3 And it's kind of pattern going forward in the AS portion of
the program is relatively flat to modestly declining as we look at the '22 outlook. So hopefully, that gives
you a sense of some of the key drivers. As I mentioned, it's not any one specific program.

Robert Alan Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And just a quick follow-up, Dave -- sorry...

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

Just quickly, Rob. The only thing I would add is that our AS sector has been, and we expect may continue
to be the most impacted by the COVID-related challenges that we spoke about.

Robert Alan Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Yes. And just a follow-up. Do you think 2022 is likely to be the trough for these issues as some of these
other less mature programs start to grow in '23 and beyond?

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Obviously, we'll provide more insight on 2023 as we get to a similar point in 2022. And throughout
the year, we'll talk more about specific programs within that portfolio. I think for some, the trends will
continue; for others, they won't, and we'll defer to a later date to give you more specifics as we look at
the '23 outlook and beyond.

Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I was hoping you could touch a bit on the cash commentary for '22 and just so we can all get to the same
base level you're thinking about, Dave. Is that -- when you talk about the cash taxes being a headwind,
is that assuming the amortization rule sticks around and you have that $1 billion headwind? Or are you
thinking cash taxes are a headwind regardless? And then a similar question as it relates to the double-digit
growth through 2024.

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure. So the kind of high-level view we gave you on '22 through '24 assumes that the amortization of
those R&D costs does not go into effect, though the trend line would be similar. It would be lowest in '22
with an increase in '23 and '24.

But let's talk about it assuming that, that guidance does not go into effect. What I think you can expect
from us in '22 is to continue to drive a similar volume of working capital improvements to what we've done
this year. We've certainly had a good track record over the last couple of years of working capital efficiency
across our business. And that will help to provide that steady level of program-driven cash that we talked
about on the call. We also talked about pretty steady CapEx next year, slightly lower as a percentage of
sales with the sales growth, but a fairly consistent volume on a dollar basis.

And so that means the kind of nonoperating items are what we expect to provide the year-over-year
reduction, $350 million less CAS pension recovery is what we projected today. I think of that more as a
purification of our free cash flow stream. That day was going to come for a while. And so we're reaching
that point now where we've reached a sustainably lower level of CAS reimbursement.

On the cash tax side, we've project that those would be modestly higher without the R&D amortization
provision or other changes in the rate or other key provisions legislatively. Of course, legislation could then
change that further if we don't have a removal or deferral of the R&D tax item, for example. So more to
come on all of those fronts on the January call, but hopefully, that gives you a sense for it today.

As we think about '23 and '24, we do expect continued decline in capital expenditures as a percentage
of sales. We will also benefit from not having the payroll tax deferral in '23 and '24 as we have in '21
and '22. And at the program level, we expect continued working capital efficiencies on some of our key
programs in '23 and '24, which is what gives us the confidence in that increase in those years.

Myles Alexander Walton
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And just 1 quick clarification. The prior CAS outlook had slightly modest growth in CAS recoveries in
'23. That trend line still holds?

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

At this point, yes. I think you'll see much less significant changes in '23 and '24, again, based on what we
see today and based on the actuarial environment today. So from '21 to '22 as well as '20 to '21, we've
had significant reductions in CAS recovery. We no longer expect significant movement really in either
direction in those out years.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.

Douglas Stuart Harned
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I wanted to go back to Aeronautics. And when you described the lower Aeronautics revenues in 2022,
you referred to opportunities long term to reverse that. Those are things like the sixth-gen fighter new
autonomous systems. But I think of those as being fairly long term and fairly uncertain. If you look at that

revenue trajectory the B-21, we should certainly see strong growth come about from that. Do you see that
as sufficient to reverse this trend? And when might that grow to a point that we would see that?

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure. Doug, obviously, that's one that we can't get into much detail on. And so I guess, refer you to the
overall trends that programs tend to see as they're in these phases of the life cycle that we've described
on B-21, and maybe more importantly, that our customer has described on that program. Certainly, it
has been a contributor to our growth in the restricted AS portfolio over the last several years as we've
described. But the go-forward trajectory and the pace and timing of that growth is something we can't say
much more about. So we've given you a sense for the '22 outlook there and where the program stands in
its life cycle, and that's about what we're able to say at this phase.

Douglas Stuart Harned
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. If I switch to F-35 and perhaps go outside of Aeronautics, I think of the kinds of things that you're
doing on F-35 is right at the heart of Tech Refresh 3 systems upgrades. Now that has with it, I'd say, some
good news as there should be a lot of, I would expect, growth there. But there have also been quite a
few challenges that have been highlighted around Tech Refresh 3. Can you talk about both the growth
opportunity that you have on F-35 there as well as how you're dealing with some of the challenges that
have come up?

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

Sure, Doug. This is Kathy. I'll take that. So as you noted, there is opportunity, particularly in our Mission
Systems sector as we look at the Tech Refresh on the F-35 and the mission systems that we provide to
the aircraft. There have been some delays that have been noted this year. They have had some minimal
impacts just on the timing of our work and the funding to support our work, but we have not experienced
performance issues as a result of those delays. It's just shifted some sales out of this year into next.

And in terms of our overall outlook for our Mission Systems work, we do see that. And we've been
consistent in saying that as upside opportunity, while the production volume is flat and price pressure is
driving overall production sales volumes down slightly across the board. The other area you didn't ask
about, but sustainment continues to be an opportunity as well, and we see that both -- in all 3 sectors that
predominantly led through our Defense Systems business for the aircraft, the airframe and our Mission
Systems business with sustainment contracts for the Mission Systems.

Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.

Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Kathy, maybe to follow up on an earlier question, just thinking about the 2022 revenue framework. You
noted Aeronautics is down, but GBSD is growing $500 million, which is less than what we thought. What
are any other major headwinds? And if we roll it up, is it fair to think about 3% to 4% revenue growth for
2022? And maybe as a follow-up to that, you gave some Space color. Maybe if you could just talk about
how you think about the rest of the portfolio outside GBSD.

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Thanks for the question, Sheila. So to unpack the Space growth, both this year and the trends that
we expect to continue into next year, GBSD has contributed roughly 50%, a little bit over 50% to the sales
growth in Space in 2021, and we expect that trend to continue into 2022.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

To your point about $500 million of growth next calendar year being less than you might have anticipated,
you might be looking at budget data, which showed an incremental $1 billion in each of the 2 years. But
I'll remind you that a quarter of that '22 government year is in 2021. So we've seen a more significant
ramp over the course of the 12 months in 2021 than we anticipate in our calendar year 2022. So it's not a
change in profile. It's nothing different. It's just how that falls into our calendar year.

With regard to your broader question on how that translates to our outlook for the company overall, I
think it is safe at this point based on what we know today to suggest that low single-digit growth in 2022
is a reasonable expectation. At this point in the year, we see some COVID impacts that we've referenced.
We saw them in 3Q. We're anticipating those to stay at that same level in Q4. But it is difficult to project
what that impact may be in early 2022. But what I will say is we see those more as speed bumps than
we do derailers. Our fundamentals are intact. We have strong backlog, strong pipeline and great portfolio
alignment to budget priorities. So we still see the path to growth that we've been talking about. We just
have some of these COVID, as I call them speed bumps that we're working our way through. Hopefully,
that helps.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe just following up on the, call it, series of questions, Kathy, because I think this is a question that's
on a lot of people's minds. And obviously, I'm not asking you for guidance, clearly, that would be kind
of out of the game. But how do we think about kind of medium-term growth, right? So when the speed
bumps are behind us and we're kind of in production on B-21, GBSDs kind of humming along, whatever
else is coming along. So if we step out over the next couple of years, how do we think about medium-term
growth?

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

Well, as I said, we see a path to continuing to grow this business, and it's based not only on the strength
of the backlog we have with programs, as you were referencing like B-21 and GBSD, but it's also a
pipeline that includes continued new awards. And I highlighted a few of those today of programs that are
moving into a phase where they will see production awards in the next couple of years. So we still see a
path to growth over the medium term, and it's just a matter of how quickly that growth comes in the next
several quarters as a result of some slowdowns that we've seen.

And I should say, Ron, and I appreciate the opportunity to address that, we've seen fairly minimal supply
chain impact because we have a relatively high NG labor content on our jobs versus external supplier
content. We've talked a bit about the leave taking that we saw being higher in the third quarter but that
too is finite because as people take leave, of course, they're burning down their leave balances. And
when I look over a longer-term period, it trends like labor market issues that may drive labor rates up or
inflation, we have in the industry one of the highest levels of cost plus work. So those costs get passed on
and shared with our customer. Now I do want to emphasize that we in no way want to pass those costs on
to our customers so we are working to minimize those impacts for their benefit, but our shareholders are
not carrying that exposure.

So I feel really good about the portfolio that we have and our ability to weather any of these short-term
impacts or what we expect to be short-term impacts and still be on a path to growth.

Your next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Kathy, just following up on that supply chain challenge. Can you provide more specifics in terms of what
you're seeing? Why they're more prevalent in Aeronautics versus the other segments? And also, right, on
labor, if the vaccine mandate does come into effect December 8, how are you thinking about the potential
impact?

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

So we are implementing the vaccine requirements across our U.S. workforce as the mandate requires us
to do. We are certainly early in our stage of collecting data about our employee status and have a good
sense that a vast majority of our employees are vaccinated or in the process of being vaccinated. And
with other employees, we are working through their options to meet that requirement by December 8. It's
really too early to predict what those impacts might be and so we have a better sense of not just the pure
quantum of employees who may not meet their requirements, but where they work and what they do in
our company, and therefore, how we would mitigate those impacts.

But as I mentioned, we are proactively increasing our hiring now in anticipation that we may have some
loss of workers, and we are ensuring that we have training and skill-building programs in place. So as
we bring those new employees into the workplace, they can get productive and efficient as quickly as
possible. So actively working to mitigate impacts, but they're just too difficult to really quantify for you at
this time.

Kristine Tan Liwag
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. And the specifics on the supply chain challenges with Aeronautics?

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

For us, it's been relatively minimal. As we have seen our own increases in leave taking, we've seen the
same thing in our suppliers. And that was primarily driven by 2 things in the third quarter. We estimate,
one, with the Delta variant, we saw increased case counts, and therefore, people out of the workforce
while they either recovered from COVID or staying out based on close contact, and we understand that
our suppliers saw a similar phenomenon.

And then the other was that people had not been taking leave at the same rate. But as things started
to open up, people actually took some well-needed and deserved vacation. So those are the 2 primary
drivers that we saw as our suppliers saw the same, which slows down deliveries a bit. But as I noted, we
see those as being temporal, in that leave taking is somewhat limited at this point in time.

Operator

Can we go to the next question? We'll go right back to Noah.

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure.

Operator

Okay. We have David -- Noah, your line is open. You there?

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Sorry. Yes. I was just wondering, Dave, if you could speak to what you're assuming directionally for
margins in that projection on a total company basis.

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure. So we're really pleased to have been able to increase our 2021 segment operating margin rate
guidance for the second time now to another 10 basis point increase this year. As we noted in 2022, we
won't have the 20 to 30 basis point benefit that we have this year from the pension-driven overhead rate
benefits that we experienced in our EACs in the first quarter of the year. And we anticipate being able to
offset a portion of that reduction as we look to 2022.

I don't think it's -- it requires a specific assumption for '23 and '24 margin rate to get to the general trend
that we're providing for those years. We'll be more specific about margin rate outlook as we get closer
to those years. But I think a relatively stable margin rate would get you to the trends that we've talked
about in '23 and '24 with a healthy double-digit CAGR as it relates to free cash flow from the '22 base up
to that '24 level. Again, no payroll tax deferral, a bit of efficiency on the capital expenditure side and some
program-driven opportunities are what really drive that.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So just, Dave, to follow up on that so I'm clear. So you're guiding segment margin overall lower versus, I
guess, whatever that, call, 11.8% midpoint for 2021, you're guiding it lower in '22? And then in terms of
free cash flow on an absolute basis, is '23 and '24 free cash flow higher than 2021 transaction-adjusted
free cash flow just on an absolute basis?

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure. Let me address both of those, David. On the segment OM rate, you're right to think about the
2 factors we've described in '22 compared with our increased guidance for 2021. We'll look to offset a
portion of the 20 to 30 basis point reduction that we would see from the absence of those rate benefits
in '22. We'll look to offset a portion of that 20 to 30 basis points through continued strong operating
performance, but not all of the 20 to 30 basis points on the OM rate side.

And look, in terms of the '23 and '24 free cash flow, we've got a lot of moving pieces yet to be determined
on the tax side, as we mentioned. Things can continue to move as they often do on the pension side.
So based on what we know today, I think what's best to say today is we anticipate that healthy growth
outlook in '23 and '24 as we get to January and provide more specifics on the '22 level of free cash flow

and no more than we could know today in terms of tax legislation and such. We'll provide a bit further

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Yes. Dave, I wanted a clarification. When you say AS decline at a rate similar to '21, is that -- because
organically, it's more like down 2% with the equipment sale taken out of it, or are you talking the 5% that
you just see?

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Right. We're comparing to the actual mid-single-digit decline in 2021 when we say we're having a --
expecting a similar trajectory in 2022. It's a good question. Thanks for the clarification, George.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Okay. And then what changed, if anything -- or what changed to that the CAS pension dropped so much
next year? I know you talked about it coming down, but I hadn't expected it to come down the magnitude
that it is.

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure. The $350 million number is pretty consistent with what we've been projecting in recent months. And
in the July and April earnings calls, there was legislation regarding pension earlier this year that affected
some of the actuarial assumptions used for CAS purposes and reduced that number. And then the other
factor is, in 2021, the CAS number came up by about $60 million, as we noted on the call today. So the
compare from 2021 to 2022 got $60 million tougher, but the '22 level has been pretty stable for us since
that new legislation came out in the spring.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.

Cai von Rumohr
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

So by the middle of '22, we'll know about the R&D tax credit. And as you look at '23, '24, you're saying,
a, we don't have the payroll tax repayment. We have lower CapEx. We have better ops. And we have less
downside in terms of CAS. So you're basically saying we're going to have considerably better cash flow.
And you also have a strong balance sheet, good, low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Your major peer, basically
in a somewhat similar situation although they have CAS going against them, has taken a more aggressive
stance toward their strategic use of share repurchase and dividend hikes to return value to shareholders.
Your situation looks actually similar, if not better. Is that something you would consider?

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

Cai, it's not just something we would consider, we have been articulating throughout the year that we
do see a majority of our free cash flow being returned to shareholders over this period. And it is in part
why we increased the dividend again this year. And we have committed to at least $3 billion of share
repurchase in 2021. You could expect to see those trends for cash returning to shareholders in the next
couple of years as well.

Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

But actually, Lockheed is implying that their net debt will go up if you consider all of their numbers. So
they're basically saying they're looking at net debt because EBITDA is going up, that basically increasing
the net debt somewhat because of the strength of their balance sheet. Is that something you would
consider? Or is it basically just the cash flow that's available?

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure, Cai. I think you noted appropriately at the beginning that we'll know more in the next few quarters
than we do today about tax legislation and other factors. We'll know more about the COVID environment,
the budget environment. And so all of these are factors that we think about as we look at our capital
allocation plans.

I think Kathy's point is the important one around the priority for us over the next couple of years will
remain, first and foremost, after making critical investments in our business as we've said we will continue
to do. The next priority is around returning cash to shareholders over these next couple of years. Whether
we choose to change our net debt balance over the next few years or not will, in some ways, be affected
by those broader factors, and we'll update you and others as we know more and get into 2022 on that
front. This year, we achieved our credit rating targets and feel like we're in a good stable position there.
So again, we'll know more and update you all as we do.

Operator

All right. Your last question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.

Seth Michael Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. I think I got one more here. So I guess as far as backlog, when would you expect backlog to kind
of stabilize? And given the decline we've seen year-to-date in the Defense Systems backlog, what gives
you confidence on the growth outlook there?

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

So Seth, we see our book-to-bill being close to 1 again this year, have some significant awards that we
anticipate in the fourth quarter. And our backlog has grown over 90% since the end of 2017. So to your
point, there -- we don't expect that kind of accelerated growth in our backlog. It currently sits at over 2x
sales. So it's quite strong, and we feel supports the continued growth of the business for several years to
come.

Seth Michael Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 28, 2021

Just Defense backlog has been down fairly significantly year-to-date and calling for growth next year. I
know there are some kind of growth programs in that segment, but kind of what gives you confidence in
the Defense Systems business growing next year?

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. So that business also has some key awards in the fourth quarter of this year that were positioned for
its growth next year. We also, in Defense, see it's our shortest cycle business, so they do tend to run more
of a 1:1 backlog-to-sales ratio. And the only other thing I would point to there is we have been trailing off
Lake City, and that, of course, has impacted no new awards and a tough year-over-year compare. But as
we look forward, that will stabilize in looking at the backlog-to-sales ratio in that business. Anything you'd
add, Dave?

David F. Keffer
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes. Of course, the year-over-year backlog comparisons in DS, in particular, would be affected by the
divestiture of the IT services business. To a lesser degree in MS and Space, but certainly thinking of more
of an organic change in that DS backlog is important in this particular year.

Todd B. Ernst
Vice President of Investor Relations

All right. We'll leave it there, Kathy.

Kathy J. Warden
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. Well, once again, I want to thank the Northrop Grumman team for delivering another solid quarter.
We are actively working to mitigate the COVID-related risks that we talked about today and finish this
year strong with robust sales growth and other strong EPS performance and solid free cash flow. And
our initial 2022 outlook, as we've said, is expected to continue to deliver growth and strong operating
performance again next year. And we look forward to providing you some details around that guidance in
our January call. We wish you all well, and thanks again for joining our call today.
