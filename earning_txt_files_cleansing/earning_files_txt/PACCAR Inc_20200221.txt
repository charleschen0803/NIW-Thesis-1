Presentation

Operator

Good morning. And welcome to PACCAR's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. And if anyone has any objections, they should disconnect at
this time.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings,
please go ahead.

Ken Hastings
Senior Director of Investor Relations

Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name
is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Preston Feight,
Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley,
Senior Vice President and Controller.

As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-
only mode.

Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including
general, economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. For additional information,
please see our SEC filings and the Investor Relations page of paccar.com.

I would now like to introduce Preston Feight.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, good morning, everyone. Harrie Schippers and I will update you on our first quarter results and our
business highlights.

I'd like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation to all PACCAR employees for their
dedication, hard work and their upbeat spirit as we tackle today's challenges and work towards a bright
future.

The trucking industry has been declared as an essential business. PACCAR employees, along with our
dealers, are providing critical support to our customers who are delivering medical supplies, food and
essential services to our communities around the world. I also want to express my gratitude and thanks
to the millions of men and women who are working hard to support those affected by the pandemic.
I'm pleased to share that the PACCAR foundation has donated $2 million to United Way and other
organizations to help our communities.

Over the next few weeks, we're beginning a gradual resumption of truck production at selected factories.
The specific restart timing for each plant and office location is being aligned with government directives,
implementation of our work and social distancing measures, parts availability from suppliers, and our
business needs. During this gradual restart, our highest priority is on ensuring the health and safety of our
employees and their families.

Looking at our first quarter financial results. PACCAR achieved good revenues and net income. PACCAR's
first quarter sales and financial services revenues were $5.2 billion, and first quarter net income was $359
million.

PACCAR delivered 38,400 trucks during the first quarter. PACCAR parts achieved quarterly revenues of
$999 million. Parts pretax profits were a record $215 million, 3% higher than the same period last year.
Truck and parts gross margins were 12.3% in the first quarter. The first quarter results included $50
million in higher accruals for product support costs.

PACCAR INC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

PACCAR Financial achieved pretax income of $48 million. DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth delivered excellent
heavy-duty market share in the first quarter. Kenworth and Peterbilt's U.S. and Canada market share
increased to 30.4% compared to 30% for the full year of 2019. DAF's European market share increased
to 16.7% in the first quarter compared to 16.2% last year. And in Brazil, in the above 40-tonne segment,
first quarter DAF market share increased to a record 8.7% compared to 6.1% last year, fantastic work.

PACCAR has steadily grown market share over the long term by delivering excellent value to our
customers in terms of product quality, innovative technologies and low total cost of ownership. The
global macroeconomic environment is uncertain at this time. Therefore, we will not provide guidance on
estimated 2020 truck industry market sizes, next quarter's truck deliveries and gross margins and PACCAR
Parts revenues.

Our employees are doing an excellent job managing through the pandemic. We are rigorously aligning cost
to the changing market conditions, including reducing capital investment and research and development
costs. As a result of the company's strong culture and discipline, we have achieved 81 consecutive years of
profitability and have a bright future.

Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other
business highlights. Harrie?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

Thanks, Preston. PACCAR continues to provide strong operating cash flow for reinvestment in future
growth and distributions to stockholders.

Operating cash flow was $416 million in the first quarter. PACCAR delivered an excellent return on
invested capital of 23% over the last 5 years due to a combination of strong profitability and a consistent
conservative approach to investing in the business.

Yesterday, the PACCAR Board of Directors announced a regular quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share.
PACCAR has a strong balance sheet with $4.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, no manufacturing
debt and A+/A1 credit rating.

PACCAR Parts achieved quarterly revenues of $999 million, which is comparable to the same period last
year. Parts' pretax profits were a record $215 million, 3% higher than the first quarter last year. To drive
growth, PACCAR has made consistent investments in parts distribution capacity and customer-focused
technologies. PACCAR Parts will open 2 new parts distribution centers this year. One is in Ponta Grossa,
Brazil and the other one is in Las Vegas, Nevada. PACCAR Parts has also made significant investments in
its e-commerce platform, which is benefiting our customers and dealers in this challenging time.

PACCAR Financial Services' first quarter revenues were $384 million, and pretax income was $48 million,
reflecting lower used truck sales results. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values command a 10% to
15% premium over competitors' trucks. PACCAR Financial is investing to increase its retail used truck
sample capacity worldwide, which enhances its used truck sales margins. PACCAR Financial recently
opened a used truck center in Denton, Texas, and plans to open additional used truck In Prague, Czech
Republic and in Madrid, Spain this year. PACCAR Financial Services has excellent ongoing access to the
debt markets, including commercial paper on a regular basis -- issuing commercial paper on a regular
basis.

During the first quarter, PACCAR issued 3- and 5-year term notes, totaling $632 million. In addition, in
early April, PACCAR Financial issued a $400 million, 3-year fixed rate note. We have reduced 2020 capital
expenditures by $100 million to a range of $525 million to $575 million, and have reduced research and
development expenses by $45 million to a range of $265 million to $295 million.

PACCAR's strong financial position enables us to continue investing in important capital and R&D projects
in all market conditions. And finally, we thank our excellent, independent, Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF
dealers for their support of our customers. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers are well-capitalized and
have invested $2.6 billion in their businesses in the last 10 years. These investments continue to make

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies.

Stephen Edward Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Maybe, Preston, we go back to your opening comments, I'm curious about -- a little more detail about
how you're thinking about reopening production because you mentioned a number of things there. You
mentioned sort of local regulations. You mentioned parts availability, and then you mentioned kind of
market demand. So there's sort of 3 buckets to think about there. But can you give us any more color of
the rate of reopening that you might expect as we go forward?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Hey, Stephen, good to talk to you. Very glad to. I'd tell you that the most important thing as we think
about restart is, again, I keep reemphasizing this is the health of our employees, their families are
concerned for getting it right, making sure we take care of them. That's #1, that's #2 and that's #3 for
us actually. And then as we look about it, we obviously want to make sure that we have alignment with
the government agencies. That's really important to us so that we're staying aligned with best practices
for how we can reopen, restart society. It's also important that we think about our supply base and their
readiness for the restart of our factories and make sure we stay aligned with them. And then, of course,
our business needs.

So all those things together and where we're thinking about it, and I can -- really pleased with the best
practices that we put in place in the factories. As far as temperature-taking for our employees, the
distancing protocols, separation of the employees with spacing and barriers, and then wearing masks and
personal protective equipment and enhanced cleaning. So all those things are going into our approach for
reopening the factories.

It is going to be a gradual reopening. It's going to be done on a location-by-location basis in a phased
manner. We already started some this week. In fact, we're kind of in the start-up of operations in Europe
and in Australia. And then we will work through the rest of our plants in the coming weeks and make sure
we take care of the employees and bring the truck factories back up and running.

Stephen Edward Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So would you like to have everything back up and running at some level by the end of the quarter,
perhaps? That's a good way to kind of put bookends around that.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

That's a long window, and I feel pretty good about that. I think we're thinking of sooner, but we obviously
don't have the final answers, and we are working through that in a constructive way with the local
agencies and supply base.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.

PACCAR INC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

I guess, following on Steve's question, PACCAR really has a strong supply chain management track record.
You mentioned that, that's one of the factors. A couple of questions, if I may, about that. First, have you
encountered any smaller suppliers running into liquidity issues? And then second, it seems like the world
may be looking at kind of a piecemeal reopening in terms of when to ease the current virus containment
efforts. How much of an impact/challenge could that have or be to get your operations back up and
running?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

A great question. It's a fun thing for our teams to be working through right now with our suppliers. We
have such good communication with them right now that it's really helpful to know when you can tell the
relationships matter is we're paying attention to what they're doing and when their restart timings are.
And large and small suppliers have been doing a really good job of keeping us informed of their readiness.
And they're doing the same things we are. They're trying to take care of their employees, they're trying to
make sure they stay in line with the governments, and then they're moving forward with restart. And so
far, that's part of the whole puzzle we're putting together and getting the truck factories back up.

Andrew Millard Casey
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just a question on the quarter in the truck segment. The decremental margins were
somewhere around 25% and 26% revenue drop. It's not the highest PACCAR has ever seen, but it's kind
of higher than typical. You mentioned product accrual was running high. But could you give us a little more
color on what kind of growth the margin compression? I mean, obviously, some of it is the shutdown.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, I think that, as you mentioned, we had the $50 million that we took the opportunity to book for the
improvement of our continuous refinement of our engines. Our MX engines was a lot of that. We're doing
some software and hardware upgrades on the engine. So that's something that we want to do is make
sure that our customers keep having the best of experiences on the account of their engines. And as far
as what the future looks like, we're going to see how the pandemic works its way through the system, and
that will certainly be something we're all watching closely.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on dealer inventory levels, very pressing discussion
we had last quarter. Obviously, you have a different environment, but I'm wondering if you could give
us an update on the declines in dealer inventory levels in March and anticipated declines from here. And
in the conversation around timing of the restart, I'm wondering if that calculus has evolved at all, given
potentially an opportunity to lean out inventories before ramping up production.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure, sure. Glad to. So the North American industry has roughly 3.8 months of retail sales and inventory,
and PACCAR has less than that. We have 3.4 months retail sales through March for Kenworth and Peterbilt
dealers. And of our 3.4 months, roughly half of that is at body builders. So that's being worked on right
now. And I'm sure inventory's in really good shape right now.

PACCAR INC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

Okay. And in terms of the parts part of the business, can you talk about what the cadence has been in
April? Obviously, very steady performance in the March quarter. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to talk
about what kind of trends you've seen so far in April.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

One of the things that's interesting, and this kind of gives a little help, I hope, is that 75% of all goods
are moved by trucks. And so a lot of the trucking companies are really busy right now, and they're
moving around the country, taking care of our communities. And as that's happening, those trucks end
up consuming parts, so there was a lot of strong activity in March, and we still have activity going on
in April. And we'll kind of watch how the quarter develops, but we expect our Parts team to continue to
perform really well. And they have great programs. One of the things that's been nice to watch is their e-
commerce programs and the way they're handling our customers and working directly with customers and
dealers to support these critical needs is going really well.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then in terms of the operational discussion, the conversation you just had with Andy on the
warranty program. So if we back out the warranty program, decremental margins would have been 20%.
Is that the sort of run rate that we're comfortable thinking through? Or is the level of being shut down
for most of April, if not all of April, does that throw that type of decremental margin math off-kilter as we
think about what this quarter might look like?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I think that we're -- your assessment of the impact of the product support fees does match into the
margin. But I would say that looking forward and what it's going to be going forward, we're going to watch
how the situation develops, and when we get our factories running and what the state of the economy is
in the second quarter.

Jerry David Revich
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. And maybe just a clarification on the warranty program. Was that just a onetime over-the-air
software update or across the population? Or can you just give us some context behind what exactly that
warranty item was?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, we had the opportunity to optimize the performance of our trucks and engines, mostly on our
MX engine from the 2017 to 2019 engines. And so that was hardware and software upgrades. And this
accrual, we think, we got that all covered and making sure that our customers have optimally performing
trucks and engines, always part of our game plan.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Thein of Citigroup.

Timothy Thein
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

The first question I had was on loss provisions within the Finkel. And they were certainly higher than I
was expecting, at least the absolute level was not -- obviously not directionally, but maybe if you could
comment there in terms of -- is there a specific region or a customer set that maybe you'd call out? And
I'm just thinking about how that potentially looks going forward. Should we, at least shorter term, have

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

PACCAR INC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

a more challenging backdrop for truckers, at least in North America? So maybe just how to think about,
again, loss provisions and what you experienced in the quarter?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

Yes. The $15 million increase in credit loss provision reflects the weaker economy, and a weaker economy
under the new CECL accounting standards result in a more volatile number. So with that weak economy,
the calculation resulted in a $15 million higher credit loss provision. If we look at the finance company, the
portfolio is in really good shape. We have a very healthy mix of very good A and B customers. And past
dues remain really low, currently less than 1%. So the finance company is in good shape, but the weak
economy and the accounting standards drive most of that increase in credit loss reserve.

Timothy Thein
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. Maybe just one last one. Preston, I'm curious from the Parts team, how -- I'm not sure how closely
they follow it. But MacKay -- and I know you're not talking or you're not giving guidance on parts sales
specifically, but it kind of jumped out at me. I saw MacKay put out a forecast the other day that they
expect, and again, this -- not to say this aligns with PACCAR exactly. But I'm talking about parts demand
to be down like 20% in the U.S. I'm just curious if you had any comments on that.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, I don't really have any comments on MacKay's numbers. I know what we're watching is a team
that's got great programs and really strongly positioned to support with not just parts, but knowledge, and
they're doing a great job of that. And as I said, talking to a lot of customers and our dealers, there is a lot
of activity still going out there and we'll support at the level that's needed.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan.

Ann P. Duignan
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

On the used equipment values, about 28% of your finance book is European, and most of that, I think, is
probably guaranteed residuals. So can you talk about the used pricing in the Finkel business and what that
might manifest -- how that might manifest itself as we go forward here?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

Used truck prices in Europe came down a little bit in the first quarter. North America used truck prices
was mostly flat, of course, down compared to where we were a year ago. Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks
command a 10% to 15% premium over our competitor vehicles. So we're in a really good shape from that
perspective. But adding used truck retail centers, opening 1 in Czech Republic this quarter. Just added 1
in Denton, Texas. The used truck inventories, as far as we can tell in Europe are a little bit higher than
where they've been, especially for the industry. DAF's used truck inventory is in relatively good shape if
you compare it to where the rest of the inventory -- the industry is. Anything you want to add there?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes, that's exactly right. I mean, we are -- we have a lower percentage of the inventory of used trucks in
Europe than the industry does, and that puts us in good positions.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

PACCAR INC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

But you didn't call out Europe -- used prices in Europe being weaker than they were a quarter ago or
weaker than they were last year.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

They were a little bit lower than a quarter ago and lower than a year ago. But...

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

That's kind of industry-wide there.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

That's industry-wide. Yes.

Ann P. Duignan
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just on production cuts, can you give us any kind of direction in terms of the number of
deliveries, truck deliveries you had in Q1? And any idea as you ramp back up, what you would expect
deliveries to be quarter-over-quarter? I mean I know you can't see past the second quarter. But as you
ramp, any direction, at least give us a ballpark for Q1 and then where we might think about Q2 being?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure, Ann. We can talk a little bit about that and that deliveries were 38,400 for the 3-month period.
But as far as what we'll see going forward, like I said, I'd come back to is, our biggest focus right now is
making sure that our employees are well cared for. And as we watch that and take care of that, then we'll
ramp back up our production and we'll align that to the demand, and we'll see where that takes us in the
second quarter.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

My question is sort of bigger picture. Trying to think about this period, the nuances of how this is different
or similar than '08, '09, sort of how you -- what are the differences, the similarities between how you're
handling this period and that period, with maybe 3 things in particular, if you could address at a minimum.

You mentioned in your prepared remarks, 81 consecutive years of profitability. Obviously, back in '09,
there were 2 quarters that were basically around breakeven. Just wanted to see if you could address the
idea of this being year number 82, just if you're willing to speak to that.

Second, the gross margin declines roughly were kind of 14.5%, 15%, they dropped down to 8% to 8.5%
in 2009. Just trying to get some sense of magnitude, what's different about the business model, more
parts, whatever it may be.

And lastly, the special dividend. Your balance sheet, the equipment company was still net cash back in '09,
but you still chose to greatly reduce the special dividend year-over-year. Just wanted to try to lead those
3 key pieces in in answering the question of the differences and similarities of today versus the Great
Recession.

PACCAR INC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

Sure, David. Good to talk with you. First off, you got to start by thinking that we did succeed in '08 and
'09. And as we look at the company right now, as we sit here in 2020, we're an even stronger company
than we were there. We have $4.3 billion in cash sitting on our balance sheet. We have great liquidity. We
have great access to liquidity in the market, still. That hasn't changed during this time frame. Our Parts
business has grown over that more than a decade. And it's just a foundational part of our business and
does a great job. And we have an experienced leadership team that has been through a lot of cycles. And
we know how to manage things, we know how to control costs. And we have amazing trucks and engines
out there. The MX engine is doing a great job, and it's 43% of our build. So that's helpful to us from a
parts standpoint. Just the business that we've built is really strong and is doing a good job of taking care
of our customers, and freight continues to move in this environment. So we feel positive about our future
and the products we have on the field and those that we're developing.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

But could you address those 3 issues to some degree? Just the idea of however you feel the flex in your
costs, how the situation may be? And even just your framework, sounds like you do expect, obviously,
some uneven, but at least some reopening of the factories in the not too distant future. Can we look at '09
as a guide point that if you're able to stay profitable in that environment, this should be similar? The gross
margins getting cut in half, roughly a little bit better than that is a framework? And also the handling of
the special dividend? If you can just give some parameters of the difference now versus then for those 3
issues in particular.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, let's just take the last and you mentioned on dividends. And we announced our dividends yesterday
for the first quarter at $0.32 a share, which is a strong indicator of what we've done. We have a great
history of dividends, and we look forward to what our future is going to be, and that's a Board decision.
And we take care of that as we progress through the year based upon the results.

I think that -- I don't think that it's a fair thing to think of it as an '08, '09 kind of a thing. They're just
different. Each situation is unique. And what we've got is freight being moved. And I'm kind of giving you
-- the kind of the truth of the matter is the freight is being moved, our company is well-built, we have a
great position in terms of our liquidity, our cash position, our product investments. Our trucks are the best
in the world, and that feels pretty good.

David Michael Raso
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And the comfort in the larger parts business and a business that's more on your own vertically integrated
drivetrain than back then, is that something else that we should take a little more comfort in versus '09?
But at the same time, the unevenness of the production, it's really less of almost your decision that when
you can ramp up. I mean is that the yin and yang here, better about parts, a little more uncertain about
the truck margins just given, in a way, that's out of your hands?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure. We have the stronger foundational parts market. We have the growth in our engine business, right?
And in '08, '09, it wasn't here in North America. So that's good. I think the other thing to think about the
share growth over that time frame has been significant. So we've had really strong share growth over
that time, which contributes extra volume to us. And PACCAR does a great job. Our team is so good at
adjusting the business, both in capital and expense side, to think about how the business should be run.
And so we really do adjust to the market conditions.

And so just to follow-up on kind of the thrust of Ann and David's questioning, does your intelligence -- like
what you know and see today and hear, does that give you a sense that by the end of the second quarter,
you'll be able to give us more -- a more whatever it is, like a clearer view of what the rest of the year
looks like, and how things play out?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I think that's -- as a general sense, it seems like by the next quarter gets through us, we'll have a lot
more information than we do today. And we'll share with you what we can at that point.

Joel Gifford Tiss
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And then I wonder if you could give us a little bit of a sense -- like you're kind of hinting at flexibility in the
factories, and every time you walk through, there's fewer and fewer people or there's more automation,
whatever the right way to say it is. Can you give us a sense of some of the internal focus points you guys
are kind of using this pandemic as an opportunity to come out of this situation stronger over the next 5 or
10 years than you were going into it?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, I think -- what I look at is -- the first thing comes to my mind is, when we go to our factories, when
I go to our factories and I meet with our people, whether it's in a distribution center or a truck factory or
anywhere, is just how impressive they are. And we have such an incredible group of people, and they're
just exceptional. They're just exceptional people. I'm so proud of them and what they're doing. So they're
the ones that are every day thinking of new ways to optimize our efficiencies and effectiveness, and they
do it every day. And they continue in that vein, and we use Six Sigma as a great tool for ourselves and
optimizing, and we'll continue doing that. This is accretive time for us as we look at truck production and
how we come back, and we'll learn some new things, and they'll be helpful to improving the business and
making us even more effective and efficient as we look forward.

Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker of Baird.

David Jon Leiker
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I want to try and dig through a little bit of kind of the segments within the trucking space and your
customers. I mean there are some parts that are strong, consumer-focused, package; delivery-focused.
There are some that are really weak, energy and auto related. Can you talk a little bit about that customer
mix for you, for your products and how that would compare to the industry overall in general?

PACCAR INC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

Sure. You did a good job of summarizing what's really going on. If you look at refrigerated carriers or
protein haulers, they obviously have just seen a shift in where their business is going. So those long-haul
trucking companies that are delivering that are doing well. Locational segment is where we're a market
leader, the market leader. And that business has been strong, and I mentioned that part of our inventory
is at body builders right now. So that inventory is being built and being ready for production for a summer
season.

And I think as you look at some of the over-the-road trucking companies, it varies by company. Talking
with some of them, they have a good base of customers. And those that have a good base of customers,
they're really well positioned. And there, as you said, the energy sector has been lower, but the yang
to that ying is that fuel prices are down 20%. And if fuel prices are 1/3 of the operating cost for a
trucking company, then that's helping them from their operating models as well. So that's kind of -- you
characterized it well, and that's a little bit more information on it.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America.

Ross Paul Gilardi
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I had 2 questions. First one on the PDCs and the 2 additional ones that you're going to add, can you
quantify at all how big of a global increase in parts footprint that this will represent when you open them?
And do you worry at all about adding parts distribution capacity in the middle of a recession? And I'm
trying to just get at -- like how many -- you guys have added a lot of distribution centers over the last 5
to 10 years, and granted that market's not going to move like -- as volatile as the overall truck cycle. But
if we're in a slower economy for a longer period of time, do you bump up and will limit at some point how
much you can continue to expand that distribution network?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure. We have 18 distribution centers. We'll be adding 2 more. I was just down in the Las Vegas facility
a couple of weeks ago, the new one. It's just beautiful. And I know the employees are excited to move
in there because we're talking about it. I think one of the things that's happening is there's always
opportunity to gain share, and we continue to use those distribution centers and the best practices around
them to gain share. For example, if our distribution centers are more closely aligned to our dealer body,
then we're able to deliver more overnight parts to our customers and keep their uptime at maximum
levels, which is one of our key objectives. And that gives us a competitive advantage against the market.
So that's part of the thinking. It's not just about parts and storing. And it's about getting them to the
customers as quickly as possible, and that's going -- been really successful for us in helping the parts
team grow the business.

Ross Paul Gilardi
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. So is it fair -- are they all fairly similar in size? If you're adding 2 on a network of 18, is it sort of like
a 10% increase? And will the business benefit from just some type of pipeline fill? And I don't know if that
would be a second quarter event or a second half event that will help continue to support the top line for
the parts business this year?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure. You're right in saying it will continue to support the top line growth for the business. And yes,
roughly 10%. There is some variance in the size of the PDCs, but they're roughly the right order -- same
orders of magnitude.

PACCAR INC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

Okay. Got you. And then just lastly, can you quantify your energy exposure? I realize it's tricky, but maybe
at the very least, you could tell us what portion of your U.S. and Canadian dealer network is located in the
Gulf region or other energy-dependent regions? And anything like that would be really useful.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes, we have a very diversified portfolio. It's not concentrated overly in the energy sector. So the dealers
that have -- there are some dealers that obviously have more exposure, but our dealers are doing just
such a great job of building their businesses that they have good absorption, good parts and service
businesses throughout a diversified customer bases, even for themselves. And so dealer body is in really
good shape and managing that well.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Crédit Suisse.

Jamie Lyn Cook
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I guess just 2 questions. One, can you just talk to, like on the truck side in Europe and in the U.S., like
what you're hearing from your customers in terms of trends in April. And understanding you don't want to
give an industry forecast, but what your customers are sort of telling you how they're thinking about the
year because that would imply you're probably managing your business for that -- for whatever they're
telling you.

And then, I guess, just my second question, understanding you're taking initiatives to cut R&D and CapEx.
But how do you think sort of the coronavirus impacts, people's view around alternative technologies like
EV or fuel cell relative to diesel, in particular, with diesel prices lower now? Perhaps we focus more on
economics. So if you could help give color on that, that would be helpful.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. Sure. Good to talk to you, Jamie. I'd say from a customer standpoint, we do talk to a lot of our
customers and the dealers and keep track what's going on. And there is -- as we said before, some
segments are doing well, and some are experiencing moderate slowdowns, and that's to be expected in a
situation with this much dynamic factoring going into it. But we've got a good customer base, and they do
a good job managing their business. So they're making the adjustments. And there's some trucks that are
not as fully utilized, that's true. But I'm pretty impressed with how they talk about their business and their
customer base. And again, they're an essential part of our economy, and they will continue to move freight
and are continuing to move freight. So that's pretty important to keep perspective on.

From a tech standpoint and an R&D CapEx alignment to that, and when I look at that, I'd say we have
some really neat programs going on. And we're continuing on some of the exciting programs that we have
within our portfolios, and some of those are R&D-related. So whether that's battery-electric vehicles or
work that we're doing, that work's going to continue. We're going to keep moving along and doing the
critical things that are going to build a bright future for our company and provide our customers the lowest
operating costs possible. So it's kind of a bit of a look at what's going on.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS.

Steven Fisher
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just -- you guys called out some nice market share gains across the regions. What does your order share
in backlog tell you about what your market share of retail and production might be over the next few
quarters? And are there any regional differences?

PACCAR INC FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Well, yes, I think we have seen good market share gains. As we mentioned, the 30.4% in the U.S. and
16.7% in Europe and really strong 8.7% in Brazil. And in the medium-duty side, also good growth in both
Europe and North America. So that's been good. And as far as what order intake has been, I think in the
last month we have numbers for we had was March, and we had 38% of the order intake in the month of
March. We're in a good position.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

So more color on Europe. I think the market share growth to 16.7% for DAF has been in most markets,
especially the U.K. In the U.K., our share in the first quarter has grown to 35%. So we're really benefiting
from the fact that we have an excellent factory in Leyland and are able to build our trucks for the U.K. in
the U.K.

Steven Fisher
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then you have some plans to open up some international used truck centers. How much better
do you expect the used margins to be at these company-owned retail centers versus any other used sales
channels that are out there?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

With the -- those used truck centers, one of the benefits that we have is that they predominantly sell to
retail customers. And the margins we make when we sell a used truck to a retail customer are significantly
higher than selling them to wholesalers or other customers. So those used truck centers really give us a
very nice return on our investment there.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Actually, I wanted to follow-up on Steve's last question on the used sales mix. Is there any color you can
provide on sort of where you see the channel mix, where it's today, where you think it's going as far as
retail versus wholesale or auction? Anything that we can kind of used to frame what the opportunity there
is to get the margins up?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

What I look at is the PACCAR Financial team has done a really good job of building this used truck center
network. And we've seen even in the U.S., an uptick in the recent time of more retail activity flowing
through the used truck centers. And as we build like the one in Prague and expand our capabilities, that
just creates an outlet for the strong customer demand for PACCAR products in the used market. And
it gives them a good place to go to get a young truck that's going to serve their needs really well, and
they're happy to buy those trucks from us because they know what they're getting. That helps values.

Seth Robert Weber
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Right. Okay. And then sorry if I missed this, but have you address -- have you talked to just the new truck
pricing environment? I think last quarter, you said it was up about 2%. Just wondering if anything has
changed, given the -- that the macro and then also the weakness in used pricing, if anybody -- if any of

your competitors are doing anything irrational? Or is that -- you're still seeing positive pricing on the new
truck side.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. Well, I'll let you talk to the competitors and what they do that's irrational. But for us, what we see is
we've seen steadiness in pricing. And I think there continues to be a strong desire to have the best trucks,
which are Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley.

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I was wondering if you could just share with us a little bit more detail on how to think about some of the
fixed costs associated with the plant shutdowns and then also with the plant reopenings, and if any of the
protocols that you're enacting that could last for a bit longer might impact the cost basis over the next 12
to 18 months.

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure. As far as the protocols we're implementing, I'll come back to the statement because it's core to us is
our biggest focus right now is making sure that our employees are cared for and operate in a healthy and
safe environment. And so those protocols, things like temperature testing when they enter the facilities
and making sure there's 6 feet between them or 1.5 meters in Europe that we have put up spacing and
barriers where we're building the trucks, that people are wearing masks, that we're doing great cleaning
and that we're comparing all of our practices that I just described to other industry leaders to make
sure we have the best practices in place. Those will carry on as long as they need to, to make sure that
our employees are healthy and protected. And they're involved in the process and want them to feel
comfortable with their environments, and that's really important to us.

And then as far as the costs that we experience, right? We're a company that's always thinking about
capital cost and expense costs and looking for ways to reduce them. And our teams are fully focused on
that. Looking -- that's why you see the reduction in the CapEx spending plans that we outlined in our
opening comments and why we're looking at R&D reductions that we can take, just so that the business is
optimized and set up for this industry cycle.

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Is there anything you could share with us that's just maybe about factory overhead costs that might not
be getting to cut just for the weeks that you're shut down, and then if there's any difference between the
shutdowns in North America versus in Europe?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. There -- the difference is that we have furloughed some employees during the stopping point, and
that's what we've done in North America and Europe. In the Netherlands, we have a good relationship with
our unions there, with our employees there and with the government there. And they've been able to help
us support people still working during the shutdown, in the overhead side of the business, and that's great
because we're continuing to make progress in these practices to keep a healthy and safe environment.
And even on the engineering side, they're continuing to work on new projects and processes that are
aligned with government support programs.

PACCAR qualifies to all those programs.

Courtney Yakavonis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then just lastly, your parts margins did hold up very well this quarter. You mentioned that you've been
building out the e-commerce platform, but are you seeing any structural changes that you think might last
in terms of how your customers are interacting with that business in this environment?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

I think that this may hasten the move towards more and more e-commerce in the parts business. But our
-- and our team has built a great system to make that available for the customers and for the dealers to
work with. And we continue to use the e-commerce and the MDI systems to help everybody have the right
parts at the right places at the right time, so we can make sure our customers' uptime is optimized. There
may be a little bit of a move towards that furthering, and that's good for PACCAR and good for our parts
team.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Elkott of Cowen.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

So the truckload industry, which is an important part of your customer base, had been dealing with some
headwinds like rising insurance premiums and low freight rates, which was resulting in a lot of market
exits. But now they also have the tailwind of lower diesel prices. So my question is if we start to see an
economic rebound, while at the same time, oil prices lag and remain relatively low, which would be good
for the health of the truckload industry, do you have any sense of how quickly that could translate into
higher orders? And are you happy that you could see a benefit from that?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

That's a good commentary you offered. I think it's a truth of the confluence of the pandemic and the low
oil prices and the fact that customers continue -- our customers, trucking companies, continue to deliver
freight. And when they're delivering freight, they're putting miles on trucks. And so that bodes well for us
in the future because they're consumable, and over time, we'll need to replace them.

Matthew Youssef Elkott
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That makes sense. And then just one follow-up on the balance sheet side. You don't have manufacturing
debt, but you do obviously go to debt markets in your Financial Services segment. If this economic crisis
intensifies and morphs into a financial crisis, do you think you may have to borrow on your manufacturing
segment for your Financial Services segment?

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers
President & CFO

So you're right. PACCAR has a very strong balance sheet with $4.3 billion in cash, a strong A+/A1 credit
rating and no manufacturing debt, and that is exactly how we like it.

Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

I really just have a quick question around how to think about the Parts business going forward. I think,
obviously, trucks still moving as a positive for the business. But outside of looking at industry truck
utilization, was there anything we should think about around the strong 1Q performance in that business,
dealers building parts inventory given some uncertainty ahead or any color on where you think inventory
levels might be today?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Sure. I think that the most significant factor is the team at PACCAR Parts has done a great job with --
alongside of our dealers of having the right kind of systems in place to support the customers, and so they
become a go-to organization in these times. And they're doing a great job of beating the demand there.
And I think that they're -- obviously, as the situation is dynamic, people were looking at that. And so they
want to make sure that they have parts on the shelf to take care of the customers, and they've done that.
And as we move forward, they're consuming those parts and they'll reorder.

My question is just on your visibility into any future supply chain disruption from all the obvious impacts.
Does that feel like a major uncertainty still? Or is your visibility in the supply chain and how your suppliers
are working, seeing less volatile and less of a disruptive risk?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

You bet. We're working really close with all suppliers, have daily contact with them, and we have a great,
strong supply base. And we choose them for their strength and continue just alignment with them so
that when we restart, they're ready to go and aligned with us being ready to go. So there are daily
conversations. There's nothing that seems unstable right now. It's just making sure they put the best
practices, and care for their people, which they want to do; and align up with the government directives.

Robert Cameron Wertheimer
Melius Research LLC

Okay. That's helpful. And you've made a number of helpful comments on parts. Are you able to say from
telematics or otherwise, how far miles driven or down in April, just to give a sense of real-time pulse of
the economy?

R. Preston Feight

Yes. That's interesting. We do have -- in North America, all of our trucks are connected, so the people
that can work trucks are connected. And we watch vehicle miles traveled, and we watch utilization of the

Robert Hudson Salmon
Wolfe Research, LLC

I guess kind of piggybacking on the adjustments you guys have made to the factories to obviously protect
the employees and respect social distancing. Is there any cost quantification that you can kind of help us
think about whether it's the impact to gross margins? Or kind of incremental cost per piece associated
with the cleaning, with the temperature-taking as well as phasing out employees a little bit more than we
would historically have seen?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

No, there's nothing that's that concrete. Or we'd take the temperatures of the employees -- we're going
to, as they come back into the factories, preproduction, make sure everybody is healthy when they come
to work. That's good for everybody. And then the teams are doing a really good job of just bringing in
safety protocols that work with truck production, and that overlay has gone very well in our factories
where we're starting up.

Harrie C. A. M. Schippers

And like Preston has said, the #1 priority is the safety of our employees. And there might be some costs
associated with that, but that's not the #1 priority.

Robert Hudson Salmon

Yes. Of course, you guys made that very clear, and we'll kind of keep that in mind. As we're looking
forward -- or as we look through kind of the first quarter, can you give us a sense of what the parts

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Loop Capital Management.

Jeffrey Asher Kauffman
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

I guess 2 questions. Number one, following up on what Jamie was asking earlier. The -- is it more a
deferral on CapEx and R&D or more of a structural adjustment, where maybe we're not going to do certain
things? And where do you think, in terms of -- I think Jamie was hinting is the EV movement slowing
down because of low fuel prices and pushing things out. But in terms of looking at R&D programs or
capital spending, where is the flex, and kind of what do you think should be pushed out in this kind of
environment?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Okay. Happy to answer that question with you. So I would say that it's, whether deferred or canceled, we
have a great portfolio of projects. They all have good returns and provide values to our customers. And so
with those projects, often what we're looking at right now is, can we do a phase now? Can we postpone a
phase to a later point? Very few that will cancel. We just look at how well they can be done and how do we
become more efficient at doing them.

And as that lies into the EV movement or autonomous vehicles or connected vehicles, those technologies
continue to be progressing into the truck industry in the coming years, and PACCAR is going to continue
to be a leader in offering EV vehicles to our customers and developing autonomous vehicles, leveraging
partnerships and working with their suppliers and doing in-house development so that we can have all of
those ready when our customers want them, and we'll continue to have that leadership position.

And there are no further questions in queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the
company?

R. Preston Feight
CEO & Director

Yes. I guess I'd just like to close by saying thank you to everybody for the calls. And again, just to
recognize the outstanding people in our company that are doing such a fantastic job. And then also to
recognize those people that are handling and managing and working with the COVID situation around the
world. And our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with them, and we're all going to come through this
stronger in the final analysis.

Operator
And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You
may now disconnect.
