Thanks, Ken
Good afternoon, everyone
As you can see, we had a tremendous quarter in just about every way as cloud revenue, new software license and earnings were all much better than expected
The adoption by our customers of our products and services is at an all-time high
But before going into more detail about Q4, you can also see that we have made significant improvement in our financial reporting to align with how we are running the business now
The cloud has become our predominant growth vehicle
As you can see in our press release supplemental pages, we have given you tons of detail
We have given you the detail in our new presentation format and we have also provided the reporting in our old format going back through fiscal 2016 and 2017. So, you can see the numbers the new way, the old way all including history to help your transition this quarter
I will first walk you through the reporting changes, then go over to Q4 results using the new format and recap Q4 using the old format for comparability to my previous guidance
Then, I will sum up fiscal year ‘17 results using the new additional detail before moving on to my guidance for Q1. So, please be patient as I am going to be giving you a lot in numbers today
But as I said, it’s all in the press release tables that are on file
So, you don’t have to catch every number
After all that, I will turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments
In making these reporting changes, we are now reporting SaaS revenue separately as our tremendous growth resulted in SaaS revenue crossing the $1 billion a quarter threshold in Q4, having grown 76% in constant currency
We have also combined platform and Infrastructure-as-a-Service as the synergies and cross-selling between these two businesses is very high and this is also how we are measuring our internal organization
On Page 10, you can see GAAP applications revenue, which is SaaS and on-premise application software revenues and further down the page GAAP platform and infrastructure revenues, which is the PaaS and IaaS and on-premise revenues
For hardware, we have gone ahead and consolidated hardware products and hardware support into a single line item of hardware
And we have also aligned the expense lines where appropriate
I am now going to go over our non-GAAP Q4 results with our new format and use constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise
This quarter by the way the effects of currency movements resulted in a 1% headwind on both total software revenue, including cloud as well as total revenue
Currency movements had a $0.01 negative impact on non-GAAP EPS and $0.02 negative impact on GAAP EPS
Well, clearly, we are absolutely thrilled with our Q4 results as software and cloud revenues were 4 points above the high-end of my guidance and earnings per share was $0.08 above the high-end of my guidance
As I mentioned earlier, cloud SaaS revenues for the quarter were more than $1 billion for the first time and up 76% from last year
Cloud, PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 45% from last year
You can see the continuing revenue momentum of our cloud business in the cloud billings and deferred revenue
The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $2.4 billion, up 63% in U.S
Cloud billings grew 42% in U.S
dollars this quarter
And once again, we have put the cloud billings number up on our website for you to see the detail this quarter and frankly probably don’t need to keep doing it since many of the numbers you can derive
As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded
The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 65%, up from 54% last Q4. We expect to see further improvement in FY 18 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins over time
Now, the gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 47%, down from 54% last Q4 as we invested in our geographic build-out ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition
When we approach scale, I expect to see improvements in gross margins there too
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 66% from last year
Total on-premise software revenues were $7.5 billion essentially unchanged from last year and while new software license revenues were $2.6 billion, down 4% reflecting the increasing preference of customers for cloud
Software updates and product support revenues were $4.9 billion, up 3% reflecting the continued high attach and renewal rates that showed the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers
Total software and cloud revenues were $8.9 billion, up 7% and 4 points above the high-end of guidance
In addition, the total on-premise software and cloud revenues for both our applications and platform and infrastructure businesses are growing very well now
Applications total revenue were $2.9 billion, up 10% non-GAAP, 8% GAAP, and platform and infrastructure total revenues were $6 billion, up 6% both GAAP and non-GAAP
In particular, our database business in aggregate grew 8%
Hardware revenues were $1.1 billion, down 12% and services revenue were $894 million, up 4%
Total revenues for the quarter were $10.9 billion, up 4% from last year, non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion, up 7% from last year, and the operating margin was 46%, which was up from 45% last year
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20% as we saw some one-time benefits and EPS was $0.89 in U.S
dollars
The GAAP tax rate was 14.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.76 in U.S
dollars
Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was lowered $0.01 and GAAP EPS was lowered by $0.02. Q4 using our old format against my guidance, you can see that SaaS, PaaS revenues were $1.2 billion, up 75% and above the high end of the guidance I gave last quarter
IaaS revenues were $214 million, up 29% and at the high end of my guidance
Now, moving on to the full fiscal year software and cloud revenues totaled $30.4 billion, growing 6% in constant currency with $24 billion or 79% of that being recurring revenue, up from 75% last year
Cloud SaaS was $3.4 billion, growing 70%
Cloud PaaS and IaaS was $1.4 billion, growing 63%
Total cloud revenues totaled $4.7 billion, growing 68%
On-premise software declined 1% to $25.6 billion as the 3% growth rate in software support was offset by cloud related declines in new software license which were down 11%
Hardware revenues were $4.2 billion, declining 10% and services revenue was $3.4 billion, up 1%
Total company revenues for the year grew 3% to $37.9 billion and operating income was $16.2 billion, up 3%
Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43%, up slightly from last year
Non-GAAP EPS – earnings per share were $2.74 in U.S
dollars, up 6%
Because of currency movements non-GAAP EPS was $0.03 lower
Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was – it was $14.1 billion, up 3%
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $525 million
Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.1 billion
I expect our cloud CapEx spending to be about $1 billion next year, roughly equivalent to this year’s level
We now have approximately $66.1 billion in cash and marketable securities
Net of debt our cash position is approximately $8.2 billion
The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially
As we have said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend
In terms of acquisitions, we always have a disciplined approach to finding the right companies at the right time at the right valuation and that make both strategic and financial sense
This quarter we repurchased 11 million shares for a total of nearly 500 million
Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 86 million shares for a total of 3.5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.6 billion
The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share
Now to the guidance, I am going to give you guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for FY ‘18. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency, but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now currency shouldn’t have – should not have an effect on total revenues or EPS
So for Q1 cloud revenues including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow between 48% and 52%
Total revenue growth is expected to range from 4% to 6%
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.59 and $0.61, up from $0.55 last Q1. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%
Of course the tax rate could end up being different
Over the full year of FY ‘18 I expect continued high growth in cloud revenues with cloud revenues materially surpassing new software license revenues
Operating income growth will accelerate and the continued expansion of cloud gross margins and the return of operating margin expansion
Over the last two quarters we exceeded the high end of my EPS guidance by $0.14 and as we begin FY ‘18 our compare is now that much higher
But even with this higher compare, I expect EPS growth will be double digit next year
As I mentioned earlier we will continue to invest in capital in our cloud data centers expansions, but I do expect our overall CapEx will be lower as the CapEx for real estate should be somewhat lower
With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments
So, this is absolutely not a 1-year phenomenon
In fact, what you should see as this goes on is we will have less drag from the transition and the base will continue to grow and so this should really accelerate and understand that in our PaaS, IaaS business, we are not even at scale
So, as we have really scaled that up, profitability is going to increase more quickly and revenues will be built on the base of another recurring revenue – of the recurring revenue business
So, we have been basically turning and we have had the drag of the move away from our historic business to some extent and revenue recognition that’s not upfront, but ratable
Then all of a sudden, you are going to see less of a drag as that side of the business is smaller compared to our cloud business
So, we are obviously very optimistic we indicated to you all during last year this past year that this thing was coming and it has clearly come in Q4. And this next year and years after that are now going to be building on that base
If I could just say one other thing to John, so the issue is really for the folks who have large installed bases of Oracle database and they have done the research of where those workloads should be, they pick Oracle, that’s really what is shown
The folks who could go anywhere and do anything come to us and that’s really the important message
And we are seeing that throughout the customer base and you are going to start to see it in the revenue
Well, let me just talk a little bit about PaaS and IaaS together
The old IaaS was as you know a slower growing business
Our Gen 2 IaaS much faster
PaaS much faster, as it gets, it sort of completely overwhelms the base of our old IaaS
You are going to see acceleration, you must see acceleration, because it is inevitable as we do more and more transactions and bookings, which turn into revenues as people bring their Oracle licenses, their Oracle workloads to us, so you are going to see that’s a very big area
Now, as far as margins, remember in our PaaS business or our IaaS business, the system itself is the same
However, what you see though is that there is enormous value in both our automation and in our technology whether different pieces of software that are in there
And depending on the mix, the margin can be extremely high
We have always – it’s still the Oracle you know in that we watch every nickel around here
And we all sign off on every data center expansion and all the hardware that goes in it
So we really are very, very careful on not getting too far ahead of our revenues, but also benefiting from massive economies of scale
This past year, we did a lot of build-out, for which the revenue has not been showing up yet in the financial statements, but it will be
So, depending on how the different pieces roll in, we expect margins by the time it’s the end of the year, we expect even PaaS, IaaS margins to be better, but we do feel we can do it within our CapEx envelope
Yes, okay
So, SaaS gross margins will continue to increase all of this coming year
We will get closer and closer to my 80 goal by the end of the year
We probably won’t hit 80, but we will be pretty close by Q4 in SaaS margin
So, I think that’s good news
As a result, margins for the entire cloud business will be up quite a bit by the end
So, I am very, very happy upbeat and I expect margins to improve a lot
Hi, Keith
I think this is quite cute
You know I didn’t give guidance on new software license growth, because it’s become less and less relevant
So, I don’t actually intend to give it now, but I will give you a chance to ask another question if you have got one
Absolutely
So as you guys know as I told you we spent quite a bit of money on that suite and so I needed to pay that back
And I have got a couple of quarters of still paying that back and as a general matter we like to buyback quite a lot of our stock, significantly more than at the 500 million a quarter that we have been on since we bought NetSuite
So one side paid all that back, assuming that I don’t buy anything else big, I expect that we will do what we always do which is send the money back to you all, because its your money and so we will buyout your partners and so share repurchases should go up
However, our stock price is going up also, so we may be spending more, but lucky us, lucky all of us stock price is going up which means sometimes I will get less share
So one side pay back NetSuite, I do expect to spend more than 500 million a quarter assuming I don’t buy anything else and anything else really significant
And – but I don’t know how many share I will get back because of course I don’t know what the stock price will be at that time
