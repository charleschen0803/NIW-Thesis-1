Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Sharon, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BorgWarner 2020 First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Nolan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Nolan, you
may begin your conference.

Patrick Nolan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings
release earlier this morning. It's posted on our website, borgwarner.com, on our home page and on our
Investor Relations home page.

Before we begin, I need to inform you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements,
which involves risks and uncertainties as detailed in our 10-K. Our actual results may differ significantly
from the matters discussed today.

During today's presentation, we'll highlight certain non-GAAP measures in order to provide a clearer
picture of how the core business performed and for comparison purposes of prior periods. When you hear
us say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, net M&A and other noncomparable
items. When you hear us say adjusted, that means excluding noncomparable items. When you hear us
say organic, that means excluding the impact of FX and net M&A. You will also -- we will also refer to our
growth compared to our market. When you hear us say market, that means the change in light vehicle
production weighted for our geographic exposure. Our outgrowth is defined as our organic revenue change
versus the markets.

Please note that we posted an earnings call presentation to the IR page of our website. We encourage you
to follow along with these slides during our discussion.

With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Fred.

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our results for the first quarter
and provide an overall company update.

Let me start with the highlights of the first quarter on Slide 5. While the industry production rates were
clearly volatile during the quarter, we performed strongly on a relative basis. With approximately $2.3
billion in sales, we were down about 8.1% organically, and this compares to our market being down
almost 20%. This means we drove significant outgrowth. In fact, for the quarter, we saw double-digit
outgrowth in all major regions.

Our decremental margin was approximately 26% in the quarter, as our margin performance was impacted
by COVID-19-related shutdowns. Given the pace at which the shutdowns occurred, we think this is a
relatively good outcome.

We delivered strong free cash flow of $146 million for the quarter, providing an additional cash cushion as
we manage through the lower production levels expected in the second quarter.

Lastly, I am proud of how the team has reacted to this challenging environment. We met the challenges of
managing orderly production shutdowns at our facilities in Europe and North America while also managing
production ramp-ups in China.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2020

Let's now turn to Slide 6, where you can see our perspective on the global industry production. Overall, we
expect a very challenging environment in 2020, especially in the second quarter. On a full year basis, we
expect the market decline to be in the minus 25% to minus 31% range.

Looking at this decline by region, we're planning for Europe to be down in the 29% to 38% range. In
North America, we expect a 27% to 35% decline. On a relative basis, the outlook for China is stronger as
their shutdown in Q1 was shorter than what we're seeing in the other 2 geographies, but we still expect
18% to 21% decline in China production for the full year.

As you'll see from the line chart showing our different scenarios, Q1 is the quarter which has the largest
expected production declines, and at the same time, the most uncertainty. The biggest drivers for these
declines and the significant uncertainty of the production are the timing of production restarts and the
pace of industry production ramps.

Under our high-end scenario, which is represented by the light green line, we're expecting Europe and
North America production to largely resume by mid-May. Our low-end scenario, represented by the dark
blue line, uses the assumption that Europe and North America will not resume production fully until mid-
June. For both scenario, we expect the second half of 2020 to remain challenged due to lower consumer
confidence.

Visibility into the production outlook has certainly improved versus a month ago, but there is still a
tremendous amount of uncertainty around plant restarts, the pace of production ramp-ups and ultimately,
consumer demand. We're maintaining a very active dialogue with our customers and suppliers in order to
support an orderly production ramp-up and manage effectively through this challenging environment.

On Slide 7, you see the cost actions that we've taken to help moderate the impact of the severe
production declines. This cost action has been across all major areas of the company. We've taken
temporary salary reductions in many locations throughout the world, including 20% pay cuts amongst our
senior executive leadership team. Employees at many of our facilities have been put on temporary layoffs
due to lower production, or in many locations, the complete production shutdown. And we also work with
our strategic third-party relationship vendors who have, in most cases, agreed to share in the economics
of this situation by voluntarily reducing their work or billing rates.

These actions, while, painful, are the right things to do for the financial well-being of our company. I
want to thank all involved, especially our internal team members, who have kept their focus and stronger
engagement despite the sacrifices that have been endured. The industry's next big challenge will be to
successfully manage the production restart.

Let's take a look at how we'll manage this on Slide 8. While we must be ready to supply our customers as
they resume production, we are first and foremost focused on what is best in terms of health and safety
of our people. We've formed a high-level task force that has and will continue to roll out our Safe-Restart
Program to all our global facilities. The program includes a set of 17 minimum standards and 9 additional
recommended best practices. However, our focus on the safety of our people will extend beyond these
standards. We have already seen additional innovative safety solutions developed at the plant level, and
we will continue to utilize and promote this innovation to our other facilities around the globe. It is this
plant level innovation and the appetite to share ideas that is promoted by the BorgWarner culture.

Let's now turn to Slide 9. I would like to briefly comment on our Seneca, South Carolina plant, which was
unfortunately struck by a tornado on April 13. Seneca is one of our largest plants supplying transfer cases
to multiple OEMs in North America. Thankfully, the plant was not in operation at the time of the tornado
struck, but unfortunately, a security guard at the facility was killed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his
family.

Now I'd like to give a status update on the plant. As you can see by the picture on the slide, the level of
damage varied widely. The damage to machining portion of the facility was more limited. However, on
the left side of the picture, you can see the roof of the final assembly area is missing. That assembly area
sustained a more significant amount of damage.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2020

Over the past several weeks, there has been a tremendous amount of remediation work completed. We
have also performed a significant amount of equipment testing and validation, and where appropriate, we
have erected temporary structure. With all of this hard work over the last 3 weeks, I am proud to report
that the facility resumed production on May 4 and that the production rates should improve throughout
the month of May. This was an amazing accomplishment. I would like to personally thank the team in
Seneca for their hard work and our customers for their support. We have turned a terrible situation into a
BorgWarner success story.

Next, I would like to provide an update on our planned acquisition of Delphi Technologies on Slide 10.
This morning, we announced that BorgWarner and Delphi Technologies agreed to an amendment of
the transaction agreement. This amendment effectively cures the breach of the debt covenant that we
asserted at the end of March. Under the terms of the amendment, Delphi Technologies has agreed to new
closing conditions, requiring that at the time of the transaction closing, its gross revolver debt cannot
exceed $225 million and net of its cash balances will not exceed $115 million.

In addition, the parties agreed that Delphi Technology's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio will not exceed
a specified threshold measured at closing. This new closing condition were structured to provide Delphi
with the flexibility it needs to manage through the current environment and execute on its current
forecast. At the same time, they also protect BorgWarner from scenarios that could result in more
significant cash usage or EBITDA deterioration.

The party also agreed to revise the purchase price. In recognition of the potential incremental debt
that could be outstanding at closing, the equity exchange ratio was reduced by 5%. As a result, current
BorgWarner and Delphi Technology shareholders would own approximately 85% and 15%, respectively, of
the outstanding shares of the combined company following completion of the transaction. We are pleased
to put this issue behind us and turn our full undivided attention to driving towards the closing.

In regards to our effort to close on this transaction, there has been a significant amount of other work
done over the past several months. The integration teams continue to work very well together. The
regulatory filings are in process in several geographies. And last week, we closed on a $750 million
delayed-draw term loan to support our potential financing needs at the time of closing. I am pleased with
the progress as we continue to work towards the closing of the transaction in the second half of 2020.

Before I turn it over to Kevin, let me summarize our first quarter results and our outlook on Slide 11.
We achieved significant first quarter outgrowth in all major regions. We delivered positive free cash flow
during the first quarter, and as Kevin will discuss, we expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year.
BorgWarner has one of the most robust liquidity position within our industry. It is this financial strength,
combined with the operational discipline of the company, that will allow us to successfully manage the
challenges we expect throughout 2020.

As I look beyond the challenges of 2020, I am confident that we remain strongly positioned, both from a
financial and technology standpoint to capitalize on the long-term trends that will continue to support our
future profitable growth.

Now over to you, Kevin.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Fred, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financials in detail, I'd like to highlight
2 overarching themes you'll see in our year-to-date results. First, our financials have been quite resilient in
the face of this challenging environment. During the first quarter, we delivered strong revenue outgrowth
in all regions, sustained double-digit operating margins and generated meaningfully positive free cash
flow. Second, our liquidity remains strong and has actually gotten stronger over the course of the first 4
months of this year.

Let's turn to Slide 12. As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q1, you can see the impact from
the thermostat divestiture we executed in early 2019. Additionally, you can see that the stronger U.S.
dollar reduced revenue by about 2% from a year ago. Excluding these items, our organic sales were down

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2020

8.1% compared to the 19.6% decline in industry production. That means we delivered revenue outgrowth
of 1,150 basis points in the quarter. And importantly, that outgrowth occurred in all of the major light
vehicle markets around the globe.

In Europe, our light vehicle organic revenue was down mid-single digits compared to the market decline
of approximately 19%. The outgrowth was driven by better than expected diesel-related revenue as well
as strong new programs. In North America, we were close to flat year-over-year versus the 10% industry
decline, driven by new programs and strong mix. And in China, we outperformed the market by more
than 20% due to the year-over-year growth in our DCT business and other new business. Overall, we're
pleased that we continue to deliver revenue outgrowth even in this challenging end market environment.

Now let's look at our adjusted operating income performance, which can be found on Slide 13. Q1
adjusted operating income was $234 million compared to $295 million a year ago. Our adjusted operating
margin was 10.3%, which was down compared to the 11.5% we delivered in the first quarter of 2019.

On a comparable basis, adjusted operating income decreased $54 million on $205 million of lower sales,
which translates to a decremental margin of 26%. As you know, when markets move downward quickly,
we tend to see initial decrementals that can be 30% or higher, just like we saw at points in time last year.
So we view the 26% as a reasonably good level of performance given how quickly industry production
declined. And we accomplished this objective while increasing R&D expenditures in our Drivetrain
segment, where we're continuing to invest in our electrification portfolio. Adjusted earnings per share was
$0.77 for the quarter. The $0.23 decline in adjusted earnings per share compared to the first quarter of
2019 and was driven by the lower adjusted operating income.

Moving to cash flow. We are proud of the fact that we delivered $146 million of positive free cash flow
for the first quarter. In an environment where revenues are under pressure, it's critical to manage our
working capital effectively. And in the first quarter, we did just that, which is why we were able to deliver
such a great result.

So let's discuss our full year revenue outlook on Slide 14. Our guidance is based on the end market
assumptions that Fred reviewed earlier, with global production being down 25% to 31%. We expect to
continue to drive total market outgrowth for the year, but not at the level we saw in the first quarter. Our
guidance now incorporates full year outgrowth of approximately 400 to 500 basis points. This assumes
our outgrowth for the remainder of 2020 is in the range of 150 to 250 basis points, which is in line with
our prior full year guidance. But obviously, this full year guide is higher than our initial 2020 assessment,
simply given how much we outperformed in the first quarter. As a result, we expect a full year 2020
organic revenue decline of 20% to 27%, and that translates to an expected 2020 revenue range of $7.25
billion to $8 billion.

Let's turn to Slide 15, where you can see an update of our liquidity profile. As of March 31, we had $2.4
billion of liquidity or 24% of 2019 sales. This consisted of our quarter end cash balance of $901 million and
our undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion. You might recall that at the end of December, our revolver capacity
was $1.2 billion, but in the middle of March, we worked with our bank group to increase the capacity to
the new level, thereby bolstering our liquidity by $300 million. It's also important to note that we have a
leverage ratio that is more than 2 turns below the covenant in our revolving credit facility, which means
that we have full, unfettered access to the $1.5 billion facility.

Adding to this, last week, we entered into a 364-day delayed-draw term loan facility, which provides us
with an additional $750 million of liquidity. To be clear, we don't think we need this additional liquidity to
manage through the current environment. Instead, we put this facility in place as an insurance policy to
support any potential financing needs at closing related to a Delphi Technologies transaction. Nonetheless,
the facility is available to us right now prior to any such close, which simply means that we have that
much more liquidity today.

Finally, while we're not providing specific earnings guidance, we did want to give you color on our free
cash flow outlook. In light of our first quarter results and our success thus far in managing our working
capital, we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the full year in the range of $100 million to
$300 million, even in the challenging environment suggested by our revenue outlook. That's a testament

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2020

to the strong financial condition of the company. Our Board's confidence in our financial condition was
evidenced by their decision to maintain our current dividend at this time. However, I would note that given
the current global macroeconomic pressures, we don't expect to be executing on our share repurchase
program in the near term.

So let me summarize my financial remarks. Overall, we had a solid quarter in spite of the industry
pressures, delivering strong outgrowth and positive free cash flow. We expect the markets to remain
under tremendous pressure throughout the year, down 25% to 31% from last year, yet we expect to
deliver positive free cash flow. And finally, we have significant sources of liquidity to manage through this
environment.

As a management team, we are taking the necessary actions to navigate through the current environment
while ensuring the company is strongly positioned for the eventual industry recovery and our future
profitable growth.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pat.

Patrick Nolan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] First question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

It's great to hear from you, and thank you for all the detail and the stab at the outlook for this year. It's
very helpful. Just really a first simple question. As we look at Slide 6, there's some variability that you're
indicating around the second quarter, but we're in the second quarter. So I'm just trying to understand,
Fred, when you were mentioning mid-May restart versus mid-June restart, sort of as some of the
scenarios you're looking at, we're hearing early May, which is what we're in right now for Europe and mid-
May for North America. So that information should be reasonably available to you from your customers.

I'm just curious on schedule releases, what kind of information of lead time you're getting from your
customers that hopefully can eliminate some of that variability and scenario planning? And how much
lead time you expect from them? Because it just seems like some of the stuff should be reasonably well
communicated to you at this moment for the restart.

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

John, there is a wide range of restart date and restart scenario. I think we have to not think about just
the date of restart, but at what level of capacity will it restart. And it is changing daily, both from a restart
date and ramp up production. So I think it still varies, and we still have a lot of uncertainty in Q2 from a
volume perspective.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. So it would be fair to say that you're getting some communication on restart dates, but obviously,
the uncertainty is still flowing down from the customers. So there's still tremendous uncertainty on what
the levels may be starting to even mean at this point. Is that a fair assessment?

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

I think the fair assessment is that we are in constant communication with our customers. And yes, we're
following that very, very closely. And yes, things change. Things do change.

John Joseph Murphy
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I mean the 26% decrementals on the lower volumes
towards the end of the third -- I mean end of the first quarter, it's very impressive. As we think about
sort of the pressure in the second quarter and throughout the year, I mean, is that the kind of number we
should be thinking? Are there any actions that might make that better? Or because you're lower in the cap
U curve, maybe it will be a bit worse? I mean how should we think about sort of bracketing around that
26%, which was very good performance in the first quarter?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think we were pleased with that 26% as well, and that's really a function of the -- a lot of the cost
restructuring actions that we were executing on throughout last year that we announced back in April,
and it allowed us to manage the decrementals now, and we're seeing the benefit of that. And that's even

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2020

while we were investing additional dollars in R&D in the Drivetrain segment. So a good result, all things
considered in this environment.

I think with the pace at which production is coming down on a year-over-year basis, I think it's still
challenging to manage decrementals that are something less than the 30% range in this type of an
environment. I think that's a reasonable directional proxy to think -- how to think about our decrementals
going forward.

Operator

Next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.

Erin Alexandra Welcenbach
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

This is actually Erin Welcenbach on for David. So my first question is just about if you can kind of walk us
through what you're assuming in terms of the Q3, Q4 production scenario that you put on your slide, what
that means in terms of kind of the pace and the cadence of OEM ramp-ups in the back of the year? Any
color on that.

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So we are looking at -- your question is very broad, but let me give you some color here. So on the high
scenario, we're looking at 25% down for the full year. We're looking at a 53% down in Q2, a 16-ish in
Q3 and about 10% in Q4. And the low scenario would be a little bit lower than that, especially in Q2,
as you've seen in the chart on the page that John alluded to. So what matters is really when customer
restarts and how fast they restart. And I'm certainly not going to go customer by customer, but on an
aggregate standpoint, this is where we are quarter by quarter.

Erin Alexandra Welcenbach
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just my second question is, if you can talk about kind of the drivers of
outgrowth in Q1. I mean obviously, you mentioned a number of factors by region, but was there any
impact on kind of stocking or timing benefits in terms of what you're shipping to OEM plants? And could
there be a bit of a delay, I guess, on what you're shipping in early Q2 as that production ramps back up?

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

We don't think it's stocking. And we add in Europe, our Engine Group stronger -- with actually stronger
diesel demand and stronger new small gas engine demand. China DCT was strong. And also strong from
an emissions business standpoint. And our turbo business was pretty strong in North America. So that's
pretty much what drove the significant growth in Q1.

Operator

Next question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.

Daniel V. Galves

Kevin A. Nowlan

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2020

Dan, I think we lost you.

Patrick Nolan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Can you repeat your question, Dan? We lost you.

Operator

We have the next question from Brian Johnson with Barclays.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

A couple of questions. First, could you comment a bit more on the decremental performance? Not only
was it different between Engine and Drivetrain, when we think of the real production impact in the quarter,
it was kind of the month of February in your China operations and then second half of March in North
America, Europe. So if you could give a little bit more color on the decremental margins, maybe ideally by
geography, by division, if you don't want to go that far, at least kind of geographically, so if you begin to
think through 2Q.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

I think I would give it more directionally by the segments the way we disclose publicly. And I mean in
the Engine segment, you can see the simple math says that our decrementals were around 20%. That's
because the bulk of the cost restructuring actions that we've taken over the past year have been in that
segment, and they're getting the benefit of that even as they manage the decremental margins on lower
revenue.

I think you could see in the Drivetrain segment, their decrementals came in, in the low 30s, say, for the
quarter on a year-over-year basis. But the bulk of that was because of the increase in the R&D spend on
a year-over-year basis in that segment to support our electrification program. So if you were to strip out
that increase in the R&D, they would have had decrementals that are in the low 20s.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. I guess what I was getting at is, can we expect worst decrementals in 2Q because of your European
and North American cost structure perhaps being less flexible than that in China?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I think the decrementals are really driven by the pace at which the revenue is down as opposed
to something unique about the geography. So I wouldn't expect that to be the driver of a change in
decrementals. I think just the challenge of operating with significantly lower production, the magnitude of
that decline is really the driver of a decremental that's probably at a higher rate just like we experienced
at points in time last year. I think this year, it's even under more pressure. So something in that 30% ZIP
code is probably the right way to think about us.

Brian Arthur Johnson
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Second question is, we go in the second half. Can you talk a little bit about the -- since you probably
analyzed it, the impact of social distancing, PPE, sort of steps you're going to need to take in the factories
and how that might affect productivity and margins? In particular, do you have kind of operations where it
will be relatively easy as opposed to maybe, say, a credit cut and so for another parts supplier to kind of
keep the kind of protections that work -- that best practices dictate?

President, CEO & Director

Brian, safety is where for BorgWarner excels. We have extraordinary safety results from a TR&I
perspective. And we're using exactly the same excellence that we have built in this company over the past
decade to restart production with safety in COVID-19. So we have done a tremendous amount of work to
figure out how we would restart, plant by plant, including exactly what you said, social distancing, which
is possible but not always, and PPE. But also it goes way beyond the production area also. It impacts the
way people break out, the way people do poses and so on. And all that has been looked at, and our plant
managers have done a terrific job, wonderful job in getting our plants ready to restart.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

And I'd just add to that, Brian. I think that's part of the reason, when we talk about the 30% decremental,
it's a directional guide at this point. It's part of the reason we're not giving specific earnings guidance. I
think there's a lot of variables when you have a revenue range that's from low to high, $750 million wide.
Some of it can be, what is the operational efficiency in the plant? It can be, what are commodity prices
doing? What's happening in the supply base? Are there struggles there? What additional cost actions
might we take? So there's a whole host of things that I think we're going to be learning over the coming
months that will ultimately impact what those decrementals are and how efficient we operate.

Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.

Noah Duke Kaye
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Yes. Okay, great. A 2-part question as you prepare to reramp. First, how would you assess the stability of
the supply base? And two, how are you...

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

I think we lost Noah, too.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Noah, I think we lost you. But...

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

I can answer on the supply base. I would say that we are absolutely clearly seeing that the supply base is
under some kind of undoubtedly some stress. And to date, we have not seen any disruption. But the key
for those Tier 2 suppliers will be their ability to fund a production restart. We are deploying all the best
practices that we've developed when it is around managing supply distress over the past several years.
But I would say that, Noah, that yes, potentially, this is clearly a different scale.

Next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

I think we've had a couple of questions on the decrementals this year. I know it's super, super early. But
as we think about exiting the year, you guys used to give a rule of thumb that essentially incrementals
could be in the high teens when production turns essentially flat to positive.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2020

Could you just maybe help us through -- I think what a lot of us are trying to figure out the increased cost
that comes when production restarts. So even trying for us to model sequential incremental margins, do
you think we'll still be able to achieve high teens into the low 20% when things get better sequentially Q3
into Q4?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

I think that's how we think about it in terms of the way we manage our incrementals and decrementals.
Obviously, right now, we're in the process of managing decrementals in the challenging Q1 as well as Q2,
which will be under even more pressure as you can see from our revenue chart in terms of what we're
expecting from a production standpoint. So right now, we're in the process of managing decrementals,
which means making sure we manage operational efficiency, supplier risk and additional cost actions
that we take to manage in that environment. And then that positions us as we start to see the rebound,
whether you're looking on an incremental -- sequential basis or a year-over-year basis to be able to
deliver at something consistent with our historic guidance of operating in that high teens basis on a ramp-
up.

Christopher Patrick McNally
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then just a technical -- when we're trying to like back solve from maybe juxtapose to
sort of an implied EBIT for the year, can you just talk a little bit about the working capital assumptions?
Are you assuming that you'll have a working capital inflow, which we would sort of expect, given the
production decline?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

That's exactly right. And that's some of the tailwind that we've seen already in Q1 as well as heading
into Q2 because we do run positive working capital. If you look really receivables, payables inventory, we
tend to run in the, call it, around 12.5-ish percent. So I think when you think about the decrementals, we
obviously have real cash flow pressure coming from the decremental, but we also have an offset coming
from free cash flow -- or I'm sorry, from working capital, and we're experiencing that right now.

Now I would say in this type of an environment -- and we all saw this in 2008, 2009, inventory tends to
come out of the system much more slowly. But that said, we still run positive working capital when you
look receivables versus payables. And that's the real benefit that we're seeing at the moment.

A couple other things that you should think about from a cash flow perspective as well is right now, we're
continuing in our planning assumptions, you can see at the high end, to maintain our capital investment at
the levels that we operated with last year. And that's because with a company like us, one of our strengths
is because of our liquidity and free cash flow profile, we can continue to invest in programs in the long
term to support our customer needs. But obviously, that's something we'll continue to monitor as the year
goes on, whether we need to do anything differently there. So I think those are some of the key puts and
takes as you think about cash flow.

Operator

Next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Kevin, just to follow-up on that point, and to be clear that within your free cash flow guidance for the year,
working capital is still a source. Because I would expect there to be some use of working capital as you
have to ramp back up in the back half.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2020

Yes. I mean when you ramp back up, it's a use, but net-net, we're down on a full year basis in each
quarter of the year. And so that allows it to be a pickup when you look at each quarter as well as the
entirety of the year. So yes, working capital is going to be a positive for the year. That's our expectation.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just on the quarter. And I know this is all sort of prior guidance gets thrown out
the window here. But your backlog, I think, previously was $400 million to $530 million. We can mark that
down, obviously, for sort of industry volume assumptions. But in the first quarter, really strong, I think,
over $300 million you guys showed. So did that come in better than you were initially planning? Is some
of that timing? Or maybe you could just talk a little bit more about how some of that backlog rolled in.

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Joe, I think we're very happy with Q1. It was better than expected. We don't think that it's a pull forward
of backlog. But we're not willing to assume that this -- our growth is going to continue at this point. We
are watching especially the diesel demand that was strong versus our assumption in Q1. And also, we're
looking in great detail the China outgrowth.

Joseph Robert Spak
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And Fred, lastly, just on -- back to the supplier stress comment. I mean maybe you could sort
of remind us what Borg has sort of done in the past, but how would you support your supply base to
sort of ensure your supply, if needed? I mean is that just payment terms? Would it be sort of potentially
taking them in? Or are you hoping that some of those businesses will be able to rely on some government
assistance?

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're using the same tools that we've used over the past, I would say, about 2 years when we
started talking about the distress of some of the supply base in Europe. We know how to do it. We have
risk management departments, and we understand all the levers that we can pull. You're right. What's
a bit different now is that you might have some government state help, and we will put this input in
consideration when we decide how we -- what we do and how we do it. One of the key things is really to
stay close to the supply base, close to the customers to understand ramp-ups and link it.

Our next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

James Albert Picariello
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Just curious. Does the current environment affect the timing of your SG&A and COGS, your restructuring
savings and all relative to the cadence you outlined last quarter? Is there a delay or a possible acceleration
in what you can achieve?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

I don't think there's a significant movement one way or the other. We're going to continue to support
funding of the restructuring actions that we identified and talked about back on the January call. In this
environment, there can be some modest movements, just some timing movements, pull forward or even
pushed out a little bit. But that's -- I'd say, overall, directionally, there's not a material change in what we
guided to from the January outlook. We're still proceeding on that path.

BORGWARNER INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 06, 2020

And the good news, I mean, that's -- remember what we talked about when we announced that
restructuring, that set of restructuring initiatives. We were trying to be proactive to manage unforeseen
risks to offset potential unforeseen risk to manage our margin profile. We didn't anticipate COVID-19
necessarily, but here it is. It's one of those unforeseen risks. And the good news is we were out in front of
trying to make sure that we have an ability to sustain our long-term margin profile by taking those types
of actions.

James Albert Picariello
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just based on what you're willing to share, can you just walk through the
rationale on the acquisition amendment, the 5% reduction on the conversion rate? Just curious. What led
you to that number maybe from a valuation standpoint? And I mean, clearly, compared to the original
timing of the announcement, the world has changed pretty dramatically beyond just 5%, let's say. So any
color there would be helpful.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I guess the first thing I'd say about that is we remain confident in the strategic merits of this
transaction. And so all of us see the long-term prospects of combining these 2 companies. And so
remember what the nature of this consent agreement is that we signed up to this morning is to resolve
an issue with an operating covenant. And we view the amendment then as a way to provide Delphi with
the flexibility it needs to execute on its financial plan in this environment while protecting us from further
unanticipated downside risk. The reduction in the equity exchange ratio that we agreed to is intended to
compensate us for that additional risk we're taking by providing that covenant relief.

And remember, the financials of all companies in this environment, BorgWarner included -- BorgWarner,
Delphi, others in this sector, have all been under pressure. And our stock prices reflect that. And since this
is an all-equity transaction, the effective equity purchase price has already been impacted as a result of
the environment we're in. So that's really the totality of how we think about this.

James Albert Picariello
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. Fair enough. That's helpful. And just last one on the strong diesel demand in Europe. This is a
follow-on to the uptick in demand that you saw in the fourth quarter, which I don't think you expected to
continue. So just what's your take on the carryover there?

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're looking at that in great detail. I would not call it a trend. And we're doing that study with a
lot of granularity, but we haven't seen this in registration. So I think it might be also due to the different
element of diesel sizes, and we're more into the big diesels. But I would say that this is something that
this is not a trend that we're ready to bet on yet. Actually, if you look at the penetration rate for diesel, it's
still, in Q1 2020, about 5% lower than Q1 '19. So it has happened, but I'm not ready to bet on the fact
that this could be a trend.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

First question around the -- a clarification around the backlog outlook. So it is close to $350 million in

backlog? In which case is left as $400 million to $500 million or so. So are you assuming no -- limited

amount of new business over the rest of the year? And if that is the case, is that a result of delays or
things that you're seeing? Or is there an element of conservatism in there?

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

We don't see major delays. I would say that Q2 to Q4 are in line with the prior guide, which is 150 to 250
basis points of our growth.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. But was my math -- I don't know if Pat wants to chime in. Was my math right? Like is the 400 -- the
$397 million to $487 million in the 2020 outlook, is that comparable with the $333 million you did in Q1?
Or is that a different thing?

Patrick Nolan
Vice President of Investor Relations

Emmanuel, I'll take you through the backlog math off-line. But just mathematically, the way to think about
it is the outgrowth through the remaining 3 quarters. The average will be that 1.5% to 2.5% that Fred
referenced, which is in line with the prior guide.

Emmanuel Rosner
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Okay. Understood. And then I guess just on the more mid-term basis. So it's encouraging to see
you're not seeing any delays as well as you see the strong outgrowth in the first quarter. From a high-
level point of view, do you think there could be any structural changes in the face of adoption of various
powertrain technologies post-COVID? Like could there be some automakers pulling back on electrification,
if they're not under mandates, let's say, North America or vice versa? Could there be an acceleration of
some other technologies? Do you see anything changing the midterm mix of powertrain as a result of
COVID?

Frédéric B. Lissalde
President, CEO & Director

So the first thing I would say, Emmanuel, is that our strategy of being balanced across CH&E makes it
like, it doesn't really matter for us. What I can tell you is that in China, we are not seeing any slowdown
on electrification programs. We see things moving very fast from an electrification standpoint. In Europe,
we see that the 2025 and 2030 regulatory on CO2 and emission leading to more electrification is not
questioned.

Actually, if you look at it in detail, in some countries, some programs related to electrification were
deemed essential. In the U.S., it might take a little bit more time. But the U.S. will benefit from our great
technology in a combustion standpoint, making engine cleaner and leaner. And wherever we are around
the world, we will see electrification accelerating growth for BorgWarner and also a great product in
combustion making customers happy when they decide to go and have a longer tail in combustion.

Next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley.

Armintas Sinkevicius
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Looking at the exchange ratio here with Delphi, I understand it compensates for the additional relief that
Delphi is looking for. But on the other hand, you mentioned that you don't expect to be executing on the
share repurchase program in the near term. And part of that transaction was adding some additional share
buyback. So just trying to think through the implications for share buybacks and why you didn't try to take
that into account with the exchange ratio.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

I mean with respect to the share buyback, we remain committed to the $1 billion program we announced
back at the end of January. I think all we're saying is that in the near term, in this environment, with
all the uncertainty that we have, we don't think it's the prudent decision to be deploying liquidity at
this moment to start executing on that program. We're subject to a number of blackouts anyway in the
environment where we're operating in as a result of where we stand in the transaction with Delphi. But
nonetheless, I think just in the coming months, we don't think it's prudent to be executing on that. That
said, we remain committed to the $1 billion program.

Operator

That question comes from Dan Levy with Crédit Suisse.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. First, we've seen others cut their own share buybacks and dividends to preserve cash. What's the
rationale for why you've maintained your dividend? I mean I saw you had 0 buybacks in the quarter, but
you had the dividend in place. So why keep that?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean ultimately, the dividend is a decision of the Board of Directors. But I think the way we as a
management team think about it is the dividend is a commitment that we make to returning free cash
flow to our shareholders, and generating $146 million of free cash flow in the first quarter with an outlook
that suggests that even under these difficult revenue scenarios that we're going to generate positive free
cash flow for the full year. I think the Board undoubtedly took that into consideration and thought it was
good to continue to live up to its commitments to returning that cash flow to shareholders. Undoubtedly,
that's a decision the Board will continue to monitor each quarter as it looks at the environment and sees
how things might be changing, but I'm sure that was the calculus that went into it.

I think with respect to buybacks, buybacks, we remain committed, as I mentioned to Armintas, to the
$1 billion program, but the timing of the execution of those tends to be more discretionary. And so we're
going to be prudent with the liquidity in this environment and look at the right timing to start redeploying
the cash towards that buyback program, but we don't think now is the moment to do that.

Dan Meir Levy
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And just a follow-up on the deal with Delphi. Assuming everything goes forward, you'll close the
deal in a different world than what we saw at the time the deal was announced. And Delphi is probably
going to be coming in with higher leverage. So how does the higher leverage ratio change the way that
you think you will operate the go-forward entity? Is there maybe -- are you going to have to be more
aggressive on restructuring? Or would you have to adjust spend in different areas? So how does leverage
change the calculus for how you think you may need to operate the go-forward entity?

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Keep in mind, when Fred talked through this slide, what we agreed to with Delphi as part of this consent
agreement is to put a limitation on the amount of debt that can be outstanding at the closing. And in the
grand scheme of things, when you think about that potential for incremental indebtedness, we don't think
it materially alters our view on the expected leverage ratio or the financial prospects of the combined
company.

Okay. So still the entire entity as a whole is still intact with this new requirement in place.

Kevin A. Nowlan
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I mean remember, Delphi has, call it $1.5 billion or so of debt. We have a couple billion dollars of
debt. And we talked about the potential -- not the requirement, but the potential that there could be
additional net debt at closing of $115 million according to the consent agreement we signed up for. So in
the grand scheme of an entity that has $3 billion-plus in debt, that's not a huge number that really swings
the overall leverage prospects of the company in a way that causes us to want to operate it any differently
post closing.
