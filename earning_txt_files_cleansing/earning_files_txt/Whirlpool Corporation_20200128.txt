WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Call.
Today's call will be recorded.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor
Relations, Roxanne Warner. Please go ahead.

Roxanne Warner
Senior Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track
with the presentation available on the Investor section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.

Before we begin, I'll remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking
statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results
could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other
periodic reports. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We
believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not
be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will
provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are
directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website
for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

[Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 3, we show our fourth quarter 2019 highlights. We
delivered very strong results: organic net sales growth of 1.2% and ongoing EBIT margin expansion to
7.2%, a 100 basis point increase. We demonstrated a strong performance across the globe as all regions
delivered positive EBIT.

North America led with record EBIT margins of 13.3% despite industry demand softness in the U.S. and
Canada. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we continued to realize the full benefits of our
strategic actions. This represents the second consecutive quarter of sequential EBIT improvement in the
European region, providing a strong confidence in our ability to drive a region to profitability in 2020.

Additionally, we delivered strong free cash flow of over $900 million, with positive contributions from all
regions. This result was driven by working capital improvements and capital spend efficiencies. Lastly, we
continue to strengthen our balance sheet and made strong progress towards our long-term gross debt-to-
EBITDA target of approximately 2.

Turning to Slide 4. I will discuss our full year highlights. We delivered record ongoing earnings per share of
$16, above our $14.75 to $15.50 guidance, with a very strong ongoing EBIT margin expansion of 60 basis
points and free cash flow of over $900 million compared to guidance of approximately $800 million.

We took decisive actions in a challenging environment by announcing and successfully executing on our
global cost-based pricing initiatives and driving positive mix through product innovation. Additionally, we
remain disciplined in our approach to cost takeout and continue to optimize our overall value chain while
overcoming significant headwinds from tariffs and material cost inflation.

Despite significant trade and macroeconomic challenges, we fully funded our business investment needs
and returned strong levels of cash to shareholders through continued share repurchases and increased our

WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

dividend for the 7th consecutive year. These results demonstrate the fundamental strength of our business
and provide us confidence that we have the right strategy in place to deliver our long-term goals.

Turning to Slide 5. We show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year margin expansion. In the fourth
quarter, price/mix delivered 100 basis points of margin expansion as we realize the benefits of pricing
actions and mix benefits from our product launches. Additionally, we delivered positive net cost takeouts
in the quarter. Further, improving trends in raw materials more than offset continued tariff headwinds in
North America, resulting in a favorable impact of 25 basis points. These margin benefits were partially
offset by continued marketing and technology investments and the unfavorable impact of currency.

Over full year, very strong margin expansion from price/mix was partially offset by the impact of tariffs,
increased brand investments and currency. Overall, we're very pleased to deliver and even slightly
overdeliver on our margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive
strong results in 2020.

Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results.

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review the fourth quarter results for
our North America region. We delivered stable revenue despite industry softness in the U.S. and Canada,
highlighting the agility and underlying strength of our business. Additionally, we delivered record EBIT with
margin expansion to 13.3% as strong price/mix execution and disciplined cost takeout offset headwinds
from fixed cost leverage and continued cost inflation. The region drove margin improvement of 150 basis
points in the quarter, making it the ninth consecutive quarter of consistent margin expansion.

Turning to Slide 8. We review the fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region.
Excluding business exits, unit volumes were approximately flat, with growth in Italy, France and Eastern
Europe, which was offset by soft Middle East and Africa demand. We are pleased to see strong top line
exit rates in December across the region, including year-over-year growth in Middle East and Africa.
Momentum from our cost reduction and strategic initiatives delivered positive EBIT with margin expansion
of 210 basis points. These initiatives remain fully on track and delivered in line with our guidance of
approximately $100 million EBIT benefit on an annual basis, with approximately $75 million to be
realized in 2019. This sustained improvement provides us confidence in our ability to return the region to
profitability in 2020.

Now we turn to Slide 9 to review the fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Unit volumes
significantly increased alongside a rebound in Brazil industry demand, offsetting continued weakness
in Mexico. Organic net sales, which excludes 2018 Embraco sales, increased approximately 17% driven
by Brazil share gains and very strong direct-to-consumer sales. EBIT margins contracted in the quarter
as cost productivity benefits and favorable raw material inflation were more than offset by currency
devaluation in Brazil and Argentina. Finally, as a reminder, our fourth quarter 2018 results include the
impact of the Embraco compressor business in its consolidated results.

We now turn to the fourth quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on Slide 10. Excluding
the impact of currency, net sales were approximately flat as strong top line growth in India was offset by
negative industry demand in China. India delivered double-digit EBIT and continued share gains, which
was offset by brand transition investments in China. These investments remain on track with Whirlpool
brand share increasing sequentially and year-over-year.

Now I'd like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance and operational priorities.

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 12. We'll review our guidance assumption for 2020. In line with our long-
term goals, we expected to drive organic net sales growth of approximately 3%. We expect to deliver
approximately 7.5% ongoing EBIT margin, an increase of about 60 basis points. Lastly, our free cash flow

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

guidance is $800 million to $900 million, which includes a net unfavorable impact of $140 million from
onetime items.

Turning to Slide 13. We show the drivers of our approximately 7.5% ongoing EBIT margin guidance in
2020. We expect approximately 25 basis points of improvement related to price/mix as we deliver new
and innovative products and services to our customers. We expect net cost to drive approximately 50
basis points of improvements as we realize the benefits of our global standardization and complexity
reduction initiatives. Additionally, based on what has been announced to date, we do not expect tariffs
to have a year-over-year impact on 2020 results. A favorable trend in raw materials are expected to
drive approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion. Further, we expect a negative margin impact
of approximately 50 basis points as we continue to invest in our digital transformation journey and an
unfavorable impact from currency of approximately 25 basis points.

Moving to Slides 14 and 15. We want to highlight just a few of our innovative products which allow us to
drive positive price/mix during 2020. The first slide shows how we will achieve product leadership in the
North America premium top load laundry segment. These products will launch throughout the first quarter
of this year, replacing our entire premium top load laundry segment. These connected capable products
have purposeful innovation to meet customer needs such as Load & Go dispenser, a new pretreat station
and an extra power function.

Second example on Slide 15 highlights our new dishwasher built in our first-ever true global architecture,
which is set to launch in North America and Asia in the first quarter and at a later stage in Europe. By
leveraging our architecture globally, we are able to drive significant improvement in part and complexity
reduction, therefore driving cost efficiencies. Even more importantly, this innovative product features a
new full-sized third rack with a fully functioning spray arm, the largest third rack available in the market.
We fully expect to see major growth in our mass and premium segments as a result of these innovative
consumer-relevant features. Again, these are just a few examples of exciting innovations that we expect
to launch this year that will continue to drive positive price/mix.

Now I'll turn it back to Jim to highlight a few remaining guidance items.

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Marc. Turning to Slide 16. We expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $16 to $17 in 2020.
Our ongoing tax rate is expected to be 20% to 25% compared to 15.3% in 2019, resulting in a year-over-
year headwind of approximately $1.55. A European tax law change in late 2019 favorably impacted our
effective tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our tax rate would have been near the midpoint of our previous
guidance. Additionally, several of our tax reform benefits and strategies from prior years are no longer
effective in 2020, further increasing our rate to our current 20% to 25% range.

Secondly, as we mentioned earlier, we expect to drive EBIT margin expansion in all regions totaling
approximately 60 basis points, resulting in strong earnings accretion. Our earnings per share guidance
includes a headwind of $0.60 as 2019 EBIT includes approximately $50 million related to Embraco.
Additionally, we expect moderately lower interest expense after the repayment of our $1 billion term loan
in 2019.

Lastly, we highlight the carryover benefit from our 2019 share buybacks. While we expect to continue to
repurchase shares at a moderate level, we do not provide specific guidance for 2020 and do not reflect
that as a driver.

On Slide 17, we show our regional guidance for the year. Starting with industry demand, we maintain our
cautious demand outlook for North America while U.S. housing starts show positive signs of strengthening
that has not yet translated into higher appliance demand. In EMEA, we expect a continuation of modest
growth, while in Latin America, we expect growth of 3% to 4% as improvements in Brazil are offset by
continued weakness in Mexico. Asia industry is expected to be approximately flat as growth in India is
offset by continued demand pressure in China. In total, we expect the global appliance industry to be
approximately flat for 2020.

WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Regarding our EBIT guidance, we expect continued margin expansion in North America, driven by focused
cost discipline and favorable price/mix related to new product introductions. In EMEA, we fully expect
to continue to realize the benefits of our strategic actions to restore EMEA to profitability, resulting in
EBIT margin expansion of over 170 basis points. As a reminder, we executed several strategic actions,
including our business exits in the first half of 2019, driving benefits primarily in the second half. In
Latin America, we expect to deliver EBIT margins of approximately 6% as demand improvements and
accelerating direct-to-consumer sales in Brazil are offset by demand weakness in Mexico and currency
devaluation in Argentina and Brazil. Lastly, we expect to achieve EBIT margins of 3% to 4% in Asia as
strong India operations are partially offset by weak demand expectations in China. In total, we expect
to deliver approximately 60 basis points of margin improvement and are confident that our operational
priorities and initiatives will deliver continued progress towards our long-term goals.

Turning to Slide 18. I will discuss the drivers of our 2020 free cash flow. We expect to deliver
approximately $1.7 billion in cash earnings, primarily driven by margin expansion, offset by the sale
of Embraco. We expect $550 million in capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our business.
Additionally, we expect to deliver approximately $50 million of working capital improvement, primarily
through inventory reduction initiatives as we fully transition key product launches across the globe. And
we expect $200 million of restructuring cash outlays, which includes the reindustrialization of our Naples,
Italy manufacturing facility. Lastly, free cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately $140 million
related to several onetime items. Further details of these items can be found in the appendix of this
presentation. In total, we expect to deliver $800 million to $900 million of free cash flow.

Turning to Slide 19. We provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for the year. We remain
fully committed to funding the business for growth while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and
return cash to shareholders. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation, we repurchased
approximately $50 million of shares in the fourth quarter and expect to continue repurchasing shares
at moderate levels in 2020. In line with guidance at Investor Day, our gross debt-to-EBITDA is on track
towards our long-term target of approximately 2.

Lastly, I'd like to announce that starting in April, we will no longer report units sold in our earnings
materials, including our 10-K and 10-Q. As we continue to redefine what product is, this will lead to an
increase in revenue from products not reported as units, such as the KitchenAid Smart Oven plus baking
stone and the upcoming launch of Yummly's wireless smart thermometer. Further, we continue to invest in
our digital transformation journey and unlock long-term value creation through incremental revenue from
digital products and services such as our Yummly Pro subscription service. As a result, units are becoming
less of an indicator of our overall sales performance. Consequently, we will eliminate units reporting in our
earnings materials, including our 10-Q and 10-K.
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I wanted to start out just a couple of questions around North American volumes and maybe a follow-up
about your last comment on, Jim, around units. But just in the quarter, with volumes a bit weak, it seems
like on the major appliance side, a little below what AHAM said. And then I think we all were expecting
some rebound in small appliance shipments just given the timing shifts you had indicated last quarter.
Can you talk us through just the inventory dynamics potentially at your trade partners, both in major
appliances and small appliances and how we should be thinking about what happened in the quarter and
maybe how that's progressing into 2020?

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

So Mike, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me comment on then our volume Q4, which, as you know, in total we
reported a 3.8% unit decline for North America. Now keep in mind, first of all, on the pure majors
business, and if you want to take one indication, the AHAM numbers were minus 1.8 for the quarter,
which, just to remind everybody, does not encompass the entire spectrum of what we sell. So that's, of
course, one part of that. If you look at the pure majors business, we approximately held market share in
Q4. So we feel pretty good about where we are from a market share, in particular, during the promotional
period.

On the other parts of the business, keep in mind, Canada is in there. Canada continues to have a market
decline, and the Canadian market is soft and that has an impact. On the SDA volume, frankly, coming into
the quarter, we did expect that the trade brings inventories back to normal levels around the end of the
year, and they didn't. So the trade inventories on the SDA side are lower than the year before. But we
feel very good about the sell through KitchenAid SDA, which is pretty solid and pretty stable. So these are
pretty much the major components.

And maybe, Jim, you want to comment again on the units reporting?

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Mike. And then on the units reporting, as I mentioned, as we look at our business globally, there are
a lot of parts of the world where services and other consumables, products that aren't normally included
in our unit count are an increasing part of our sales. So we typically look at a unit as something that has
a power cord attached to it. And a lot more of the stuff that we sell now today, whether it be stand mixer
attachments, it be licensed products, it be, as I mentioned, consumables or services just don't fall into
there. And so we felt it was a much less relevant indicator, while revenues is a better indicator of how
we're doing on a global basis.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. And that was actually going to be my second question. Just -- is there any way you can size up
those components just before you kind of transition to the new reporting? Just give us a sense of what
those represent today by either in aggregate or by a major region.

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

8

WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Yes. I'd say right now that we don't disclose those specifically by region and all that. As we said, it's
becoming more a part of our ongoing sales. And I think as we switch to this new model, we'll look at what
relevant measures we think we should be communicating.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First question I had was just on the competitive backdrop in North America. There's been a lot of chatter
and concern, as there always is perpetually. But given the past year with the ramp of the LG and Samsung
lines, we've gotten a lot of questions around how that may or may not have affected the competitive
dynamics. I was hoping you could comment on your view of the promotional environment in the fourth
quarter. Seasonally, there's always, I think, a lift in the fourth quarter. But if you could comment on how
that trend has been maybe year-over-year, and if you view anything related to the ramp-up of those
plants as having contributed to that at all.

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

So Michael, it's Marc. As you mentioned already, with question around the competitive background in
North America, they are almost a perennial question, so i.e., they have been around for the last 10 years.
And in the last 10 years, we expanded our margin on a consistent basis in North America. So we -- of
course, it's an intense competitive environment. But I think we've also impressively demonstrated that we
can expand margins despite a highly competitive environment.

In particular, when it comes to the onshoring of the 2 washing machine factories, as we always said, we
welcome that because it's mainly a level playing field, and we feel very confident that we can compete
in that environment. So as such, no, we did not see a negative impact on the broader competitive
environment from the onshoring of their production. I would say it's pretty much the same intense
environment.

Particularly, as it relates to your question around the promotional environment, yes, in Q4, we saw a slight
uptick on promotional intensity, particularly from 2 competitors but not the entire marketplace. And that
doesn't entirely surprise us. But we've also seen that despite a broader market contraction, we delivered
13.3% EBIT margin in North America, which demonstrates that even in a promotional environment, even
with the declining markets, we are able to deliver very, very strong margins.

Michael Jason Rehaut
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Right. So no, I appreciate that, Marc. And maybe just to dive in a little bit more as my second question on
the North American margins, which obviously is very, very impressive. If you could give us any sense of
the -- perhaps just being a little more granular around the drivers of that 150 basis point year-over-year
improvement. In particular, obviously, you have the price/mix component. And I'm also curious about cost
productivity. What's driving that bucket? And what was the contributor there particularly as, obviously, you
don't have any additional volume leverage to take advantage of? So really, what was driving that other
bucket?

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Michael. This is Jim. Let me maybe start a little bit with that. I'd say for North America, the margin
expansion was driven by similar levers to what we said globally. And so there's not a significant difference
there. We did obviously have positive price and mix within North America within the quarter. From a net
cost perspective, we also began to see some cost progression there. And what we're seeing is, one, as we
talked about going into 2020, a reduction in headwinds in terms of what we're seeing on materials. Tariffs

WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

were very stable within the quarter. So that was positive for us. And then we did make some investments
similar to what you see on our walk for the whole quarter.

So there's nothing unusual within North America outside of what we demonstrated globally, that it was
really pricing and mix and then a positive cost environment that offset some of the cost headwinds we had
to deal with.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Just start off with can you talk a little bit about inflation, and how you're seeing steel prices and other kind
of key inputs as we think about 2020?

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, Susan. So when it comes to inflation, and let me first repeat what we said several times, we --
coming into 2019, we basically had a cumulative inflation of around $700 million in our business. That
is the result of raw materials, tariffs, cost inflation throughout the entire value chain, in particular, in
logistics. That was still in total headwind pretty much throughout mid-year 2019. And as of Q3, and in
particular Q4, we saw that slowly coming around in terms of a total net cost takeout.

If you break it down more in terms of the external factors on this one, yes, we saw globally a turn of the
raw materials pretty much around Q3 and then more impact in Q4. And as you've seen in our guidance
for 2020, we also expect another improvement on the raw material side. What has changed since our
last earnings call is our outlook on the tariffs because in the last outlook we had to work with what was
announced at that time. And based on what we know today now, the tariffs will not have a negative year-
over-year impact. And as a result of that, we basically see this 0.5% margin expansion just coming from
better raw materials.

The other inflation elements like logistics or other cost elements, so far, we don't see yet turning around.
So that is still working against us, and that's what we're trying to address. But again summarizing, I
would describe 2020, we will see less of an inflationary environment, but it's not completely gone and it's
certainly not reversed. And it's obviously our key operational priority to kind of double down and really
improve our cost takeout throughout the entire system.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then just turning to your EMEA business. Can you talk to how much of the
improvement in the margin this quarter came from kind of the core business and maybe your improving
position within that relative to some of the benefits of the restructuring actions that you've taken there?

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

Susan, I think it's pretty balanced. I mean at the end of the day, it's the combination of all these
measures. Keep in mind, the biggest actions which we drove pretty much for the last several quarters
is the fixed cost takeout, the kind of exit of certain non-core businesses like Turkey, like South Africa
and Hotpoint, small domestic appliances, and the refocus of investments and driving growth in our core
markets. And frankly, I would say we delivered on all 3 of these levers. So I think it's a combination of
these ones which drove the year-over-year improvement.

But in particular, when it comes to the core markets, and this may be -- is embedded in our overall unit
number which we have for Europe, we had in our core markets growth in Q4. And that's a good thing. So

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

we stabilized or regained market share in most of our core markets. And again, that's a very encouraging
sign as we look into 2020.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.

Samuel John Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

A couple of questions, if I could. First, you're mentioning expectations for flat industry units globally and
also a 3% organic sales growth expectations. I'm trying to figure out the rank or the reasons for the
outperformance in sales dollars you expected in fiscal '20 versus the flat industry shipments. I'm guessing
some of that's the DR Horton win. I'm guessing some of that's price/mix. But if you could help rank what
are the drivers of that gap, Jim.

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Sam, here's what I'd probably start with is, if you look at it, what we would say is demand being flat
globally. Obviously, we do believe we'll have some share wins in certain markets around the world, and
you pointed to some of the specific examples in North America. But I think also, as Marc just talked about,
within EMEA, we also expect to gain back some of the share we lost there. So that will help drive us from
a revenue perspective despite an industry being flat globally.

The second thing is, as we mentioned, there's an incremental amount of price/mix in there, which also
does help us on a revenue base. We assume that to be slightly positive for the year. So both of those, that
would probably be the second biggest driver that I would say.

Samuel John Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And then my second question, the net cost benefit of 50 basis points in 2020, that's obviously
constructive. But I think it's still below where you'd like to be ideally, at least from a productivity
standpoint. Are you still anticipating having production below shipments in fiscal '20? I know you
mentioned inventories maybe being down a little bit, but that sounded more like efficiencies than it did
production cuts. So if you could talk about production expectations versus shipments, please?

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

I can take that, Sam. First of all, on a full year basis, as you pointed out, we're certainly not planning
on a net cost takeout to have benefit from volume leverage. Or put it differently, we're not going to
increase production beyond the sales forecast. We're actually -- contrary, we're planning to take out
further inventory when we have some opportunity. However, I would say that is not a huge item in there.
It's a small negative in the cost takeout efforts.

But the other element is we still have logistics costs which are elevated throughout the world. That is still
a factor. The good news is we're making good progress on the fixed cost takeout in Europe and some other
parts. We see some benefits from our global product architecture, so it's all coming to materialize. And
yes, internally, our job over time is to tackle it more, in particular with the supply chain and logistics costs.

Samuel John Darkatsh
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

So long term, what should that net cost number be as opposed to the 50 basis points?

I mean -- and again it's -- Sam, I would come back to what we said at the Global Investor Conference.
Our aspiration will be, yes, 0.5 point to 1 point should be the net cost takeout, absent of raw material
impact. And that's kind of the long-term expectation we should have of a business of our size.

Your next question comes from the line of Curtis Nagle from Bank of America.

Curtis Smyser Nagle
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So the first one would be just trying to understand what is driving the view that North America demand
or unit demand will be higher this year versus last, given things like the replacement cycle and housing
obviously being late-stage and then I think your commentary that we haven't seen much of a push up
from that. So I'm just trying to reconcile, yes, again how to think about this year versus last?

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

So Curtis, let me -- again, on North America, first of all, to repeat the numbers, we expect North America
industry to be somewhere between minus 1% and plus 1%, so pretty much flat year-over-year. As you
know, they are basically simplified by 2 major components in the industry demand: one is the replacement
demand; we have one which is somewhat related to housing or remodeling. On the replacement, and
that's a little bit the same like last year, we're now comping against the low years post-recession. And that
had been around us for the last 1 or 2 years and probably will be around us for another year or so, just
because you're comping against these low years. And that was already a factor in 2019.

Coming into 2019, frankly, we expected more momentum coming out of housing. And of course, the --
and then again, we're now -- going back in time, Q4 '18, the weak housing impacted what we sold in the
housing-related market in 2019. So the housing was, I would say, a little bit on the softer side compared
to what we originally expected coming into 2019.

As you turn the page in 2020, I would say we're reasonably optimistic on housing, but we just want to
wait and see. What I mean with that is the initial data points which we got in December from housing
were, in fact, very encouraging. But it's the first positive data points, and we want to see that stabilizing.
I would also add when you look at the news from homebuilders, these were, in fact, very strong and very
encouraging signs. But I also want to remind everybody, between an order of a new house and the actual
appliance shipment, you typically have 9 to 12 months. So the good signs which we see now on the order
side, it takes a while until it shows up in our revenue line. So -- but I would say, if housing stabilizes and
sees more positive trends that we've seen in December, I would say that spells good news for our industry
in first.

Curtis Smyser Nagle
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Understood. And then just as my follow-up, yes -- I mean, I guess, how should we think about
restructuring costs, and I guess, kind of the path going forward? A commentary from you guys is -- for a
few years from now is we should expect that to kind of tick down. This year, it's going to be elevated, and
I understand for, I guess, what I'll call a onetime item. But past 2020, do you guys still think we will see a
tick down? Or how should we think about it?

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Curtis, this is Jim. And what I'd say is we expect to be, from a P&L perspective, at $100 million of
restructuring costs this year. And most of that is related to the already announced action we're taking
around our Naples factory within EMEA. So that's also -- the $100 million is about the run rate you should
expect better or less on a go-forward basis.

WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

What we do have within this year is we still have assumed $200 million of cash outlays for restructuring.
And that's just some of the ongoing projects that we have, including Naples. That's the finalization of
those, but we've already taken the P&L charge for those. But somewhere $100 million or less than that is
what you really should think about on an ongoing basis that we'll see.

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

Curtis, it's Marc, and let me also echo what Jim is saying. And again stepping back in time, post the
acquisitions which we did and also post-recession, we had several years where we had restructuring
$150 million to $200 million or north of $200 million. And rightfully, many of you asked, when is that
coming down? So I would say 2020 is now the first significant year where we basically take it down to
$100 million. And again, to Jim's point, the cash is following it over time, but the charge, as such, will be
$100 million. And I would say 2020 is the first significant year where you see a significant reduction in
restructuring and that, I think, should be a trend going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Congratulations on the quarter. That was a good quarter overall. I guess just on Europe, just to go back to
an earlier caller's question on Europe and just looking at your 2020 EBIT guide of 100 to 150 basis points.
How much of the expected improvement is related to a full year of the savings that you've delivered so far
versus how much is related to top line drivers like listing growth and favorable mix?

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'd say, David, if you start off -- what we said that actions we took deliver about $100 million on a
run rate basis. And we really realized about $75 million of that so far, so there's about an incremental $25
million that will come within next year from those actions we've already planned. And then additionally,
we've got other continuing cost takeout initiatives that we've entered into there and we continue to drive.
We have, as I mentioned, the action around the Naples factory that at some point in time -- well, we don't
expect it to be a significant benefit within 2020. It will be from an ongoing perspective. And then as I
mentioned earlier, really, volume lift or regaining some of the market share in some of our key markets is
what we see as the opportunity that will then close the gap in terms of that margin progression there.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

I don't want to get cut off because I've got a second question. But if I could just add -- ask you to
elaborate on the answer you just provided in just how much of a drag on the segment EBIT was the EMEA
business?

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

David, the EMEA business was a drag throughout pretty much Q3. As you know, we had some issues
around recertification against the new industry standards. But EMEA in Q4 was pretty much in line with
where we historically had and where we should be. But it was a drag pretty much until September. So
it's about a little bit drag on a full year basis. So yes, I would say that is a further leverage of -- a lever
for further operation and organic improvements in 2020 because you're just now comping against our 3
quarters.

WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Right. Right. Okay. And then my follow-up question, I guess, with respect to the North American business,
I guess, there's a lot of questions in the market today regarding -- you've got negative North American
units. The working capital certainly was below the guide that you discussed on your October call. You
had -- revenues were generally flat, and you put up some pretty impressive margins. I guess within the
revenue growth math, can you talk about how strong is the mix? And just how confident are you that the
mix will remain strong through 2020?

And I guess, you've got a lot of innovation in the market right now. Is this a matter of just we had a good
year in mix and then we ended up against some pretty tough mix comps? Or are we in the beginning of
maybe a 2-, 3-, 4-year stretch driven by innovation and a very strong mix contribution to the P&L?

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

So David, I'm -- overall, I would say in Q4, first of all, it was driven -- the pricing was driven by, yes, our
continued discipline in line with our established policy around promotional participation would create the
value. But second of all, to your point, it's product mix where we started, I emphasize, started leveraging
some of the product innovation. And that's also the reason why we showed earlier in the script there are
kind of 2 major new product ones because they're both impacting North America. So -- and that's why
we're confident we will have good mix, solid mix across brands, across products, also on a go-forward
basis. And that is our big opportunity.

Your next question comes from the line of Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just given all the moving pieces in free cash flow, what do you think the right way to think about long-
term EBITDA to free cash conversion is?

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

Well, as we've always said, we see our long-term free cash flow goal around 5% to 6% of sales. So as we
begin to exit this year, I think you start to look at a conversion that begins to get into the 85%-plus area.
And again, I think 2020, as we mentioned, we still have some key onetime items that we need to do such
as some legal settlements and other things. But once you get beyond that, we do expect to be in that 5%
to 6% of sales as a free cash flow percentage.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Sure. And that's, you think, starting in 2021?

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

In 2021, I'd say we're going to get -- we will get much closer to there, and there will be a progression
as you go through over the next few years. But most of these items, as we mentioned, coming out of
2020, our restructuring cash outflows will be less and we'll have some of these, whether they're legal
settlements or product actions that we had to take behind us. And so we do feel confident that our free
cash flows will begin to reflect that stronger performance.

Seldon T. Clarke
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then I know you manufacture the majority of your appliances in the U.S., but do
you anticipate any major impacts to production stemming from this coronavirus outbreak, whether it be
related to Whirlpool specifically or just the industry more broadly?

WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 28, 2020

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

Seldon, it's Marc. I would say at this point, the answer is no, we don't expect a major impact. So to
elaborate a little bit on this one, and first of all, it's kind of -- our biggest concern is right now around our
people. But so far, it looks like all our 10,000 people are safe and healthy. Beyond this one is -- of this
coronavirus, from what you can see today, it may have 3 potential impacts: One is the China domestic
market. Obviously, when people don't go into stores, the market will decline. You all know that our
exposure to the China domestic market is limited. So yes, that's not going to hurt us a whole lot.

Two is then on production and three is on components. Production, China production is largely serving
Asia; and to only a lesser extent, Europe; and to almost a very small extent, North America.

As you know, North America, 80% of what we sell in North America or in U.S. is produced in U.S. So the
bad exposure is somewhat limited, in particular with 1 factory where we export from China. It's almost
a thousand miles away from Wuhan. So we're a little bit, I won't say protected, but it's a little bit further
way.

The third element is components. Keep in mind, this whole thing happens around the Chinese New
Year. Every year around Chinese New Year, you plan with your supplier inventory levels, when they stop
production, when they start production. I would say we're pretty well covered. We're also well covered
for this 3 or 4 days of extension for Chinese New Year. And beyond this one, we got to see. And the
other thing which you also need to keep in mind, throughout the last couple of years, the most critical
components, we went aggressively for dual-sourcing. So we're not -- we're single-sourced only in very,
very few components. We're largely dual-sourced, which gives you a little bit of a hedging.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

Two things in the U.S. market to be curious about. First of all, your expectation of share, it looks like
you've got some key new product launches. Interested in how you think about your major appliance
market share performance in '20. And then secondly, curious how you're seeing retailers managing their
business in what looks to be a sustained, somewhat slower growth environment and also an environment
where it appears Sears is probably giving up less share funding their growth.

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So Eric, it's Marc. I mean as you've seen in our outlook, so for North America, we have a lot of new
product innovations where we do believe we have some share growth opportunities. Certainly, on the 2
products which we've just shown, our top load and dishwasher, the old dishwasher platform or architecture
which we have was almost 10 years old. So I mean bringing in such an architecture with great features,
that should open opportunities for some share growth. And I'm not talking about promotional share
growth. I'm talking about structural share growth in a healthy business. So yes, we have certain ambition
for share growth in North America.

Related to your question about retailers, yes, it's obvious that the kind of windfall which came out of a
Sear's decline for many other retailers, that has diminished. I mean that's basically nonexisting. But right
now, I would say it's a reasonably stable retail environment. The home improvement -- having a strong
growth in home appliances, Best Buy being very well established, but also some other good regional
players. So I think it's -- right now we don't see a dramatic move across the retail landscape. We've seen
some ins and outs when it comes to inventory management of retailers. And I think you all have seen that
in the AHAM shipment data in October and then subsequent in December. So there's been some moves,
which, of course, impact us and our entire supply chain. But beyond this one, we don't see dramatic
moves across the different retailers.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc.

Kenneth Robinson Zener
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Jim, I just have a quick question. So look, the EPS mix, given your expansion in margins that you guys
are giving in guidance, should we basically expect kind of a normal EPS cadence, meaning front half, a
little under half the earnings, first quarter kind of that 21%, 22% range, just given the strength and the
different moving parts? I just want to make sure we're kind of thinking about if your business balance is
shifting this year.

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Ken, I think you should expect within this year a similar seasonality. And I mean, even in the first
quarter, we tend to be pretty close to 20% is what is we look at historically. But a similar 45-55 type of
split that you've seen in other years is a safe assumption.

Kenneth Robinson Zener
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then given the kind of -- in North America, and I understand you're moving to -- away from
the volume price/mix discussion given AHAM and a long history there. I understand. I'm wondering if
you might be able to anticipate, I mean, if the result -- if the revenue is down, I mean, how are you guys
going to go about kind of explaining this? Or what type of communication could we expect to hear from
you, absent that -- those data points just so none of us get caught by surprise, you, all or us, in terms of
if results are better or worse just so we can properly interpret it? I mean do you think you'll be able to talk
about volume even though you're not reporting it or the price/mix? How will that dialogue change?

James W. Peters
Executive VP & CFO

Well, Ken, I would expect, first thing, is there'll still be obviously industry data out there that will give an
indication of which direction the industry is going, and especially from a North America perspective now
that it's really 2 key markets and the biggest 1 being the U.S. Currency also doesn't play a big difference
within there. So as I said, I don't think that whether we disclose units or not within the North America
business will make a significant difference because of a couple of big variables that already drive it are out
there. Obviously, we will talk about how we believe we're doing from a share perspective and then what
the benefits of price and mix are. We'll continue to talk about that on a go-forward basis, which also is an
indicator of revenues versus what unit performance is doing.

Kenneth Robinson Zener
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then I guess this is -- just looking at AHAM, and it's kind of interesting, right? I mean you
had for the year, laundry was up 1 to 2 points, kitchen and fridge was down I think 3 to 4. How do you
think about -- or what does that say to you about kind of the market that we're seeing some of these
categories in a sustained growth challenging environment relative to, Marc, the fixed cost? Because this
global architecture that you mentioned in the laundry seems to be a really important factor for Whirlpool
given your global platform to kind of extract leverage from categories that really are challenged in terms
of growth.

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So Ken, I mean, on a go-forward basis, to be honest, we don't see dramatic differences across the
different product groups in terms of where we would see the industry growth or development. Given what
I said before, it's kind of -- there is at least the early indication that the housing may strengthen. The

housing strengthening, that typically translates in kitchen suites. So that should help the cooking, the
dishwasher, refrigeration business, but I would not get -- read too much into this one. So I wouldn't break
down the pieces too much. I would say, right now our guidance for next year industry is pretty much flat.
But very frankly, I think the uncertain factor to the upside could be the housing and how housing now
develops, if that's stabilized and if we see the growth trends extending beyond the December number. But
again, don't read too much into the different subcategories.

Kenneth Robinson Zener
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And I enjoyed your interview yesterday.

Marc Robert Bitzer
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. Appreciate it, Ken.

First of all, thank you for joining us all. And let me, given that we just came to the last question, let me
just quickly wrap up and summarize. First of all, I want to start out -- with all the numbers in and out, I
want to remind everybody, we had an all-time record year last year. We feel very good about it. And we
closed an all-time record year with the best quarter ever in our history, which I think is more remarkable
given that we did not have a lot of tailwinds throughout the year. Industry demand didn't help us. We still
saw cost inflation throughout most parts of the year. So we feel very good about what we've achieved last
year. But now we're in January 2020. The most important thing about last year is that it gave us a good
momentum as we exited the year. So we feel very good about momentum, which we'll carry into 2020,
and I hope you heard also that confidence throughout the earnings call.

As we look into 2020, and we laid that out, we have 3 operational priorities: We are very focused on
getting the cost out of the system. We are focused on executing the product launches, which we talked
about. And obviously, there's a lot more launches beyond those 2 ones, which we highlighted.

And from a regional perspective, of course, we have a key focus not only in maintaining strong margins in
North America, but particularly turning -- continue to turn around Europe and China. That is a key focus.
But then in a broader perspective, and this comes back to our Investor Day, I want to remind everybody,
our strategy has not changed. Beyond the operational priorities and delivering on our commitments, we
have a very strong focus on continuing to execute along our strategic imperatives, which is not only about
product leadership, but it's our entire digital transformation, be it on redefining what the product is, be
it on winning digital consumer journey. So there's a strong focus in our company around the strategic
transformation, and we feel very good about where we are. And we will kind of increase our efforts
throughout the year to kind of create a long-term, strong and sustainable business.

With that in mind, I just want to thank you for joining us today, and talk to you next quarter.
