AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 24, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Air Products & Chemicals First Quarter Earnings Release Call. Today's call
is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments
made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.

Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

Thank you, Leanne. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' First Quarter 2020 Earnings
Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined
today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.

After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this
call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements.
Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on
Slide #2. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we
specifically state otherwise, we are referring to adjusted non-GAAP measures, including adjusted earnings
per share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin on both a company-wide and segment basis,
and ROCE. Reconciliations can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.

Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule
to be on our call today. I would like to thank everybody at Air Products to again delivering a very strong
quarter. We are very pleased with our earnings per share of $2.14 for the first quarter, up 15% over last
year's strong results and the 23rd, I'd like to repeat that the 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year
earnings growth.

Please now turn to Slide #3. Safety is always the most important focus for all of us at Air Products, and
our goal continues to be 0 accidents and incidents. I was pleased to see improvement this quarter as our
people redoubled their efforts so that we can move towards our ultimate goal of an accident-free work
environment.

Slide #4 shows our goal and Slide #5 shows our management philosophy. I have discussed this with you
many times before, so I don't want to take your time to repeat it, but those slides are very important
guiding principles that we follow.

Now please turn to Slide #6, our Five-Point Plan that we have discussed with you in detail before. But
I do not want to focus on our past performance because, frankly, I like the dreams of the future more
than the history of the past. Our dream of the future is to make sure Air Products will continue to be the
safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world providing excellent service
to our customers. Our dream of the future is for Air Products to become the largest American chemical
company as measured by market capitalization. We will achieve this by focusing on growth, driven by our
core competencies.

Our dream of the future is for Air Products to be the leader in providing solutions to the world's
environmental sustainability challenges through gasification of coal, pet coke and refinery residues,
developing solutions to capture CO2 from gasifiers and hydrogen plants and further developing
technologies and making Air Products the leader in providing hydrogen for transportation around the

world. Our dream of the future is to be a company that has a higher purpose beyond just creating value
for our shareholders through improved financial performance. We want to be a company that people from
all walks of life and nationalities come together, work together and feel that they belong and that their
contribution matters and are appreciated; a company that is focused on innovation to solve the substantial
environmental issues facing our humanity; a company that is passionate and contributes to the well-being
of all the communities in which we operate around the world; a global company that brings people from
all over the world together to collaborate, improve understanding and prevent conflicts that arise from
misunderstanding. We are committed to work very hard to realize our dreams of the future by executing
on our Five-Point Plan strategy.

Now please turn to Slide #7. You can see our exciting gasification strategy. We continue to be very
focused on successfully executing this strategy and the announced projects, and we are making excellent
progress, and we continue to be very optimistic about this sector.

Slide #8 summarizes the Gulf Coast Ammonia project we announced earlier in January. As I said, this is
the largest U.S. investment in the history of Air Products and winning this project is a direct result of the
value of our Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline, the competitiveness of our hydrogen plants and our expertise
to develop, build and operate the largest projects in the history of industrial gas industry. As a result, this
project will exceed our commitments in terms of financial returns.

Please now turn to Slide #9. We have talked extensively about the significant opportunities for capital
investment to generate significant shareholder value. At the same time, the cash generation strength of
our existing business allows us to be confident in raising our dividend for the 38th consecutive year. The
more than 15% increase we announced yesterday to $1.34 per share per quarter is the largest per share
dividend increase in our history and will result in almost $1.2 billion directly returned to our shareholders
in form of dividend next year.

Now please turn to my favorite slide, Slide #10. You can see that our EBITDA margin continues to be more
than 40%, which is up over 1,500 basis points from early 2014.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, to give you the details of our very good financial performance. Scott?

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you very much, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 11 for our first quarter results. Our team delivered
another strong start to the year. Volume and price together increased 9% and were up in all 3 regions.
We delivered double-digit profit growth despite the soft economic activity around the world. Sales grew
modestly to $2.3 billion as strong underlying sales were offset by 5% lower energy pass-through and 2%
due to the India contract modification. The India contract was modified in December 2018. So this is the
last quarter we will see a year-on-year impact. Weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Chinese RMB and
euro lowered sales by another 1%. Volume growth of 6% was primarily driven by modest base business
growth, new plants, acquisitions and a short-term contract in Asia. Price was up 3%, the 10th consecutive
quarter of year-over-year price increase. EBITDA topped $900 million, up 14%, and EPS of $2.14 was up
15%. EBITDA margin was over 40%, the third consecutive quarter exceeding the 40% mark, up 460 basis
points, primarily driven by the higher price and the strong volumes.

Lower energy pass-through and the India contract modification contributed about half of the margin
increase. Sequentially, profits are down, primarily on seasonality in the regions and incentive
compensation adjustments, primarily in our corporate segment. ROCE continues to improve, up 100 basis
points over last year. We are pleased with the almost 300 basis point improvement since 2015, and we
anticipate further improvement as we increase earnings and deploy more of the cash on our balance
sheet.

Now please turn to Slide 12. Our fourth quarter EPS of $2.14 was up $0.28 per share or 15%, driven by
strong operating performance. Volume and price together contributed $0.40. Cost was unfavorable $0.12
as we continued to invest in business development and R&D resources to support our growth strategy.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 24, 2020

Equity affiliate income was favorable $0.02, while noncontrolling interest was unfavorable $0.02. The
nonoperating factors in total have no net impact this quarter.

Our effective tax rate of 19.8% was up 80 basis points from last year. We continue to expect an effective
tax rate of 20% to 21% in fiscal year 2020.

Interest expense was $0.07 lower this quarter as we paid off a bond last quarter and adopted new
accounting guidance that moves about $9 million per quarter from interest expense to nonoperating
expense.

Now please turn to Slide 13. We continue to generate strong cash flow. For the last 12 months, we
generated over $2.7 billion or $12.30 per share of distributable cash flow. From this distributable cash
flow, we paid almost 40% or $1 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.7 billion
available for high return industrial gas investments. As Seifi mentioned, this strong cash flow enables us to
continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.

Slide #14 provides an update on our capital deployment progress. As you can see, we now show over
$18 billion of investment capacity available over the 5-year period from FY 2018 through FY 2022. As
expected, our total capacity continues to grow as we increase EBITDA. The over $18 billion includes
almost $10 billion of additional debt capacity available today, almost $5 billion of investable cash flow
between now and the end of FY '22 and over $3 billion already spent.

We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating.
Today, we have a total of about $8 billion of project and M&A commitments with about $7 billion remaining
to spend on them. So you can see, we have already spent 20% and already committed well over half of
our total available capacity.

Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Scott. I'm very pleased to say that we generated excellent results in all of our operating
geographies. All 3 regions reported double-digit profit growth and significant margin expansion. We are
not depending on economic growth around the world, but are meeting our commitments to you through
our own actions by realizing value we provide to our customers and by successfully executing high-return
growth projects.

Now please turn to Slide #15, where you can see that our team in Asia has again delivered another set of
outstanding results. As we have previously mentioned, trade tensions have not significantly impacted our
business. Our customers and the Chinese government continues to support Air Products' projects, and we
remain very optimistic about our long-term prospects in this important region of the world.

For the quarter, sales increased 11% from last year, with volume and price together up 13%. Volumes
increased 9%, driven by new projects, base business growth and a short-term supply contract. As a
reminder, the year-on-year impact of Lu'An has lapsed since the project has been successfully operating
for more than a year. Overall pricing for the region increased 4%, and actually, our merchant pricing
increased by 10%, the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Price was positive
in all key countries. Profits and margins were higher, driven by the strong volume and price. EBITDA
increased 16%, and EBITDA margin expanded 260 points to just over 50%.

Sequentially, sales and profit softened as the impact of lower volumes, including less benefit from the
short-term supply contracts, was partially offset by productivity. As you would expect, we do anticipate a
seasonal slowdown during the Lunar New Year Holiday in quarter 2.

Now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to discuss our Americas results. Scott?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 24, 2020

Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our Americas results. America's strong pricing
trend continued, up 3%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-on-year improvement. Price was
better across all major product lines and in all subregions. Volume was up 1%, driven by stronger Gulf
Coast hydrogen volumes with less planned customer maintenance outages than last year. This was
partially offset by persistent economic weakness in South America. Lower energy pass-through reduced
sales by 8%. EBITDA of $410 million, increased 11%, supported by better price, higher volume and lower
maintenance costs. EBITDA margin of almost 44% was up almost 700 basis points, primarily due to better
price, lower maintenance and improved productivity. Energy pass-through also contributed about 300
basis points.

Looking into next quarter, we anticipate higher and above-average maintenance spending due to planned
life extension work on several facilities. We expect our full year maintenance expense to be within our
normal range.

Now I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?

Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa results. Our
EMEA business continued to generate strong price, volume and profit growth despite the challenging
economic conditions in the region. Volume was up 6%, primarily driven by increased hydrogen volumes in
our Rotterdam pipeline system and the CO2 business we acquired last year while base merchant business
volume remained stable. Price increased 3% with improvement across all major products and subregions.
This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement.

Sales were negatively impacted by 8% from the India contract change, 4% from lower energy pass-
through and 2% from unfavorable currency. As Scott mentioned, the India contract was modified in
December 2018. So this is the last quarter we will see a year-on-year impact. EBITDA of $188 million was
up 14%, supported by the strong price and volume. And EBITDA margin of nearly 38% improved over 600
basis points. The India contract change and lower energy pass-through contributed about 400 basis points
of this improvement.

Now please turn to Slide 18, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses
as well as central industrial gas costs. Other project activities offset the expected lower results from the
successful Jazan ASU sale of equipment project. However, we don't expect these other project activities to
continue at this level.

Please turn to Slide 19. Corporate segment, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our
corporate costs. Sales were higher this quarter, supported by contributions from the Golden Pass LNG
project. Profits were flat as the improved contribution from LNG was offset by higher corporate costs as
we continue to build our capabilities and strengthen our organization to successfully pursue our significant
growth opportunities. Sequentially, results were down as LNG had a lower quarter on normal sale of
equipment profit timing, and we saw relatively higher costs, including incentive compensation. We remain
very optimistic about additional LNG orders since our technology has been selected for several major
projects around the world that are awaiting final investment decisions or final agreements with our
customers.

Now I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, again, Simon. Now please turn to Slide #20. As you all know, and it's pretty obvious, we
continue to live in an uncertain world that we at Air Products cannot control. But we do have control over
the actions Air Products can take to succeed in a dynamic and changing world. We have a strong, capable
and flexible organization that remains focused on productivity and creating our own growth opportunities,
which will allow us to continue to deliver on our promise to investors. Despite this uncertainty, there is no
change in our fiscal year 2020 EPS guidance of $9.35 to $9.60, which is up 14% to 17% over our strong

fiscal year 2019 performance. As we continue to expect our fiscal -- we continue to expect our fiscal year
2020 CapEx to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. For second quarter of fiscal year 2020, our
earnings per share guidance is $2.10 to $2.20, which at midpoint is up 12% versus last year.

Now please turn to Slide #21. At midpoint, our fiscal year 2020 guidance represents 6 consecutive years
of double-digit earnings growth and 14% average earnings per share growth over this time. Thanks to the
great team at Air Products, we continue to deliver on our commitments.

Our team around the world continues to be very optimistic about the future of Air Products. Our Five-
Point strategic plan will differentiate us and drive our success going forward. Our safety, productivity and
operating performance provide the foundation for our continued growth. We have the financial capacity,
the technical position and the talent to take a full advantage of our exciting opportunities, and I'd like to
stress that we see -- we do see a lot of exciting opportunities ahead of us.

And finally, please turn to Slide #22. As always, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and
motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate our
strong performance. I want to thank all of our 17,000 people around the world for their commitment and
hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together. I
certainly am proud to be part of this winning team.
With that, now we are delighted to answer any questions that you might have.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Can you describe your volume growth in oxygen and nitrogen in the United States in the merchant area?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

We would prefer not to get into that detail, Jeff. Because that is obviously a very significant competitive
information, and we usually do not disclose that. I'm sorry about that. But hope you bear with us that we
want to stick with that policy.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. You're going to spend $4 billion to $4.5 billion in CapEx this year. Does that amount of spending lead
to some costs coming into the income statement in advance of the capital projects coming on stream? In
other words, are your current returns being penalized at all by the large capital expenditure budget that
you have for this year?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Jeff, you make a very good point. As you notice from our results, our cost, I mean, if you focus on the
cost, you see increasing cost. That's not because we have become less efficient. That is because we are
building the organization in anticipation of executing these projects. So you are very correct that we will
see, as you are seeing, some increase in cost. It is not that significant, but it is there, and you're very --
it's very appropriate for you to point that out.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I have a follow-up on the $0.12 of cost increase in the quarter. The investments you're making to grow
the business. Jeff, obviously, just talked about the existing plan. How much of the spend is going towards
future opportunities like hydrogen mobility or other things because I was just curious on the R&D side of
the equation, what it is that you're driving at?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the expenditures are in 2 aspects. One is, obviously, R&D expenditure, which is you kind of know
about how much we are spending, it is not that huge. But the other thing is actually hiring very high
quality, experienced people to oversee the execution of these projects that we expect to get. We don't
want to get the projects and then look for talent. We are putting the talent in place in anticipation of those
projects, which we are sure will happen. So a significant part of the cost is the hiring and onboarding of
all of these people, and there is a substantial number of people that we have brought in, especially to
strengthen our technology section and our project execution capability.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 24, 2020

Okay. That makes sense. If I could just ask a follow-up on the dividend. Obviously, a very large increase,
a record increase. Last year, when we talked about it, you mentioned that you historically has spoken to
your investors about a 2.5% to 3% yield. Obviously, this takes you to about 2.25%. My assumption is
that with the increase in the share price last year to go back to 2.5% to 3% would have been perhaps
unattractive in terms of moving cash flow away from investment projects. But I guess the question is, how
should we think about sort of the dividend growth algorithm going forward? Should we be thinking more
about keeping the yield at 2.25% to 2.5%? Or what philosophy can you help us with this year?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

That's an excellent question. We obviously take a lot of different factors into consideration when we decide
on the dividend. It's not just 2.5% of the stock price, but it's also our cash flow. I think you should expect
that we would continue to give approximately half of our free cash flow as dividends. That has been kind
of one guidance, and obviously, a percentage of the share price is another part. I personally think that we
should continue to pay a very healthy dividend, something which is in the order of 2.5% of our share price
and also about half of our free cash. So this year, I mean, we are increasing it 15%. It would have been
ridiculous if we had to start right now and we can't anticipate what the share price will be. So we make
the decision based on a lot of different factors that's in, but overall guidance, about half of our free cash or
about 2.5% of the share price.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Seifi, if I back out the effect of the India contract modification, it looks like your volume grew about 6%
year-over-year. And so I have a 2-part question. First, I was wondering if you could comment as to the
effect of new projects in that number versus baseline volume growth. And then secondly, since you're one
of the first chemical companies to report this season, just wondering if you could comment on which end-
use markets might have trended better than expected? And if there are any that came in lower than your
expectation?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you, Kevin. Excellent question. In terms of breaking down between organic growth and new
projects, our basic approach has been not to disclose that detail. But I would like to specifically answer
your second question. We obviously beat the forecast. The reason for that is that the economic growth in
Asia was better than we expected. The economic growth in Europe didn't become as bad as we expected
because of Brexit. And in the U.S., there was not much of a change, and Latin America continues to be
a disaster. So overall, as we go forward, we are now a little bit more optimistic about Asia. Obviously, in
the second quarter, you have the Lunar New Year and that dampens the growth, but we expect that to
continue as we go forward in the other quarters. And I'm hoping that things will kind of stabilize in Europe
and in the U.S. But that's kind of how we see the thing.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Crédit Suisse.

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Can you just give us a real quick update on your various Saudi projects, primarily Jazan, the MOUs and
just the future potential for a pipeline build-out? Just any additional framework on Saudi Arabia will be
appreciated.

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 24, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

Chris, obviously, we are very honored and very proud to be given the gigantic project of the integrated
gas project in Jazan. That is not only an equivalent of a $12 billion acquisition, but it also is a phenomenal
reference in terms of our gasification capability. It is using the Shell technology and it is a gigantic project.
So we are very happy with that. We are making a lot of progress on that. And I continue to be very
optimistic that we will try -- that we will be kind of complete the financing in this quarter. But you do need
to appreciate, and I'm sure you do, that we are going to go to the market for $7 billion of debt considering
the different events in the world and all of that, things might not happen exactly on the date. But the fact
of the matter is that we are talking about a 25-year project. So the impact on Air Product for the long-
term is extremely positive. Now whether we actually close in the month of March or whether it is in the
month of April, we'll see. But we continue to be very optimistic about that project. As I said, we are very
proud of that. And quite frankly, you see that we have not changed our forecast. That means that we still
believe that this will happen at the time that we thought at the beginning of the year. Is that okay, Chris?

Christopher S. Parkinson
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's very helpful. Just as a quick follow-up and a little bit longer-term one. Just carbon capture was
just indistinctly a clear theme at Davos this year and was basically discussed across by pretty much
every global leader, the IEA and plethora of oil companies, all of them with their own partner proprietary
technology. Can you just update us on your own thoughts on this front? Whether your technologies fit
into the broader equation? And how the investment community should at least begin to think about this
opportunity as it pertains to Air Products?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Chris, we have recognized and made carbon capture a priority for the company 5 years ago. That is the
future. That is a necessity in order to deal with the global warming. And I am very happy to see that
responsible people are now actually talking about it. Hopefully, we were ahead of the game. We have been
working on different technologies on this. The first thing is that we do have the technology to capture
carbon from hydrogen plants and I think gasifiers and so on for enhanced oil recovery. We do have a
commercial scale plant operating in Port Arthur. It's one of the biggest in the world, and we capture the
CO2 and put it in the pipeline there for enhanced oil recovery. That kind of projects you should expect that
we will do on a very large-scale around the world. The second thing is sequestration. We have developed
technologies on that and we are working on that. And hopefully, in time, we will be able to announce the
kind of commercial projects that we are doing. The third and most exciting thing is some new technologies
that we are developing. And in respect to carbon capture in a different way, I don't want to go through
the details of that because I don't think it's appropriate at this stage. We are laser-focused on carbon
capture. If you look at our annual report, and we make it very clear, we say gasification today, carbon
capture tomorrow and hydrogen for mobility the day after tomorrow. So those are the priorities of our
company, and we are obviously trying to be the leader on that, the same way that we became the leader
in gasification.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.

With regard to coal gasification in China, can you give us an update on the market there and what you're
seeing in terms of interest and demand? I know certainly over the last year or so, there was a lot of
demand and a lot of talk about it. We haven't necessarily seen a lot of new announcements. So I guess,
can you give us an update on your confidence in that area?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 24, 2020

We continue to be optimistic about that. We did announce the coal gasification project, as I'm sure
you saw, and we expect to announce some more in the years to come. We are working on Juitai. We
announced Debang and there are other projects. We don't see any slowdown on that, and we are very
optimistic about that, John.

John Patrick McNulty

Great. And then just a question on the helium markets. Can you speak to kind of what you're seeing in the
industry right now and how you're seeing how that plays out through 2020?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, John, I think it is not a secret that supply-demand situation in helium is challenging. Basically, there
is not enough supply to meet the demand. And obviously, that has had an effect on the commercial value
of helium. And you can -- and you are seeing that in our results. In terms of 2020, I think that situation
will continue, and it is quite possible that, that situation will continue for a few years to come. I don't want
to anticipate that because it depends on the performance of the current sources or bringing on a stream
of some other sources. But helium has such a small number of sources and so on. So it's very transparent
about what's going on. There are not that many places that produce helium. So it's very easy for investors
and people like yourself to figure out what's going on.

And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Can you give any new update on the Yankuang project. It's a large one, and it's still, I guess, progressing
little bit slowly here?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, there is no additional update. I've always mentioned that, that project is a big project. We signed the
Memorandum of Understanding in November of 2017 when the President was visiting China. That project
is moving very slowly. Some of it is our fault. I have explained that, that we want to make sure that there
is coal allocation before we go and invest $1.5 billion of our money there. So I think you should expect a
slow progress on that project.

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Got it. And do you have the merchant price increases for both the Americas and EMEA, you gave us the
Asia price increase?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Merchant price increases are the way we see it. Americas is about 7%, Europe is about 5%, and Asia is
10%. We usually don't disclose that detail, but since you asked the question, David, I had to answer you.

Your EBITDA margins were 40%, which is great. If you take out the energy pass-through, EBITDA margins
were closer to 37% to 38% and then there was also positive impact of India contract modification. So it
seems like your sort of same-store EBITDA margins are in that mid-30s to maybe high 30s range. Is that
a good range going forward? And how will the new coal gasification projects and your build-own operate
model sort of impact those margins in the future?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Order of magnitude, your math is correct, and we expect the margins to continue to be in the range that
you mentioned. But as we do these bigger projects that will improve. That has -- that will have a positive
effect on those margins. Sorry, I'm losing my voice a little bit. But -- so overall, you should expect that our
margins will stay at around 38%, 37% to 40%, 49% -- I mean 39%, 40%, around that range.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Okay. While you take a breath, let me ask a question to Scott. Working capital was a drag. And I'm sure
that was partly driven by new project startups, but your receivables were down, payables were up. Can
you sort of shed more light on working capital drag? And how much of that impact is from new startups?

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, P.J. Our DSO was about 52 days. So we're in good shape, and we
constantly monitor that. What you're seeing this quarter is really driven by the timing between our
SOE opportunities and some of the timing difference between when we're booking earnings versus
the collection of cash. So nothing systemic, and we'll see that bounce around. So -- but thanks for the
question.

Operator

And our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

I wanted to ask about the Asia business, and you've referenced the short term contract, which I believe
also contributed last quarter. But can you just provide some additional detail on how much of that was
contributing to revenues in the quarter? And how we should think about that contribution for the rest of
fiscal '20?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

It is a small contribution that we actually had, but it's not material and it's not going to change things that
much.

Michael Joseph Harrison
Seaport Global Securities LLC, Research Division

All right. And the other question I had is on hydrogen. I believe you mentioned -- you called out strength
in the Gulf Coast as well as in Europe. Just wondering if you can provide any sense of what's driving that?
And then it sounds like -- just looking for clarification, it sounds like the turnaround activity was maybe a
little bit lower than you expected, but maybe maintenance cost go up in Q2 and net-net about normal in
terms of overall maintenance activity for the full year. Is that -- do I understand that correctly?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 24, 2020

Yes. Number one, I think, as Scott mentioned in his comments that we expect a higher maintenance cost
in the second quarter because of the timing. But for the year, we expect our maintenance cost to be what
number that we have discussed with you before, which is order of magnitude $250 million, $260 million
a year. With respect to hydrogen demand, it is not huge, but we do see some effect because of the IMO
2020 that people need more hydrogen in order to clean up the fuel.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.

Duffy Fischer

First question is just around the capital. It looks like you're going to increase your capital spend about
300% per quarter, if you kind of rough the Q4 -- the Q1 number to get to your annual number. What does
that end up doing to your tax rate as you shift your geographic footprint over time?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

I'd like Scott to answer that, but while he is kind of pulling his stats together. And obviously, you know
that the reason for that is because we expect a big chunk of capital expenditure because of Jazan when
we close. So that is one of the reasons that the number kind of looks, hey, this quarter, it was this, and
suddenly, it's going to go up. That is because of Jazan. In terms of the effect, in terms of our tax, I don't
think it is material, but I'd like Scott to comment on that.

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, sure. Thanks, Duffy. So as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, for the year we expect it still
to be in the 20% to 21% book effective tax rate. And obviously, that will move around quarter-to-quarter,
be dependent on where -- how much money we make and where we make it. But even going forward on
the other side of the Jazan, I would still put it in that sort of range. I will also mention, though, so that's
a book tax rate. From a cash tax perspective, we've historically seen in the kind of the mid-teens. And
similarly, it depends on where and how much we make. But I would expect it to maybe be the mid-to-
upper teens on a cash tax basis, okay?

Duffy Fischer

Great. And then in what was resoundingly a good quarter, the most eye-popping number to me was the
10% pricing in the merchant business in Asia. Can you just talk about the supply-demand dynamics? How
strong that market feels? And how resilient that kind of pricing momentum feels going forward?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

We feel optimistic about that. You obviously appreciate the nature of the industry, and we don't want
to comment on pricing. So I don't want to say too much, but we continue to think that there is a good
supply-demand situation that, that kind of pricing will continue.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

James Michael Sheehan
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

On your return on capital employed number, a little over 13% and expanding, where do you think that
number can get to after some of the very large projects start-up over the next few years?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 24, 2020

Jim, that's a good question. We have always said that our target is 15%. So we would like to get it to 15%
and I think in time, we will get there. Actually, as we spend more cash, that number will go up because
the way we calculate the return, it includes the cash. So if tomorrow, we spend all the cash on projects
that number will enhance. Other people don't include the cash because -- so as a result of that, I mean,
you understand the dynamics of the top of the line and the bottom of the line. But fundamentally, we are
looking forward to increasing that number to 15%. And Scott has a comment that he wants to add.

Michael Scott Crocco
Executive VP & CFO

I just want to build on it and already, if you take a look at our cash on hand, if you were to look at it on a
net debt basis, net of the cash, it's already almost 16% roughly.

James Michael Sheehan
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Terrific. And on your pricing trends, you've been very disciplined about raising prices, and it looks like the
supply-demand balance is supporting that. Just curious if you're starting to see any signs of market share
loss as a result of your pricing execution?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

I don't want to claim that we have not had any market share loss, but it has not been significant or
material, but we might have some. When -- we were very open about this thing in February of last year
when we said that we are -- we need to recover some of our cost as we said before we expect and we are
going to -- willing to live with market share loss, but we have not seen a significant one, but there might
be some here and there. I don't want to claim we haven't lost anything. But it isn't anything that would
force us to change our strategy.

Operator

And our next question will come from John Roberts with UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Is the sequential pricing just rounding down to 0 or is it close to 0.5% or so, so that the year-over-year
pricing for the overall company will stay up near 3% over the next few quarters?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

John, you really do your homework, John. I'm very impressed that you are providing that detail, a lot of
credit to you. It is rounding down. It is actually up sequential...

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And then if you built a bridge between the December quarter earnings and the March quarter earnings
here, you mentioned that the Lunar New Year will be a sequential headwind. Could you talk about
sequentially, from an earnings perspective, any other puts and takes as we go from December quarter to
March quarter?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the thing is that when we give you the guidance, obviously, we needed to look at everything. And
we debated this thing quite a bit yesterday, quite honestly. And that is the dynamic of the Lunar New Year,
which we always -- we don't know exactly how it will work out. And then there is obviously the headline in
the papers that you see about this virus thing. So how would that develop and how the effect of that. That

is why we decided to take the 2 into consideration and expand the range. We usually give you guidance
within $0.05. This time we are giving you guidance within $0.10. So that is our thinking right now, that's
our best judgment.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.

Jonas I. Oxgaard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I was hoping to get some help tying some numbers, is a 2-parter if you don't mind. But the first one is,
you announced the $500 million project a few weeks ago and I see in your CapEx, you raised it by $500
million, but you had some other announcements in the quarter as well, like the South Korea project. So
where did the CapEx from South Korea and others go? Did some projects fall out?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

No. I don't think anything has fall out. Simon does these numbers in detail. So Simon, would you like to
comment, please?

Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

Sure. Jonas, sorry if we miscommunicated. I think our CapEx guidance, our expected spending for the
year has not changed, quite frankly. You could also expect that when we give you CapEx guidance, it may
include projects that haven't yet been announced but we're highly confident about. I would also just add
the Gulf Coast Ammonia we just announced that there wouldn't be a huge amount of spending in this
fiscal year anyway.

Jonas I. Oxgaard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Also, I meant that long-term committed to the spend the -- what is it $10.3 billion?

Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

Sure. So obviously, we continue to spend money on projects that continue to come on stream and so that
numbers come up a little bit.

Jonas I. Oxgaard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Yes. But the question is, the number came up $500 million, which is exactly the project you announced
in the Gulf Coast, right? Yet there were other announcements in that same quarter that apparently didn't
make it into the sum total.

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

It's because some of the projects have come on stream, and when they come on stream, they are taken
off of the -- off of what we say as backlog.

Simon R. Moore
Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations & Sustainability

And Jonas, I guess, I would just point to the fact that when we give you a backlog number, it may include
at times projects that we haven't announced yet if we're highly certain of them.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. The other thing I was trying to tie was the guidance for the year didn't change
even though you beat pretty handily. Is the inference the slipping of Jazan? Or how should I think about
that?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, it's becoming -- we need to put everything together. But obviously, this quarter, our results are
better than expectation. We had told you $2.05 to $2.10 and we delivered $2.14. So as a result, we felt
better about our base business, and therefore, but there are -- the timing of the Jazan thing. So at the
end of the day, we made the judgment that overall we should be able to meet our commitment.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Nice quarter. You noted that Lu'An has anniversaried -- I think it's your first sort of major gasification
project. Can you maybe talk about what you've learned from running it for a year? Any positive surprises,
negative surprises? Obviously, it's done well. Just kind of wanted your thoughts on how that has done over
the last year?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

Thank you for asking that question because I wanted to brag about it a little bit, quite honestly. We have
had a very positive experience. Number one, our expectation of the amount of time that we can keep the
project online when we started and people will tell you gasifiers or something like 85%, 86%, we have had
those gasifiers online for more than 95% of the time. So that is very good news. The second thing is that
in terms of financial performance is exactly as we thought. And the third thing is that we have learned a
lot by operating these shared gasifiers first hand. And we are seeing some positive impacts that we will
incorporate in the future projects. And I'm also very proud of our people that we gave them this and we
had to put in something like 500 new people on this thing. We have operated this thing, knocking on board
very safely and very efficiently. So it has been a very positive experience, and it significantly has increased
our confidence in taking on new projects.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just one quick one on the range for the year. Just curious, at the high end, what do you
think needs to happen to sort of be close to that end versus sort of the midpoint or the lower end?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

We need to get lucky with the economy and close Jazan in time, so...

And we'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.

Yes, Seifi, if a partner were to come to you and offer you either an excess supply of energy or maybe a
renewable energy supply, do you have the capability of producing hydrogen from electrolysis?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 24, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, we do. And we already do that. We have the capability and we are pursuing projects in that -- of that
nature.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And when you look out longer-term, Seifi, in your -- in this pursuit of hydrogen for transportation, how
would you rank that technology versus the standard of methane reforming versus this more recent project
with using ammonia as a carrier of hydrogen?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

I think that the world is moving toward green hydrogen. And green hydrogen is obviously using solar and
then electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen. We think that is the future and a significant number of
projects will be done in that way. And that is where we are building our capability. You are very right, that
is the future. We definitely think that is the future. Yes, ammonia thing is obviously a special issue, which
is transportation of hydrogen. But you should think that people would use solar in order to make green
hydrogen and then take that green hydrogen convert it to ammonia and then send it to Japan.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And with respect to carbon sequestration, is that Gulf Coast Ammonia project of yours have any
requirements on you to sequester the CO2?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

No, not the Gulf Coast. We got the permit -- we are not recovering CO2 at that plant at this time.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes, I was really referring to the long-term contracts for this ammonia. Is there any component of that,
that is expecting that the carbon to be sequestered?

Seifollah Ghasemi
Chairman, President & CEO

No, there is no such requirement.

And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.

Laurence Alexander
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Two quick ones. Can you help us with the effective tailwind for next year from the projects that are lapping
next year and then the new projects coming on, just so we can get a sense for how much of a deceleration
compared to this year is implied by the backlog? And secondly, on carbon sequestration, I think a lot of
the environmental debate focuses on the relative cost versus mitigation coming out at about 5 to 10x the
cost of mitigating through, for example, tree planting. But obviously, carbon sequestration has the virtue
that is a project you control. Can you give us a sense for how you're thinking about sequestration versus
mitigation? And how quickly you can bring down the cost of the sequestration technology?

AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 24, 2020

I think all of these questions that you're asking in terms of the carbon capture and so on depends on
the location that we are -- you are and which part of the world you are and what are the incentives and
all of that. So it will be difficult to give you a general answer. With respect to your first question, with
respect to -- I do not see any drag on our results next year as a result of the project. So I'm not sure I
fully understood your question. We expect that for 2021, our EPS will grow another 10% versus 2020. We
don't expect any deceleration.

With that, I think that was the last question that people have signed up for. So I would like to thank
everybody for being on our call. Thanks for taking time from your very busy schedule to listen to our
presentation. We appreciate your interest, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again
next quarter. In the meantime, have a great day, and have a nice quarter and expect some good results
from Air Products, when we announce our results next quarter. Thanks, again. Have a nice day.
