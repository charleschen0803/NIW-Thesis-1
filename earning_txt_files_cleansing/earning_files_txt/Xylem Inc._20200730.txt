Now please turn to Slide 4, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let me start by expressing my sincere
hope that you and everyone close to you are keeping safe and well. As you've seen from our release this
morning and consistent with our pre-announcement 2 weeks ago, our second quarter performance was
better than we had expected.

In hindsight, April turned out to be the low point of the quarter. We hope we'll eventually look back and
say it was a low point of the pandemic. After April, we saw modest improvement in both May and June
as demand began to stabilize in our key markets. Because our business is global, we were exposed to
the pandemic's effects early, and so we've also benefited from our presence in markets that have already
begun to recover. Back in April, it's fair to say that uncertainty overshadowed both supply and demand
outlooks as COVID spread from Asia to Europe and then North America. So we felt it responsible to set
our second quarter guidance range intentionally wide to bracket a broad set of scenarios for the macro
environment.

Today, we have far more insight and confidence on the supply side, that's because of one notably positive
effect of feeling COVID's impact early. It catalyzed early action by our teams. Fortunately, we were
working from solid financial foundations and a strong position. So we were able to focus on adapting to
the uncertainty and managing the things under our control. In addition to addressing the immediate need,

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

those actions have built a more robust foundation for both the medium and long term. I want to make
a point of giving credit to my colleagues across Xylem and all of our external partners who made that
happen. They've shown incredible resolve and resilience to a time that has put excessive demands on
everyone.

I want to credit everyone around the world who's kept the water flowing and kept essential services
running despite everything being thrown at them. Throughout this period of incredible challenge, they've
focused on keeping everyone safe and serving our communities. Within Xylem, I want to highlight the
work of our supply chain, manufacturing and our distribution team. They've kept our customers supplied
and serviced with very few interruptions.

Today, we are up and running across our manufacturing network at greater than 90% availability. So while
demand-side uncertainties continue, our outlook now reflects greater clarity and confidence about supply,
putting us in a much better position to guide for the third quarter.

I also want to recognize the dedication of our commercial teams, despite the challenges of working
remotely. They drove 10% backlog growth, despite COVID-related macro softness. You will have seen our
announced wins in Telangana, India and with Anglian Water in the U.K. The Telangana irrigation project
is our largest win in the country to date, and we do anticipate it will generate roughly $115 million in
revenue over the next 2 to 3 years. And our smart networking deployment with Anglian in the U.K. which
combines metrology, communications and digital offerings, is expected to deliver revenues of roughly $90
million over the course of the project. These wins are further evidence of the durability of our business,
even in challenging times.

Because of the differentiation of our portfolio and the resilience of our teams, we expect we will have
more news to share about additional big wins when we deliver our third quarter results. Clearly, I'm very
pleased that the team's hard work is evidenced both operationally and commercially. Having said that, the
outlook for the second half is still not back normal. Therefore, we are not reinstating full year guidance.
Conditions are improving in a number of our key markets, but the shape of the COVID curve overall is still
unpredictable.

Now I'd like to hand over to Mark to provide some detail in the second quarter, and then we'll come back
to our outlook and the trends we see emerging through this period. Mark, over to you.

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. Our revenue in the quarter declined 12%, which was better than
we anticipated coming out of the first quarter. As Patrick mentioned, our revenue and orders performance
improved throughout the quarter with a very strong month in June. Geographically, U.S. revenues declined
15% as our businesses felt the impact of site shutdowns and project deployment delays. Emerging
markets were down 15%, driven largely by the lockdowns in the Middle East and India. Notably, China
grew 6% in the quarter as the utility end market returned to nearly pre-pandemic levels, and industrial
and commercial businesses began to modestly recover.

Europe was also a relative bright spot for us as revenues declined a modest 3%. Western Europe, which is
the majority of our European revenue base was down mid-single digits. However, our business in Eastern
Europe grew double digits. This has been a region we've been very focused on, and I want to highlight the
tremendous work our team has done there. They have quietly but consistently delivered a revenue CAGR
of mid-teens growth over the last 5 years.

Orders declined 9% in the quarter, while total backlog grew 10%, driven by the large Signature deals
Patrick mentioned earlier. Backlog shippable in 2020 is down 1%. However, backlog shippable after 2020 is
up 23%, which gives us confidence that we'll be emerging from 2020 in a position of strength with a solid
foundation for growth in 2021 and beyond.

Operating margin was 9.3% in the quarter, which I'll review in more detail by segment shortly. Based
on our experience in China, we entered the second quarter cautious of COVID potential impacts on our
supply chain. However, based on those learnings and the great work of our global supply chain teams,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

5

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

we successfully managed through the COVID challenges and turned those learnings into a competitive
advantage. Our teams quickly adapted and began to work in new ways with our customers, our suppliers
and internally, enabling us to deliver earnings per share of $0.40, an achievement punctuated by
commercial savvy, operational excellence, cost discipline and a focus on what really matters.

Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review second quarter results by segment. Water Infrastructure orders
grew 7%, and total backlog grew 24% in the quarter. This performance was largely driven by the $115
million deal we won in India, which is expected to deliver revenue beginning late this year and over the
next 3 years. Shippable backlog for the remainder of 2020 is up 5%. Segment revenue declined 8% in the
quarter and was significantly impacted by declines in the dewatering, industrial and construction rental
business.

As we noted last quarter, we expect utilities to continue to remain resilient as they focus on maintaining
their critical infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment. This was certainly true this past
quarter as our wastewater transport business declined only 4%. To date, we've seen wastewater capital
projects continue with minimal delays. This was an important driver of the strong quarter from our
treatment business, which grew 7%.

While U.S. sales were impacted by double-digit declines in the dewatering business, Western Europe
revenues were flat in the quarter, showing resilience and some early signs of recovery, especially with our
utility customers.

As we continue to feel the near-term impacts from COVID-19 across the emerging markets, we remain
confident in the long-term growth prospects for the water sector. The Chinese and Indian governments, for
example, have expressed their ongoing commitment to continued investments in infrastructure for clean
drinking water, wastewater treatment and environmental protection.

Operating margin in the quarter was 16.2%, contracting on lower volumes and unfavorable mix impacts
from dewatering, partially offset by productivity, cost savings and price.

Now please turn to Slide 7. The Applied Water segment's orders declined 17% in the quarter, while
revenue declined 13% as site restrictions continue to impact customers across industrial, commercial and
residential end markets. As regions begin to reopen, we're seeing modest recovery in our book and ship
business in both commercial and industrial markets.

We also had a strong quarter in the North American ag business driven by dry weather conditions. Total
segment backlog grew 1% in the quarter. Geographically, both the United States and emerging markets
revenue declined 14%. However, we saw demand in China begin to recover, growing 2% in the quarter.
Industrial and Commercial end markets in China have been slower to recover than utilities, and our
customers are indicating that it may take several months to fully recover in those end markets.

Operating margin in the segment was 13.4%. Margins contracted primarily due to volume declines and
inflation, partially offset by 570 basis points of productivity and cost savings as well as 100 basis points of
price.

Now please turn to Slide 8. Measurement & Control Solutions orders declined 24% in the quarter,
and revenue declined 17% as the metrology business slowed due to utility workforce availability and
physical distancing requirements, including restrictions on approaching or entering residents' homes.
This is delaying both project deployments and installations of replacement meters. We expect order and
revenue trends to normalize over the coming months as utility workers are able to safely return to meter
replacement and installation. Importantly, our bidding pipeline remains strong, and there have been no
project cancellations.

Despite the near-term challenges, we're very encouraged by the large win we announced with Anglian
Water in the U.K. The $90 million contract demonstrates the competitiveness of our AMI and digital
solutions to drive key international wins. This win, and a robust pipeline of AMI opportunities highlight the
continued commercial momentum and the differentiated value our offerings bring through our combined
digital platform, networking, data analytics and metrology capabilities.

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Total segment backlog grew 3% year-over-year with backlog shippable in 2021 and beyond up 12%.
The segment margin performance was primarily driven by the impacts from volume declines on meter
replacement activity and project deployment delays stemming from COVID-19, while we continue critical
investments to support growth.

Looking forward, we expect meaningful leverage on the upside as revenue growth drives increased
incremental margins from recent large contract wins. With continued commercial momentum and growing
project backlogs, our MCS segment will be a significant source of revenue growth and margin expansion
for the company in 2021 and beyond.

Now please turn to Slide 9. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and total liquidity
of roughly $2.4 billion, driven by the $1 billion green bond offering we issued in June as well as strong
cash flow performance in the quarter. The green bond offering was opportunistic enabling us to lock
in longer maturities at historically low rates while effectively prefunding $600 million of maturities due
in October 2021 at an after-tax cost of less than 1%. This offering was also the latest example of the
importance of linking our financing strategy to our sustainability goals.

Given the strength of our financial position and liquidity, I'll take a moment to note that our capital
allocation strategy remains unchanged. Alongside funding organic investments in key strategic areas, M&A
remains a top priority. And we maintain a healthy pipeline of opportunities, which we closely monitor.

Now turning to cash flow. Our performance in the quarter was very strong. Operating cash flow improved
roughly 50% year-over-year in our free cash flow of $137 million, more than doubled from the prior year.
This was driven by the continued focus and discipline around working capital, the timing of payment on
taxes and the prioritization of our capital spend, which was $44 million in the quarter, down almost 30%
from the prior year. Working capital as a percentage of sales improved 110 basis points year-over-year as
our teams continue to drive hard on collections and payment terms while managing inventories in a very
challenging demand environment.

I'm pleased with our overall cash performance through the first half of the year, and we now expect free
cash flow conversion for this year will be at least 100%.

And with that, I'll hand it back to Patrick.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Mark. The end market dynamics we anticipate going into the third quarter are consistent with
what we saw in Q2. Utilities have remained relatively resilient as expected. However, there is significant
divergence between wastewater and clean water. As Mark mentioned, our wastewater business was down
only modestly. We're seeing continued OpEx spending to service mission-critical needs and continued
execution of capital projects with approved funding.

On the clean water side, the short-term declines were steeper. They were in the mid-teens. We are seeing
some project delays, but not cancellations, and we do expect execution to pick back up when physical
distancing requirements ease. And we've had some very impressive wins, reflective of healthier long-term
trends.

There is considerable discussion about the U.S. utilities CapEx budgets going into 2021. We do expect
modest CapEx softening in the U.S. utilities, but as a leading indicator, we are not seeing a slowdown
in our bidding pipeline for capital projects. It is worth noting for a broader context that only 8% of our
overall revenue is tied to U.S. utilities CapEx. By contrast, OpEx represents 70% of our overall U.S.
utilities revenue, and it remains resilient. In addition, we see healthy multiyear trends in both OpEx and
CapEx in emerging markets, Europe and the rest of the world.

Turning now to industrial and commercial end markets. Industrial didn't slow as much in the second
quarter as originally feared, but it will remain soft while facilities continue to deal with restricted access.
Commercial has lagged industrial, and the book and ship business will remain vulnerable in COVID-19
hotspots.

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Our backlog remains robust. Those distributors who destock in the face of uncertainty are beginning to
rebuild their inventory. We see these end market trends fairly consistent across emerging and developing
markets, but it's clear that China and Europe are showing more resilience in the U.S. as they emerge
sooner from the pandemic. China's recovery which was up 6% in the second quarter is a strong indicator.
Conversely, as the U.S. is still grappling with the pandemic's impact, we remain appropriately cautious.

Now please turn ahead to Slide 12. It's worth noting a few trends that we're seeing more broadly across
the sector. First, there are some fundamentals that COVID-19 has not changed. The most important
is the role that water plays in society. There is perhaps no service more essential than drinking water
and wastewater. As a result, our strategy is as relevant as ever. The global challenges of water scarcity,
affordability and the resilience of our water systems remains front and center. Innovation of all kind is
essential, now more than ever, to addressing those challenges.

While the fundamentals are unchanged, other dynamics are accelerating. Interest in digital adoption
has clearly gained pace as operators seek a step change in their operational and financial resilience.
In a constrained budget environment, they are rethinking how they spend their money. It's become an
operational and economic imperative to consider the benefits of remote monitoring, automated operations
and their decision support systems. It is absolutely front of mind for every utility executive I speak with,
and we're seeing their interest reflected in accelerated quote activity.

We're also seeing a shift in the way that we work with customers every day. The trends are away from
face-to-face interaction and more towards virtual customer engagement across sales, commissioning and
servicing. Because of that, we're making changes to reinforce our competitive strength.

First, as you know, we took a number of structural cost actions across Xylem during the quarter. Second,
we've reprioritized our investments. We're focusing further on the projects that deepen the differentiation
and the market leadership of our portfolio, things such as increasing connectivity and interoperability
across our solutions, and we continue to invest in our highest growth geographies. Lastly, we are
reorienting the way that we work within Xylem. We've accelerated the deployment of the IT platforms
that make remote engagement, distant selling and virtual servicing easier for both our customers and our
colleagues. And we are, of course, assessing the permanent changes that we make to travel, facilities and
distance working, changes that no doubt will have a positive impact on cost and productivity and also on
employee engagement and morale.

We are focused through the pandemic on managing the things that we can control. And we're taking the
actions now that will make us even a stronger competitor in both the near and longer term.

Now with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark for more specifics on our Q3 guidance.

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Given the uncertainties related to the reemergence of COVID-19 across parts of the U.S. and other
geographies and its potential ramifications for the back half of the year, we're not reinstating full year
guidance. However, we do have reasonable visibility through the third quarter, which I'll briefly highlight.

We expect revenue declines of 8% to 12% and operating margins in the range of 11% to 11.5%.
This reflects approximately 200 basis points of sequential margin improvement and year-over-year
decrementals of approximately 45%. The decremental margins are impacted by continued softness in
our high-margin dewatering and North American Sensus water businesses, along with a tough prior year
compared to last year's third quarter, where we had 90% incremental margins on revenue growth.

While we've seen some positive trends in the second quarter, the global economic landscape remains
uncertain, and we are by no means out of the woods. While Europe is showing positive trends towards
recovery, we're closely monitoring the trajectory in the United States. The pandemic's impact varies widely
across emerging markets, from a return to normalcy in China to ongoing shutdowns in India and parts of
Latin America.

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Lastly, I want to provide a little more clarity on the structural cost actions we announced in early June. In
that announcement, we detailed our plans for permanent actions to simplify our operations and increase
our ability to act as one company. These actions help us better serve our customers and afford us long-
term financial resilience. This year, we expect to incur $80 million to $100 million in restructuring and
realignment charges. This predominantly reflects the actions that we announced in early June, but also
some carryover related to prior programs.

We have also provided a summary table on this slide, which details the total savings we expect to realize
in 2020 and 2021 from our announced structural cost programs. As a reminder, that includes savings from
restructuring and realignment actions we initiated before this year as well as savings from actions we
announced in June of this year. In total, we expect to realize approximately $70 million in savings this year
and an additional savings of approximately $80 million in 2021.

Now please turn to Slide 14, and Patrick will close with some final remarks.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

So before we go to Q&A, there are a few other milestones that deserve a mention. The first to touch on
sustainability. We released our most recent sustainability report in June, and I'm very proud of the work
by the team, and it reflects the impact our colleagues have delivered across the company. It shows how
we delivered on our 2019 goals, and establishes comprehensive 2025 targets.

It also reinforces the relevance and the value of a strong sustainability approach even in these difficult
times. We follow that up with the launch of our green financing framework, which underpinned our recent
$1 billion green bond offering. In addition to showing up our financial strength and liquidity, it extended
our commitment that sustainability is at the heart of our business strategy, something we've been doing
and we'll continue to do.

We recently announced that Mark will be retiring at the end of the year. I feel confident in saying he
will take with him the gratitude of all Xylem's stakeholders, but most of all mine. This impact has been
undisputable. And his commitment to both our principles and to delivering value has been constant and
unwavering. We have appointed an outstanding CFO to

[Audio Gap]

Sandy Rowland has been CFO of HARMAN International, both while they were publicly traded and since
becoming part of Samsung. And her [ experience ] has put her right at the intersection of innovation,
technology and disruption. In her Board role at Oshkosh makes her no stranger to capital goods,
manufacturing and muni markets. We look forward to introducing her after she joins us on October
1. Mark is going to be with us through the end of the year, which will ensure an orderly and a smooth
transition.

And lastly, we also announced today that we've appointed 2 new members to our Board of Directors as
part of our normal board succession process. The Board has appointed Lila Tretikov, who is the Corporate
Vice President at Microsoft and a globally renowned technologist. And we look forward to her bringing that
perspective to the digital transformation of our sector. Our second new Board member is Uday Yadav, who
is President and COO of Eaton's electrical sector, and he brings a disciplined global operating perspective
to our growth. These appointments further deepen our Board's diversity, our technology depth and our
global orientation. I'm very pleased that Xylem continues to attract this quality of talent to our purpose
and to our mission as a company.
With that, let's open up to questions. And operator, please lead us into Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And for Mark, I wish you all the best. And this is your second retirement. Do I have that right? Is this
going to be your last one?

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

That is correct, Dean, on both counts.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Great. First question, so the whole premise of the growth opportunity for Xylem really does hinge on
this adoption of digital. And I love seeing this Anglian win that has a digital offering. So if you just clarify
what part of digital that they're taking? And then, Patrick, you also hinted that there -- the front log of
orders also has some digital component to it. And just if you could reflect on where you're seeing traction
there?

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. Yes. Thanks, Dean. So on the Anglian win, certainly, the cornerstone of the deal is a smart network
deployment, which is really centered around AMI metering deployment. But when you look back and
say, okay, what problem is Anglian, and quite frankly, other utilities across the U.K. that we are pursuing
right now as part of the AMP7 cycle, certainly non-revenue water and strong water overflow and overall
affordability are 3 major themes that each one of the utilities are dealing with.

So beyond the AMI metering deployment, there's also a level of data analytics as well as remote
monitoring that is built into that project. In terms of the front log, we do have a number of other deals in
the pipeline. One that we just recently announced, literally live as we speak is we won a large deal just
shy of $60 million, then a [indiscernible] sale. And again, that's also a smart networking deployment. So
we feel good. Again, it's a big market, lots of activity. And I think right now, what I'm most encouraged by
is -- we're not seeing a slippage or a cancellation of projects as a result of pandemic. If anything, in some
areas, it's being accelerated based upon this need for operational due diligence.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. And then the second question is on the outlook and the guidance for the third quarter, and I
appreciate all the detail on Page 13. And you've just clarified the notion here is you've got a pretty similar
revenue sequential ramp, but you're getting 200 basis points of margin improvement. Is that all the
cost saves reading through driving that 200 basis points? So how much is coming through for the third
quarter?

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Dean, that's exactly what it is. It is the benefit of the ramp in some of those restructuring savings in
Q3.

E. Mark Rajkowski

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Senior VP & CFO

And then we also -- Dean. Hey, Dean, we didn't guide for, obviously, the entire back half of the year. So
we didn't talk about Q4, but we also -- we expect even a larger portion of those restructuring savings to
roll through in Q4. And then also, we would expect improving mix as we do see a return to some level of
normality within the clean water side of the utility in terms of being able to do meter installs domestically
here in the U.S.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. And just lastly, this doesn't count as a question. But Patrick, I think you undersold Page 12, that
picture of the head of your India business that's in there in a hazmat suit. I think you should tell that
story.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, I appreciate that, Dean. And yes, Bala is our leader of our business in India. He actually just got
recently promoted to lead our global treatment business. And so that's just 1 example of many where
-- what our team has gone through to continue serving customers and obviously, our customers are the
ones who keep the resources flowing. So it's a joint effort. But we've had a number of -- all these large
deals have pretty much been negotiated on Zoom or some remote platform. We've got customer service
locations where calls are being moved to people's homes. Again, we're not alone in this. But I do think it's
worth calling out that these are not normal times, and our people are really climbing mountains here to
continue to deliver. And I'm really -- I've never been more proud of them.

We had a gentleman sitting in a car for 8 hours waiting to get into a building to close the deal, and driving
hours back and forth from home to get there. So...

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

It was $115 million deal, but it was still heck of a sacrifice.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

Operator

Next question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

I'll echo Dean's comments, Mark, congrats.

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you.

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

All right. Don't disappear on us. Anyway, I have a couple of questions if you entertain me a little bit. The
first one is just, Patrick, can you help me understand what a green bond is? I mean what's -- other than it
sounds good. And I know, obviously, optics matter, too. But what does it mean? Just leave it at that.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll kick it off, and then Mark can go through a little bit more of the granularity. But effectively, it's a
financing structure that is tied to certain KPIs that we have to deliver on in order to be able to achieve that
financing. And it really is tied to our sustainability goals and metrics as a company. But Mark, if you want
to get there?

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

That's right, Patrick. Our 2025 goals. And the way it works is, as we achieve those goals, we get credit.
Those goals are audited, that performance is audited by Sustainalytics. And -- but it's interesting. In
addition to the benefit on the rate, what was fascinating was the amount of demand that we got from
investors who are focused on sustainable missions. And the offering was 5x oversubscribed in those small
parts to the fact that we had almost 50% of those investors as focused on sustainable mission. So not
only do we have an opportunity by executing against our very important sustainability goals to drive the
rate down, but it was very helpful from a pricing perspective.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Okay. Good color. And then, Patrick, you commented on project delays, which I think everybody is seeing,
but does that change the economics of the deal for you guys at all? I mean, does it make it less attractive
because you end up perhaps having lots of projects all having to be done at the same time because
everybody restarts in say, for the sake of argument, January and you're having to put in a lot of overtime
wages? And I mean, how do you cadence that, I guess, is another question to ask and not run into having
all kinds of project challenges?

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And that's predominantly, Scott, that's predominantly a U.S. issue. We've already begun to see -- I
don't want to call it return to normalcy, but if you follow the -- if you like to say, follow the virus around
the world, our businesses have been affected along that same line. So China, Asia Pac already seeing
good growth, signs of recovery. So that's not creating a pinch in our supply chain. As we mentioned
before, we're back up north of 90% in terms of capacity. Europe is also already -- beyond even Eastern
Europe, Europe, broadly speaking, is already showing signs of recovery. So we're kind of working through
that. Demand rebuild as we speak. So it really is centered around the U.S. It's predominantly in the
utility space, Scott, because we mainly deal through distribution and channel partners on industrial and
commercial building. And they certainly are close to the street. It's mainly an inventory replenishment.
And so again, it's going to be more on our supply chain, just to be able to provide that inventory to them.

Then it really -- you're back down to, quite frankly, that roughly 8% of our revenue, that is U.S. utility
CapEx. And that's where you tend to see more of the bigger projects that we focus on. We don't see there
being a big pinch in terms of workforce demand. Our people are still very much engaged. Our supply chain
is very robust. So it's a long way of saying, we don't really see that being a major concern for ourselves.
But I had to go through a bit of deduction, Scott, to kind of help you get there on that piece.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

And Mark, congratulations again. And actually, we don't hope to see you again. We hope you just sort of
ride off into sunset.

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you very much.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

So just a couple of questions here, really regarding the access to sites on the water side. It looks like the
access on the water infrastructure side is maybe coming a little bit more easily or just as less intensive
than it is on the metering side. The third quarter metering guidance is, I guess, a little bit less than what
I would have thought. Could you talk about that sort of the intensity around the need to be at the site for
that?

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a good question, Scott. So I think simply put, first of all, for utility, while all these services
are essential, I would say that they would all agree that the wastewater side of the utility is absolutely
mission-critical. They have little choice but to continue keeping those operations running and deployments
and expanding it separate. Two, I would say, in our water infrastructure business and certainly,
wastewater is much more of a global business today than what we do through M&CS on the clean water
side, which is still largely a North America or U.S.-centric business. I mean we're certainly working hard to
change that. And obviously, some of these international deals will help in that regard. But I would say it's
as much also the geographic focus of our M&CS business.

So on the metering side, those are also critical, and they will get done. We're not seeing projects canceled
at all. But right now, it really is a matter of site access at the home level as opposed to more of the
outdoor and the treatment facilities that we serve on the water infrastructure side. But it really is just --
on the clean water side, it really is just the timing and safety dynamic.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Yes. That makes a lot of sense. I guess my follow-up question would simply be, in terms of the sales
that you're seeing in water infrastructure, I know that a lot of that is the break and fix the OpEx. Is that
a higher-margin business where -- whereby 2 quarters from now, we could be looking at a mix issue
or OpEx versus CapEx? Could you talk about the mix -- the sales mix in water infrastructure? How that
works?

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Scott, roughly 70% of the revenue base is -- and this is in the U.S. It's a little bit different as you
move around the world. But in the U.S., 70% is OpEx related. And you're right, those -- the margins on
that are a little richer for sure. And 30% would be CapEx. In emerging markets, we have more of a mix
towards the CapEx side as we build our position there and build our installed base. So that continues to be
the case. But as we've done that now over the years, we'll begin to see a shift more into the OpEx side.
But it is a richer mix of margin.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

And the margins are typically about 1.5x the size of projects when you get into, again, installed base and
the aftermarket piece.

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's great. If I can just sneak one last one in here. The dewatering business was actually not as
down as I thought it would be. Have you won new placements there? What's the driver?

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It was not as hard hit as we expected, but it was down substantially. I mean, all in, it was close --
over 20% down year-over-year. So we were thinking it might be in the high 20s. So -- and it was really --
a lot of it was industrial driven, but it was down in most of the territories.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean the good news was backlog was up healthily. But again, the overall revenue was certainly
down again considerably in the quarter.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Yes. But not as much as I thought, anyway.

Operator

Our next question is from Ryan Connors of Boenning and Scattergood.

Ryan Michael Connors
Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division

Congratulations. Best of luck, Mark.

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Ryan.

Ryan Michael Connors
Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division

So Patrick, I appreciate your comments on the outlook for -- the intermediate-term outlook for the utility
market, but I wanted to probe on that a little bit just from the perspective of the history. So Xylem wasn't
a stand-alone public company when the last recession hit. But if we look at the earnings releases and
the transcripts from your former parent and then Xylem later on, we had similar talk about resiliency
early on but then Xylem was still seeing headwinds in utility as late as 2012, which was a good 3, 4 years
removed from the recession. So I guess my question is, what is it that's really different this time that
would cause us to believe that, that history is not going to repeat, especially when the portfolio, at least
in water infrastructure, still is relatively similar to what it looked like then? So just looking for any kind of
tangible thoughts you have on what's different this time?

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So it's a very relevant question. And obviously, we are not taking anything for granted here. I mean
we're staying close to the markets and the utility customers and really understanding how they're viewing
the world right now from a funding standpoint. I would say a couple of things are different this time. First
of all, the percentage of our total revenue that is tied to utilities in the U.S., again, is roughly 8% on the
CapEx side. And it really is the CapEx piece that is -- tends to show that kind of fluctuation from a funding
standpoint.

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Two, we do have the M&CS platform on the clean water side. So while we're absorbing some of those
delays right now, clearly, we're not seeing cancellations there. These are projects that are tied to issues of
affordability, nonrevenue water. And certainly, what we're hearing from utility leaders, they don't see those
projects being canceled or killed in any way. So that's a different dynamic than we would have had back at
the time in 11 and 12.

Lastly, I would say, it goes back to that overall percentage of revenue even tied to U.S. CapEx is we've
also got a much larger portion of our revenue today in emerging markets, and we see that demand
continuing to increase considerably.

Ryan Michael Connors
Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful. And then related follow-up is, so much right now seems to ride on the federal
government across the economy. And I guess for Xylem, I wonder if you can comment on how you -- that
outlook you just described in utility. I mean how that differs under a scenario where Congress does bail
out state and local governments versus a more laissez-faire scenario, where things are just sort of left to
run their course and maybe you get some greater budget cuts? How do you handicap that? And how does
your outlook differ in those 2 scenarios?

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So it's a great question. I think, certainly, as we've mentioned before, and I don't think our view on
that's changed, is we certainly are not counting or riding on any kind of federal bailout or federal funding
along the way. As you well know, Ryan, the water sector, generally speaking, in the U.S., has never really
relied heavily on federal funding. It's always been at the state and local level.

So any move there on the positive from the federal government would certainly be upside, but I wouldn't
bake that into people's outlooks or forecast for the business because it will be a while in the coming, but
likewise, there's really no downside in that regard. Now obviously, we're staying close to both utilities and
munis to understand those parts of the country that are feeling more stress at this point in time. But I
would say, we're kind of neutral on the whole federal funding aspect.

Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Mark, congratulations. Good luck.

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Andy.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Just focusing on the cadence that you saw in Q2 because you did mention a very strong June. So can
you elaborate on that in terms of the growth you saw as the quarter developed? And then what are you
seeing in July, especially considering you did mention that you're not reinstating guidance given the recent
resurgence in infections in the U.S.?

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Sure, Andy. Yes, the -- we started off the quarter down mid-single digits and -- yes, mid-teens. I wish it
was mid-single digits. Mid-teens. Matt's like flashing, no -- mid-single digits. But it -- and that was true for

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

-- kind of little bit better in May. And then we had a really strong June, so we ended up down low double
digits, 12%. The -- and as we mentioned, orders were still in the quarter down 9%.

July, we're seeing some modest improvement, and that's encouraging. But as we look at the Q3 outlook,
the fact is we're -- shippable backlog for the quarter is less than 2%. And so we're still going to need a
strong orders performance in the next 2 months. And we think all-in, we're well aligned with what we laid
out in terms of the range, which obviously is tighter than we had last quarter because we had better --
some better visibility.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's helpful, Mark. And I think in June, when you announced sort of the bigger structural cost out, you
also talked about spending $40 million to $50 million to exit certain business activities. I think they seem
to be focused on M&CS as that's where it seems like you're taking the bulk of your restructuring. So could
you just elaborate on what you're doing there, what you're getting out of? And why?

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And it's -- and I think the numbers, it's not quite that large. It's probably in the 20s. And it's a
number of smaller lines of business and just those that aren't as profitable in [ order ], it's core to our
mission moving forward.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Yes. There's nothing -- there was nothing in there that was strategic in terms of we're deciding to exit
something from a material perspective. We wouldn't have even called them out if it weren't for the fact
that it did contribute to some of the cost action or the costs being taken. Therefore, we had to disclose
that. But again, the amount of revenue is a rounding error.

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Yes.

Your next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats, Mark. As everyone's kind of sat here, you will be missed.

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Just to start here, can we -- Patrick, I know that the situation is going to change dramatically between
now and obviously, 2021. But just given where we're at right now with the macro and your view on
developed market utilities is like the appropriate kind of benchmark for now to be like, hopefully, overall
budgets are kind of flattish, maybe CapEx is pressured and maybe OpEx is kind of stable. But like with
lower tax receipts, we're kind of hoping for flat overall spending environment at utilities? Is that like a fair
benchmark right now?

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

President, CEO & Director

I think, Joe, it's too early to tell. I think there is still a lot of uncertainty there. I mean we're encouraged
by the bidding pipeline. We're encouraged by lack of project cancellations. But I really wouldn't want to
start guessing what overall muni budgets are going to be. Again, I go back to what portion of our total
revenue that represents in the U.S. and the fact that we are already seeing some emerging strength in
other parts of the globe. I think it's also -- the focus we have right now with our teams is -- this pandemic
is clearly highlighted for the utilities, the need for greater operational resilience. And obviously, we're
learning a bit about the financial resilience.

But we're really focusing in on with the utilities on helping them do more with a whole lot less and so
that's where they are looking for alternative solutions, the digital dimension of things, and that's really
where we have our teams focused in taking share. Obviously, at the same time, I think it's important
that everyone on this call understand that I think what we're also seeing in our portfolio, and this goes
back to maybe the questions earlier around what's different this time versus before. It really speaks to
the durability and critical nature of our traditional heritage product lines that we don't talk as much about
over the last year or so because of the acquisitions we've done, but they are absolutely core right now and
essential to what the utilities need.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Fair enough. That's good color. And a couple of just related ones on MCS. Just one, are you confident that,
as seen like a market deterioration, we're done with negative margins here? And then two, you guys have
done a lot over the last several years building out a portfolio. It's an interesting mix of applications there.
There's been some issues, some Xylem issues, some market issues. But like curious what you've learned
from this whole experience of building this out? And how you feel about whether that business is ready for
M&A incremental from here?

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So I would say that the -- your question on margins, we certainly expect to be in the black and see
positive margins. We'd expect second quarter to -- the third quarter to be positive. We were just about
breakeven in Q2. So with a little bit of a ramp in terms of some of the deployments, the installations and
just cost actions, we're going to see improvement there. I think -- Patrick, I'm sure of is, I think in terms
of lessons learned, I think the -- what we've learned is adoption of some of these new technologies is a
little bit more challenging, particularly in the developed markets. But I think in terms of the capabilities
that we've built, particularly what we're seeing through this pandemic and the discussions that we're
having with customers, I think we're very pleased with what we have done, the acquisitions we've made
and the capabilities we've built as we emerge from the pandemic because that is going to provide us, we
believe, with a competitive advantage.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So real quick, Joe, on the -- I'll touch on both as well. On the margin comments or question. There, I
think it's important that all understand the level of fixed cost base we have within M&CS given the services
profile in terms of the R&D investments and building out new product development rollouts, et cetera. And
so now some of the restructuring actions we've taken do get at that overhead cost base and so. But our
view on incremental is really unchanged, very attractive incrementals in that business. And so as we see
projects being deployed, return to work, in the second half of the year, we would expect the incrementals
to be quite attractive in that business, so no change in view there.

On the lessons learned, I would also just throw in, Joe, that I think that it does speak to adoption, but
I think it's also the fact that the solutions and value propositions that we're bringing to the sector are
disruptive. And any time that you are aiming to disrupt these, it's going to take longer than what anybody
ever wanted to. It's always going to be a bit harder than what we've been [ anticipating ]. But our views
around the attractiveness and the need for the sector to get disrupted in a positive way, especially around

17

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

the idea of making infrastructure more affordable, that issue remains unchanged. And so it's not going
anywhere. And so I think we want to be appropriately impatient in this regard, but we've got to keep in
perspective as to the long-term journey that we're on here.

Your next question is from Nathan Jones of Stifel.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Congratulations, Mark. And Patrick, if you need somebody to wait in the car for 8 hours for $115 million,
I'm available.

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

You got that.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I wanted to go back to the utility funding question here. So a lot of the utility leaders that we've talked
to are far less focused on state and local government funding and much more focused on the ability to
collect water rates, which as I understand, it is a much bigger part of the funding equation for U.S. utilities
anyway. And they're concerned about things like people not going into cities going to work will reduce the
water consumption there. So places like D.C. or New York City are the areas where those water rates are
going to be collected less and those budgets are going to be a little more challenged. So I wonder if you
could comment on that angle of it. I think people are a little bit too focused on state and local government
and not focused enough on water rates. And then could you contrast that with how utilities are funded
outside of the U.S. versus inside the U.S.?

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Yes. No. So I think you've hit it, Nate, on the U.S. side. You're absolutely right. The biggest concern
that the utility leaders have at this point in time, especially on the clean water side of the equation is,
again, their revenue sources in terms of rate cases, rate collection, et cetera. So I don't really have much
to offer there other than, again, it is a concern of theirs. They do look back at previous cycles and trying
to understand. It is a different dynamic now. And they're trying to get their hands around that. Now
they're also letting me know that they're seeing increased consumption at the household level because
people are staying home.

So some of that just shift from one kind of metering point to another. But I don't want to minimize that in
terms that there will be some potential impact there. They are still -- generally speaking, from the utility
leaders that we are engaging with, they're still pretty confident around their ability to weather this. And it
really is a matter of getting through the second half of this year. I think we'll learn a lot more as they go
through their budget approvals. And that's not all -- it's not all calendar. As you know, a lot of those are --
July 1, October 1, kind of fiscal budgets. And so we're keeping a very close eye on that. But again, I want
to keep in a perspective as to what percentage of our total revenue that represents across the company.

Outside of the U.S., it tends to be -- and we saw this in the last downturn. It tends to be much more
stable, and that's because a large majority of the funding, certainly in emerging markets is at a federal
or state level. I mean it is much more of a -- kind of independent funding and much more -- much less
reliant on the actual revenue collection.

XYLEM INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2020

Yes. I think it's an important point that outside of the U.S. tends to be much more stable on the collection
side. You guys had said on the last call that a more normalized decremental level would be 35%, but we
probably wouldn't say that until the second half of the year. Is that still a target we should be thinking
about for the fourth quarter?

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Nate, absolutely. A couple of reasons: one, we're going to see a bigger ramp, as Patrick mentioned
earlier, in terms of our cost savings. And secondly, we had some items that made the compare -- some
items last year that made the compare this year tougher. So...

Patrick K. Decker
President, CEO & Director

For Q2.

E. Mark Rajkowski
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. For Q3.

Patrick K. Decker
