CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 25, 2021

The data-driven era is being fueled by generation trends, by 5G, hyperscale computing, autonomous
driving and industrial IoT, that are accelerating the digital transformation of several industries. This
requires continued innovation in key areas such as compute, connectivity, storage and data analysis which
is, in turn, driving secular semiconductor growth and design activity across a wide range of end markets.

Before I ask Anirudh to go through the business and product highlights for the quarter, I would like to
remind you that I will be transitioning to the role of Executive Chairman on December 15, with Anirudh
becoming our President and CEO at that time. It has truly been an honor leading Cadence for the past 13
years. I'm very proud of the team's accomplishments and grateful for the confidence and trust that our
customers and shareholders have placed in us. Cadence is extremely well positioned. And as I hand the
baton over to Anirudh, I can't think of no other better to lead the company through next phase of growth.
And I eagerly looking forward to him taking Cadence to new heights. While I will remain engaged with
shareholders, this will be my last earnings call. Thank you very much for your continued support.

And I will now turn the call over to Anirudh.

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

Thank you, Lip-Bu. Our Intelligent System Design strategy leverages our strong computational software
expertise as we expand beyond EDA into new markets. And we are uniquely positioned to capture the
exciting opportunity that Lip-Bu talked about.

As we execute to our strategy, we are especially pleased to see our EDA, IP and system solutions be
increasingly adopted by a growing number of system companies. For instance, Tesla utilized a broad set
of Cadence EDA software solutions and hardware platforms to enable the successful delivery of their
innovative Dojo system.

Delighting customers and accelerating growth requires a relentless commitment to innovation. This
quarter, we launched the Integrity 3D-IC Platform, Tensilica AI Platform, Midas Safety Platform and the
Helium Virtual and Hybrid Studio. We have now introduced 13 significant innovative products this year
across all of our business groups, and these will be key drivers of our future growth.

Let me share some of the business highlights, starting with Digital and Signoff, which had another strong
quarter with 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Our digital full flow, delivering industry's leading quality
of results at the most advanced nodes, continue to proliferate with market-shaping customers and was
adopted by 13 new customers. We are very pleased with the growing momentum of our transformative
Cadence Cerebrus solution that incorporates unique reinforcement learning, AI/ML technology to deliver
significant PPA, power performance and area, and productivity gains.

In addition to Samsung and Renesas endorsement at the time of launch, several market-shaping
customers have added Cadence Cerebrus to their production flows and are realizing great benefits. As
an example, a global mobile semiconductor company used Cadence Cerebrus on their manually-tuned
CPU design to reduce total power by almost 10% and improve timing by over 25% automatically in only
8 days. Additionally, Cadence Cerebrus enabled a marquee mobile system company to reduce the power
consumption of their 4-nanometer design by over 25% and get over 10x improvement in productivity.

We continued growing our business with hyperscaler customers, including a broad expansion of our EDA
software with a marquee hyperscaler that included a significant commitment to our digital products.

Next, I will talk about our verification business, which had a strong quarter with 13% year-over-year
revenue growth. Growing system design complexity and need to get first-time right silicon continues to
drive strong demand for our verification suite, which provides a comprehensive solution across IP, SoC
and system verification, hardware/software regressions and early software development. This momentum
is especially noticeable in our hardware business where customers are deploying a significant additional
capacity as they reap the performance, quality and productivity benefits of our industry-leading hardware
platform.

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 25, 2021

Accelerating adoption of our new dynamic duo, the Palladium Z2 and Protium X2, led by hyperscaler and
global marquee customers drove the majority of hardware orders in this quarter. In verification software,
Xcelium ML, our machine learning optimized logic simulator, delivered up to 5x faster regression, was
adopted by marquee customers in North America and Asia. We launched the Helium Virtual and Hybrid
Studio, a new platform that accelerates the creation of hybrid and virtual prototypes of complex systems,
enabling early software bring-up. Helium was endorsed by NVIDIA, and several other engagements with
leading customers are underway. We also announced the Midas Safety Platform, which is part of the
comprehensive Cadence safety solution, featuring integrated digital and analog safety flows and engines
for faster certification of safety critical automotive design.

Moving on to System Design and Analysis. I'm particularly pleased that this segment, which is driving our
market expansion beyond EDA, continues to deliver strong double-digit growth, increasing revenue by
17% year-over-year as we grow our footprint in several verticals, including aerospace and defense and
5G communications. With 5G and AI/ML applications pushing silicon reticle limits and transistor scaling
slowing down, there is an accelerated move to disaggregate SoC into a heterogeneous set of discrete dies
that can be integrated together with sophisticated packaging technology.

Leveraging over 2 decades of pioneering packaging expertise, we are very excited to have launched
Integrity 3D-IC, the industry's first and only comprehensive platform that ties together our best-in-class
system planning, implementation and thermal timing and power analysis technology, along with a multi-
technology database, all in a unified cockpit. This third-generation 3D-IC solution enables designers
to achieve system-driven PPA with reduced design complexity and faster time to market. And we are
engaged with several leading semi and system houses, foundries and packaging companies.

Our organically-developed system analysis products continued to make good headway. With Clarity, our
electromagnetic 3D simulator displacing the incumbent solution and becoming plan of record at a marquee
hyperscaler. And Celsius, our electrothermal 3D simulator, was deployed at a global marquee system
customer. Our recently acquired CFD solutions also delivered strong results, winning new business with
several automotive and aerospace and defense customers.

And now before I turn it over to John, I want to say a few words about the upcoming CEO transition
on December 15. On behalf of the Cadence Board and our employees, I want to thank Lip-Bu for his
outstanding leadership and his numerous illustrious accomplishments over the past 13 years that have
made a lasting impact on our industry and on Cadence. With his laser focus on creating a highly innovative
and results-based culture, he drove a cultural transformation at Cadence that was rooted in customer and
shareholder success, leading to trusted partnerships with leading customers and delivering shareholder
return of over 3,500%. I'm especially grateful to Lip-Bu for his mentorship and guidance and look forward
to continuing our partnership in our new roles as, along with our talented team, we relentlessly drive to
deliver strong business results and delight our customer and shareholders.

Now I will turn it over to John to go through the Q3 results and present our Q4 and updated 2021 outlook.

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Anirudh, and thank you, Lip-Bu. They say values are like fingerprints. Nobody's are the same,
but you leave them all over everything you do. Your impact on Cadence has been significant and will last
for many, many years to come. It's been a truly remarkable run over the past 13 years, and I feel blessed
to have had the chance to work so closely with you. I've also heard it said that legacy is not something
you do for yourself, but it's something you leave for the benefit of the next generation. And on behalf of all
Cadence stakeholders, I'd like to thank you both for conducting such a smooth CEO transition. We haven't
missed a beat.

Focused execution by the entire Cadence team, combined with broad-based strength across our product
portfolio and customer base, drove another strong quarter of top and bottom line results. We exceeded
our expectations for all key financial metrics, and we are raising our financial outlook for the year.

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 25, 2021

Now let's go through the key results for the third quarter, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $751
million, non-GAAP operating margin was 35.7%, GAAP EPS was $0.63 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80. For
the balance sheet and cash flow, cash totaled $1.014 billion at quarter end, while the principal value of
debt outstanding was $350 million. Operating cash flow was $296 million. DSOs were 40 days, and we
repurchased $110 million of Cadence shares during the quarter.

Next, let's turn to our updated outlook. Our outlook continues to assume that there will be no changes to
the export limitations that exist today. For fiscal 2021, we now expect revenue in the range of $2.96 billion
to $2.98 in billion, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 37%, GAAP EPS in the range of $2.36 to
$2.40, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.24 to $3.28 and operating cash flow in the range of $975 million
to $1.025 billion.

For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $745 million to $765 million, non-GAAP
operating margin of approximately 35%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.53, non-GAAP EPS in the
range of $0.76 to $0.80 and we expect to repurchase $110 million of Cadence stock in Q4.

Our CFO commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well
as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

In closing, I am pleased that revenue growth continues to accelerate with our 3-year revenue CAGR now
approximately 11.5% at the midpoint of guidance. We are expecting approximately $1 billion of operating
cash flow for 2021 at the midpoint, and we are on track to deliver over 50% incremental operating margin
for the year.

As always, I want to thank our customers, partners and of course, our employees for their continued
support.
And with that, operator, we will now take questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.

Joseph D. Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Let me just start by extending my best to Lip-Bu. Maybe I'll begin with the next-generation hardware with
emulation and prototyping. I'm wondering was component availability at all a factor in either meeting
demand in the quarter? Or does component availability factor in at all to the forward outlook, either in
a good way, catching up on maybe things that slipped this quarter, or considering maybe some demand
getting extended into next year?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Joe, this is John. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're delighted with the demand for our hardware
verification systems. And we're building the systems as quick as we can to meet that demand. We're very,
very pleased with the customer reaction and like building the systems as quickly as we can. I would say
it's fair to say that demand is outstripping supply right now, but we're building as fast as we can. And you
can see it in the inventory number, the inventory slightly up.

Joseph D. Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe more of a product or a strategy question. When thinking about 3D-
ICs and the co-design that needs to happen between package and chips being stacked, is it, when you
think about the opportunity for Cadence, as simple as customers adopting the new Integrity platform? Or
is it maybe broader than that and this trend across the industry actually happens to impact and benefit
multiple areas of the Cadence product portfolio?

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

Yes, that's a great question. Let me take that. This is Anirudh. So we believe that 3D-IC is the future,
right? So the road to the future goes through 3D-IC for multiple reasons, which I mean putting multiple
chips on a package, the ability to mix technology, ability to do bigger and bigger systems. And I do believe
that Cadence is uniquely positioned for that. And it affects multiple technology.

Now some of it is because of our history. So we have had a leading platform in packaging for a while with
Allegro and a leading platform in analog with Virtuoso for a while. And then over the last 5 years, we
have done very well in digital. And then if you remember, over the last 2, 3 years, we have done a lot of
investment in system analysis. Like Clarity and Celsius are also critical for 3D-IC given that thermal is a
big challenge when you put these things together. So I believe Cadence is uniquely positioned. And with
Integrity, we put this all together. And it's not just Integrity, it draws into the other parts of Cadence, like I
mentioned.

And then as a comparison, as we work with customers and leading foundries, to do something similar in
other products, it's not even one company, you need 3 or 4 companies to do the same thing. Whereas if
you come to Cadence, we have a comprehensive solution across multiple segments. So I think as 3D-IC
takes more momentum going forward, I believe we are well positioned.

Your next question will come from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc.

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 25, 2021

KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Lip-Bu, it's been an absolute pleasure. Glad to have you on for one more earnings call. So my question,
with the supply chain shortages, we've seen several different automakers, like Hyundai and Volkswagen,
announce intentions to design some of their own semiconductors. But we know that these design cycles
are quite long and it's a multiyear investment. So how do we think about this as maybe an incremental
dollar opportunity versus just market shift from customers taking some of those workloads in-house?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes, Jason, first of all, thank you so much for the kind words. In terms of the global supply chains, we're
monitoring the semiconductor global supply chains very carefully. So far, we don't see any slowdown in our
design activity across our customer base. And then as you know, our product is very much focused on the
R&D engineering, designing the chip system. And this is a multiyear approach. And I mentioned earlier,
the generations drivers have been really driving a lot of increase in the design activity.

And then to answer your question in terms of automotive design cycle, yes, you're absolutely correct. It's
a multiple-year increment. And then lately because of more and more electronics in the automotive, so we
see a lot of design activity like autonomous driving. And I think Anirudh mentioned about Tesla in terms of
driving their AI chips and using our broad-based Cadence tool. That's one good example and many more
coming. And so I think clearly, we're excited about the automotive platform that will create opportunity in
the multiyears to come.

Jason Vincent Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. That was helpful. And maybe my quick follow-up is, I think the automotive customers have been
maybe more vocal, but are you seeing these type of trends in other industries as well in terms of that?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's a very interesting, challenging opportunity time in this whole supply chain. Clearly, for
the automotive industry, it's starting to become very -- realize the whole visibility to the supply chain and
become very important for them. And so in different automotive companies, they experience different
challenges in the supply chain. And we are here to help them in terms of the design, automation and the
whole system level complexity of design and then time to market. And then so we try to be available and
be helpful to them as a design partner and also support them throughout this period. So I think you're
going to see more and more opportunity in the automotive. It's a big platform for us.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from JPMorgan.

Jackson Edmund Ader
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And I'll just quickly echo all the kind words that have already been said about you, Lip-Bu. Yes,
congratulations and looking forward to continuing the relationship. So Anirudh, you mentioned that in
the last few years, digital tools have been driving a lot of growth. And I think you also mentioned that a
hyperscaler this past quarter significantly increased their digital footprint. I'm just curious what tools or at
least what parts of the digital design flow, just from a high level, of synthesis, place and route, what have
you, are actually driving the increased uptick, maybe in the last 12 to 18 months in digital.

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

Yes. Thanks, Jackson, for the question. So I think as you know, like at lower nodes, we have always
believed that integration of the whole digital full flow is critical. So that's synthesis, place and route and

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 25, 2021

signoff. So what we are pleased to see, especially in the last, let's say 12 months, is wider deployment of
our digital full flow. So if we went back like a few years ago, the engagement would start with Innovus,
and that was the leading kind of product that we would do well in. But now I think overall market has
accepted our full flow, and we see more and more signs of that. So that includes synthesis and signoff
along with Innovus. And that is becoming more the norm than anything else.

So to answer your question, not only Innovus does well, but now synthesis and signoff, which is Genus
and Tempus and Voltus. We are pretty happy with the proliferation. And I think that trend is here to stay.

Jackson Edmund Ader
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. Awesome. And then a quick follow-up. John, can we just get -- what is going on with backlog and
the implied booking that's really swung around a bunch this year? Just curious if there were any duration
impacts. Or what we should be reading into in terms of the implied bookings number this quarter?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Jackson, thanks for the question. But I wouldn't read too much into it. Again, it's like the timing of
contract renewals. We had a similar phenomenon in Q1. We would expect to end the year with a higher
backlog in RPO than we started the year. And then that's reflected as well. If you have a look at the
margin guidance for Q4, margin guidance for Q4 is slightly down on what we achieved in Q3 because of
the impact of some hiring and an expectation for higher sales commissions costs in Q4 because we expect
a lot of bookings to come through in Q4.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Pradeep Ramani from UBS.

Pradeep Ramani
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I just wanted to get some more insight on the verification piece. It seems like the verification for
September was flattish to down a little bit versus June. And yet, hardware seems to be doing well. So are
we to sort of interpret that it's more on the software side that you're seeing maybe a little less growth
than what might have been anticipated? Or are you being constrained on the hardware side? I just wanted
to get a sense about the ramp on the hardware side as well.

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Pradeep, this is John. We're actually delighted with the customer reaction to our new hardware systems.
And we're building and installing inventory as fast as we can to meet their demands. But I mean I'd
remind you that Cadence is part of the design cycle. So I mean, it hasn't really impacted us too much with
our customers. And then in relation to your comments on growth, we raised guidance for the year. We're
very happy with growth. We were seeing accelerating growth. When you look at the 3-year CAGR, and
I've called them out in the CFO commentary, it's rounding up to 12% now. It's approximately 11.5%. And
that seems to continue to increase year after year. And that's reflecting strong demand across all lines of
business.

Pradeep Ramani
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And for my follow-up, on the digital IC piece, I mean it has been very strong. Are you seeing
increasing competitive displacements? Or is it more of a market being strong? Can you speak maybe
qualitatively on how you're sort of viewing digital IC going forward as well?

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 25, 2021

Well, it continues to do well, like you saw. And I think it's a combination of things. I mean the market is
definitely growing because of all this design activity, as you can see in these multiple domains. So the
market is growing, and we believe that we are also taking market share. So I would say it's a combination
of both these things driving our digital growth.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.

Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division

Anirudh, both of my questions are for you. But first, on a personal note, Lip-Bu, it's been a pleasure
working with you for the last 13 years and certainly look forward to continuing the dialogue with Anirudh.

So first question, Anirudh, at the Cadence Live Europe Conference a week or so ago, Cadence said, in
one of your presentations, that Allegro had recently undergone a "major overhaul," which we certainly
saw with Allegro X. The question is what's next in terms of anything you might be working on for an
additional major overhaul? We do see this periodically in EDA. For example, Synopsys a few years ago
significantly ramped up its internal investments in synthesis, and they launched their new version of DC.
And I'm wondering, based on what seems to be your internal investment patterns, if you're undergoing
a rejuvenation or reinvestment cycle for your synthesis or what else you might be able to talk about in
terms of any major overhauls.

Secondly, with regard to the ingredients you need to succeed with the computational software strategy,
there was an interesting announcement 2 weeks ago of a relationship between Synopsys and Dassault.
And I'm wondering if you see you're having to partner more for both technical and channel expansion
reasons to succeed in computational software.

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

Yes, Jay, those are both great questions. I think in terms of new kind of -- you said new products or
revamp of existing products, so we are continuously looking at that in all the time. We want to make
sure all our products are doing well. As you can see this year, we have launched 13 new products.
Several of them are improvement of existing products like Allegro X or Sigrity X. So I think this is a
continuous process. As you know, we have a very high investment in R&D compared to our peers. So we
are constantly looking at that, and you will see more things come out, of course, as we go forward.

On the second one, we are confident in our computational software strategy. That's delivering good
results. I think we have a lot of organic ability to innovate, which we demonstrated with Clarity and
Celsius. And at the same time, we are definitely looking at new partnerships that make sense, like you
said, both on the product side and on the go-to-market side. So I think we will talk about them when
they're ready. But Cadence always has a culture of partnering. We partner, for example, with MATLAB.
That was a great partnership at the system level. We partnered with National Instruments when we
bought AWR from them. We have a partnership with Green Hills. So we are always looking for win-win
partnerships, and that continues to be the case going forward.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg.

Gal Munda

Just the first one in terms of the strong margin outperformance again and then kind of thinking about for
the rest of the year, maybe, John, to you. You mentioned that a little bit has got to do with the timing,
a little bit has got to do with investment. But if we're thinking about kind of sustainability of the margin
performance, how much is inability or maybe not being able to hire and invest as much as you'd like right
now versus just the top line really driving the additional scale that you're seeing, if that makes sense?

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 25, 2021

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, great question, Gal. And we're back on track with hiring. I think our hiring performance has been
really, really good. And we're delighted to be recognized on so many of these top 100 places to work
around the world. That's certainly helping us with our hiring activity.

Yes, on the margin side, it's really outperformance on the revenue side like right across all our lines of
business. We thought IP would have a soft middle to the year and it would recover toward the end of
the year, started recovering a bit earlier. But they had a strong finish to Q3, and we're expecting good
things for them in Q4. On the hardware side, again, demand, customer reaction has been tremendous and
demand is really strong there. And on the software side, all lines of business are performing really, really
well.

And like you say, if you look over our contract cycle, over a 3-year CAGR basis, that we're continuing to
see accelerated revenue growth. So on the operating leverage side, we're delighted with the operating
margin performance. Second half of the year includes some double-up on expenses. We did an early
retirement program. But I think the overall business is pretty much -- I mean if you take out the onetime
things, we're operating pretty much at the guide we've given for the year, which is about 37%.

Gal Munda

Got you. And then as a follow-up, just on the top line again, you touched a little bit on the supply chain
issues in the semi. And when you move kind of through the year, you said it's incrementally affecting
the business on the royalties. Now we're talking about the hardware demand being stronger than kind
of the ability to supply. Is there a way to kind of quantify that from your perspective in order to kind of
understand the magnitude of the impact, that kind of demand is there but were kind of limited by the
supply side?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's a very, very small impact to us. Like I say, the majority of our revenue comes from part of the
design cycle. The chip capacity constraints that you're referring to has really impact the production side of
the cycle. And that's where it touches us in terms of royalty revenue. I think last year, royalty revenue for
Cadence was around $50 million. But this year, it will be slightly lower than $50 million, but we expect that
to recover again next year. Yes, so the impact is pretty small.

And the same then on the hardware side, we're happy with our supply chain, and you see inventory
growing a little bit. We talked a couple of years ago about moving from just in time to just in case in terms
of our inventory management. So we carry a lot of inventory. So I think we're well protected, certainly for
the next few quarters, on the supply chain side. But yes, we're very happy with where we're positioned
right now.

Gal Munda

Right. I mean just to clarify, on the royalties, nothing has changed over the last couple of quarters, once
you kind of said that the impact has been slightly down from last year, that's kind of consistent to what
you see.

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

That's right. I mean our IP business is a mix of licensing and royalty business. And chip capacity
constraints from last year could feed into unit production this year and royalties are slightly down. But it's
very, very small in terms of the impact to Cadence on our overall numbers.

Your next question will come from the line of Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities.

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 25, 2021

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

For different reasons, let me extend my congratulations for the next chapter for Anirudh and Lip-Bu. I
wanted to start out by asking about the X2, Z2 products and the step function increase in processing
power that these new tools facilitate. And the way I understand it, it allows customers to not only bring
up hardware but also, in parallel, bring up software. And so my question is, can you give us a sense of the
magnitude of how this increases the potential dollar opportunity with each customer engagement or how it
improves your sort of available market with this new software bring-up capability? And I have a follow-up.

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

Yes, Gary, that's a great question. And you're absolutely right. I mean the reason for doing also Protium
X2 with having the same front end as Palladium is to expand our reach to more and more software build-
up. And this quarter, when we launched Helium, it's for the same reason. So not only we can run RTL,
but with Helium, we can run hybrid models, higher-level models with RTL. All this is for software bring-
up. And historically, I think Cadence has done well in RTL bring-up with Palladium, but not as well. The
market is growing more in the software bring-up. And now we are doing pretty well with the combination
of Palladium and Protium and Helium for software bring-up.

So I think in terms of the market, of course, it's difficult to quantify. But at a high level, I think the market
opportunity is maybe 1.5 to 2x larger once you combine the software and the hardware bring-up together.
Of course, it takes several years to fully realize all this. But I think the market opportunity for Cadence
with Protium, Palladium and Helium is much expanded because of the software.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I appreciate that, Anirudh. And perhaps this is for John, but I want to ask about navigating the China
export restrictions. And maybe if you can give us a sense of whether it's any more difficult or any easier
to obtain licenses to service those customers based in China. And then maybe give us a sense of what the
various puts and takes are there for China revenue growth, or lack thereof, as we sit here in the second
half of fiscal year '21.

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Gary, yes, good question. Yes, when I look at China revenue, I think it's probably easier to look at
China over a 2-year period because last year, with the pandemic impact and the 53rd week impact in Q4,
I think if you look at where we're on track for 2021, it's probably a 30% CAGR in terms of growth in China
since 2019.

We're working our way through all the export controls and everything and all the compliance that's
required, and we have and we will continue to comply with all export control regulations. But the situation
is fluid, and we have to continuously monitor it. But our outlook assumes everything that exists today
remains in place today. We haven't predicted any changes. Of course, if there are changes, we would have
to take another look at our outlook. But essentially, for the sake of guidance, we just assumed that all
export limitations that exist today for certain customers will remain in place for the remainder of the year.
And then for 2022, we'll update you all in 2022 when we give you our year-end results in February.

Your next question will come from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Yes. So Lip-Bu, I guess I've only been around for the last 12 years. But since then, the stock has gone
from $6 to $167. So obviously, very impressive, but I look forward to Anirudh taking it to $4,000 over the

next 12, 13 years. So I guess a question on the supply chain from maybe a little different angle. What
are you seeing in terms of capacity at the foundries? And just curious if you're taking steps to diversify
foundry activity from either geographic or company-specific reasons.

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

Well, yes, that's a good question. I think, like Lip-Bu and John mentioned, we are more on the design
side. So we are trying to make sure that we can serve all our customers as they continue to do all these
designs. And in that process, we work with all the foundries, all the major foundries, of course, in U.S. and
Asia and different parts of the world. So we have a pretty healthy relationship with all the major ones, and
we are encouraged to see more investment in the U.S. So with our overall position, Tom, we are pretty
active with all the major foundries, and we hope to continue that.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

I was wondering more on just the manufacturing of your chips that you design and build and put in your
Palladiums and what have you.

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

Okay. Got it. Yes. So I think the current set of Palladium chips, I mean the Palladium is a big system, so
it has a lot of chips that goes into it. Some of them we buy, and some of them we make ourselves. So
the ones we make ourselves are made by TSMC, which is one of the leading foundries, and we continue
to work with them. And we are designing new systems, the next generation of Z2 and all, and we always
look at all the foundries. But overall, we are very happy with our foundry partners for the Palladium Z2
system.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then curious, are you seeing an impact from COVID in any of the kind of many regions
that you participate in around the world from just more of a manpower point of view?

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

I think it's fair to say that the impact was more like a few months ago. I mean we still have an impact and
we are still mostly, of course, working from home in several parts of the world and we're slowly opening
some offices. But in terms of -- we had a big impact in India a few months ago. I think that has thankfully
improved. And so it's become more of the norm now, and we just continue to work through it. So no new
things, I think, in the last 3 months. Our return to work was delayed a little bit because of Delta, so we
hope to take that up early next year. But other than that, we are working through all the COVID issues.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I'll add my thanks and congratulations to Lip-Bu. My first question, John or Anirudh, is really on that 3-
year CAGR acceleration. And John, I know we've got to wait another 90 days before you give us a full
outlook for calendar year '22. But it's impressive that you guys have seen this acceleration over the last
2 years in the midst of sort of a global pandemic. And if you look at Street consensus numbers for next
year, they've got growth that goes back to that high-single digits. And yet you talked earlier about demand
outstripping supply. Just wondering if you think these double-digit CAGRs are sort of here to stay. And if

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 25, 2021

so, to what extent is this sort of the fruits of your labor and some of your SAM expansion efforts versus
some of the dynamics on the core business?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

John, that's a great question. But yes, I think the nature of our revenue model is such that I wouldn't
expect any dramatic changes in our 3-year revenue CAGRs because 85% to 90% of the revenue is
recurring in nature. So I mean when we calculate 3-year CAGRs, by the end of '22, we'll be including '20
and '21 in that. So you're not going to -- you shouldn't really have a dramatic change. And I think if you
have a look at the CFO commentary, you'll see the kind of step function that we've seen over the last few
years. It's been slowly accelerating, but it's pleasing to see that it continues to accelerate. And that we're
just up over 11.5% now, so rounding up to 12% this year. So yes, very pleased with the way the business
is going.

Again, we will refrain from talking anymore about '22. We need another 90 days just to get through Q4 for
that. But yes, very, very pleased with the way it's going. And because of the recurring revenue nature of
so much of our business, I wouldn't expect the 3-year CAGR to change pretty much.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And Anirudh, I'd love to get your thoughts. Clearly, the U.S. and Europe have, I guess,
rediscovered how strategically important the semiconductor business is. And you're seeing sort of this
push to regionalization of supply. But it's not just about manufacturing, I think that world governments
are going to incentivize sort of IP domestically as well. And so I'm kind of curious if you guys have kind of
thought through or could help us think through what you think the impact to your business will be from
things like the CHIPS Act and similar legislation that's trying to make its way through the EU right now?

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

Yes, that's a great point. And we are eagerly awaiting all the details. But if you -- as you know, in the
CHIPS Act, there is funding for manufacturing, but there's also funding for R&D. And then as you said,
it's not just the hardware or the manufacturing movement, it's also the IP and the software that enables
all these things. So I think we are optimistic about all this investment in different parts of the world.
But I think the details, as you know, still have to be sorted out. But overall, we have a strong portfolio
in multiple geographies. So as there is more investment in U.S. and Europe, I think that is systemically
positive.

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, John, that's a great indication of all the design activity that's going on. I mean we're seeing strong
secular demand across all these generational drivers. We have a great strategy, great portfolio and solid
execution. And hence, everything you mentioned kind of just indicates more design activity globally, and
that's good for Cadence.

Your next question will come from the line of Charles Shi from Needham & Company.

Yu Shi
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

So I want to go back to your prepared remarks, you mentioned about Integrity 3D-IC being the industry's
first and only comprehensive platform for 3D-IC. But a few days ago, your competitor put out a press
release. They said their product is a complete end-to-end solution. I just wonder, how do I kind of
reconcile the 2 different comments around these 2 competing products? And in addition, your competitor,
Synopsys, they announced a strategic collaboration with TSMC. Yet folks obviously did not see a similar

15

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 25, 2021

press release coming from you guys right ahead of TSMC opening their Innovation Platform Forum which
will start tomorrow. So kind of wondered how you're positioning and what's the progress of Integrity 3D
versus your computing platform?

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

Yes. That's a good question. So in terms of Integrity, like I said in my remarks, I think we are pretty
confident of our position. And a lot of the 3D-IC thing, it's not one thing, it's a combination of a lot
of things. So for example, some 3D-IC systems are more package-based. Some are more packaged
technology-based. Some are more interposer-based, which is a more digital technology. But all in
all, Cadence is the most unique platform. We have leadership in packaging with Allegro, with analog
in Virtuoso, with digital in Innovus and all the analysis tools with Clarity and Celsius. And they're all
integrated and best-of-class solutions, okay? So we are pretty confident of our position and the response
we are getting.

And to your question with TSMC, TSMC is a great partner of Cadence. And we are working with them on a
variety of things, including Integrity 3D-IC. And actually, to give you example, one of the leading mobile
customers did a 3D-IC solution with us and TSMC. And one of the key things there was the thermal profile,
and they use Celsius to do silicon validation that Celsius is accurate for, for 3D-IC temperature simulation.
So I think 3D-IC is going to be big, and it requires multiple products and multiple implementation flows,
and we are pretty confident in our position.

Yu Shi
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

And maybe a second question, I'm not sure if this has been asked before since I recently just started
following you guys. I want to ask a question about Intel IDM 2.0 strategy. I know you probably don't want
to be too customer-specific, but the turnaround effort by Intel is too material to ignore, in my opinion. Any
thoughts on how Cadence can do to support Intel's grand turnaround efforts over the coming years? And if
you don't want to comment Cadence-specific, maybe give us some color at the industry level.

Anirudh Devgan
President & Director

Yes. Thank you for the question. I think we are glad to do more with Intel. Actually, they have the Intel
foundry announcement and also some new programs like RAMP-C with the government. And I'll just
quote you what is already public by Randhir, who is the Head of Intel Foundry, he said, "Along with our
customers and ecosystem partners, including IBM, Cadence, Synopsys and others, we will bolster the
domestic semiconductor supply chain." So this is the official comment from Intel. And I think we let them
speak for their strategy, but we are glad to do more with Intel. Thank you.

Operator

Our final question will come from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congrats and best wishes to Lip-Bu and Anirudh from my side as well. For my first one, on your NUMECA
and Pointwise acquisition and just kind of the general expansion into system analysis and CFD, could you
give us a sense how big is it today? How big can it be over the next 1, 2 years? And importantly, when
does that start becoming accretive, right, to the 11%, 11.5% kind of growth model that you have?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, we're very pleased with the M&A integration for NUMECA and Pointwise. They're not hugely significant
from a revenue standpoint right now. We would expect them to be accretive next year.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe as a follow-up, I think, John, you mentioned some higher costs in Q4. Are they
one-off costs? Or do they become kind of the baseline as we start thinking about OpEx for next year?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Great question. I mean I expect slightly higher cost in Q4 versus Q3, partly due to -- we did a bit of
catch-up in hiring in Q3. And of course, anyone we hired in the second half of Q3, we'll have a full quarter
of their expense in Q4 where you didn't have a full quarter of expense in Q3. So there's slight uptick to
that. And then secondly, I expect a little bit more on commission cost because we expect bookings to be
stronger in Q4 because I would anticipate that we will finish the year with a stronger RPO than we started
the year. So expect a good bookings quarter in Q4, which will add a little bit of commissions expense. And
then also, we have slightly higher T&E embedded in the forecast.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

That continues into Q1? I know you're not giving Q1 guidance, but all else being equal, does that become
kind of the baseline for going into Q1?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I feel very good about the continuing operating leverage that, sorry, I don't think there's any near-
term ceiling on operating leverage. I mean you'll see that we're up to 37% now, but it's the fifth year in
a row that we've delivered more than 50% incremental margins. So every dollar of revenue growth from
2017 until now, we're dropping through more than $0.50 of that revenue growth through to operating
income. So as long as we're delivering incremental margins of over 50%, that operating leverage should
continue to rise.

And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back over to Lip-Bu Tan
for closing remarks.

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. It is an exciting time for Cadence with the growing market
opportunities and strong business momentum. Our Intelligent System Design strategy is playing out
very nicely as we benefit from new opportunities in design excellence, system innovation and pervasive
