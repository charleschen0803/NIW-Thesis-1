ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation's quarterly conference call. I need to remind
everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like
to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Kourakos, please go ahead.

Jessica Kourakos
Head of Investor Relations

Thanks, Amy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Fourth Quarter Fiscal
2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; Patrick
Goris, our CFO; and Steve Etzel, our CFO-elect. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the
press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and
our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations
of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next
30 days.

For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the
conclusion of today's call. In addition, we filed an 8-K and have posted supplemental information on our
website related to our new business segments and adjusted earnings definition.

Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the
expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results
may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described
in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.

So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we begin
discussing our results and outlook, I'd like to make a few opening remarks.

I first want to address Patrick's recent announcement that he will be leaving Rockwell to start a new
chapter in his career. In his 14 years with us, the company has continued its long legacy of financial
discipline and delivering superior shareowner returns, and we wish him well in his next pursuit. Many of
you know Steve Etzel, who will be stepping in as CFO on an interim basis. Steve has been with us for
over 30 years and, over these years, has run Investor Relations, Treasury and Corporate FP&A. The Board
and I have full confidence we will reinforce our strong financial framework and continued commitment to
superior shareowner returns. Patrick and Steve are ensuring a very smooth transition, while we consider
internal and external candidates for a permanent successor.

I also want to send my deepest thanks to the thousands of employees who have been working under very
difficult conditions, including the temporary pay cuts we implemented in May to help us preserve jobs
and to serve our customers during the pandemic. These cost actions enabled us to protect our company's
financial strength and allowed us to continue making important targeted investments to drive our future
growth. Now with business conditions gradually improving, we will reverse the temporary pay reductions
by the end of November, 1 month earlier than expected.

In addition, our guidance for next year assumes a return to a fully funded bonus plan. Because of our
employees' hard work and dedication, we have never been so well positioned for what lies ahead. This is
another testament to the type of culture we have at Rockwell, and I couldn't be prouder.

Turning now to our Q4 results on Slide 3. While business conditions remain difficult relative to a year ago,
we are pleased with the steady improvement we're seeing. In Q4, total reported sales declined by 9%

versus the prior year. Organic sales were down about 12% versus prior year but grew 10% sequentially.
Product sales outperformed our expectations and were driven by better-than-expected results in drives
and motion. Motion performance was led by our Independent Cart Technology, where we received the
largest single order in Rockwell Automation's history. We won this multiyear project from the U.S. Navy
based on a need for precise, highly responsive motion control not available with traditional systems, and
on Rockwell's long track record as a dependable U.S. supplier. Independent Cart provides a new way for
us to add value and drive growth. You'll be hearing more about it and other innovative technologies at our
upcoming Investor Day on November 17.

Turning to Information Solutions & Connected Services. Organic sales were up low single digits versus
prior year. IS/CS orders grew double digits over the prior year in both software and Connected Services.
IS/CS sales reached approximately $400 million in fiscal '20 on an organic basis, and we're well in excess
of that when including all of our recent inorganic investments.

Demand for software sold as a result of our PTC partnership is also increasing rapidly as we enter the new
fiscal year, and we're very happy with the recent extension and expansion of this relationship. Together
with PTC, we added over 200 new customer logos in fiscal 2020, and deal sizes in our Information
Solutions software business continue to grow. The synergies of our combined offering are very evident to
customers.

In Connected Services, our recent Kalypso acquisition is doing particularly well and is helping us further
differentiate. Kalypso was already contributing to some large competitive wins, and they just had the
best orders quarter in their history. Total sales include a 3 point positive contribution from inorganic
investments, led by our Sensia joint venture, along with the Kalypso and ASEM acquisitions. Total backlog
in the quarter grew double digits versus the prior year and grew high single digits on an organic basis. Our
Q4 solutions and services book-to-bill was 0.87 and full year book-to-bill was over 1. This solutions and
services book-to-bill does not include the large Independent Cart order we received from the U.S. Navy.

Turning to profitability. Strong segment operating margin performance of over 20% in the quarter was flat
with last year on lower sales, underscoring our increasing business resilience. Free cash flow was also very
strong, reinforcing our solid balance sheet and liquidity position.

Let's now turn to Slide 4, where I will provide a few highlights of our Q4 organic end market performance.
Our discrete market segment declined approximately 10%, with automotive performing better than we
expected, driven by stronger MRO and project sales. Among the more notable projects in the quarter was
a significant OT cybersecurity win in Europe with one of the major German car companies. And in electric
vehicles, we saw momentum continue in the industry with battery manufacturers and brand owners. We're
excited by recent announcements from both new and established automakers as a focus on production of
compelling new EV offerings.

In semiconductor, we had another very strong quarter and grew high single digits versus the prior year.
This vertical is benefiting from a variety of secular tailwinds, such as the rise of smart devices and the
resulting Internet of Things along with the need for faster data centers and the adoption of 5G wireless
technology. In addition to facilities management, which has been a strong foundation for us, we see an
opportunity for our material handling technology as well as our software.

In e-commerce, we had a significant expansion win at [ Kloosterman's ], one of the largest and most
important suppliers to the global e-commerce industry. This is another industry with long-term secular
tailwinds that we'll continue to invest in automation and industrial software to support its tremendous
future growth.

Turning now to our hybrid market segment. This segment declined a little less than 5% and outperformed
the discrete and process industry segments. Food and beverage and life sciences each declined low single
digits for both the quarter and for the year. Packaging OEMs had another strong quarter and delivered
double-digit growth versus the prior year. We believe these markets will outperform in fiscal '21.

Eco-industrial outperformed other industries in the quarter, driven by growth in water, where we continue
to benefit from a differentiated offering that integrates control, power and industrial software. Tire and

rubber was down double digits but performed in line with our expectations. In the quarter, we had key
wins on important strategic accounts, including Cooper Tire which continues to strengthen its global track
and trace capabilities to support the company's long-term growth plans. They chose FactoryTalk software
because of our strong MES and analytics capabilities and our differentiated ability to connect to both
Rockwell and non-Rockwell control platforms.

Once again, our strong software portfolio, our ecosystem, our best-of-breed partners and our expertise
in connecting diverse manufacturing environments were all important reasons Rockwell won this very
competitive project with Cooper Tire.

Process markets were down approximately 20%. Oil and gas was a little weaker than we expected, but
that was partially offset by better-than-expected performance in most other process markets like mining
and pulp and paper. Sensia held up fairly well during the quarter and continues to demonstrate their
competitive differentiation.

Turning now to Slide 5, and our organic regional sales performance in the quarter. North America
organic sales declined by 12% versus the prior year. Business conditions improved through the
quarter, particularly in products, where orders significantly exceeded our expectations. While our large
Independent Cart win was part of that result, we also saw great software orders within Information
Solutions that more than doubled versus the prior year, creating strong momentum entering the new fiscal
year.

In EMEA, sales declined 12%, largely due to CapEx delays. These were partially offset by strong growth
in water. We also saw growth in life sciences and PPE-related machine builder business. Sales in the Asia
Pacific region declined 9%, largely due to declines in end user business within automotive and mass
transit. Double-digit growth in mining and life sciences partially offset those declines. China sales declined
but orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. Latin America declines were led by mining
and oil and gas.

Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year. It's an understatement to say that fiscal
'20 turned out very different than the plans we discussed together at a great Investor Day during an
incredible automation fair in Chicago last November. The shadow of the pandemic soon created unique
challenges, but I'm proud of our ability to respond while taking big steps forward in the execution of
our strategic vision. We kept the safety of our employees at the top of our list and continue to provide
dedicated service to our customers, many of whom are producing the food, water, protective gear and
medicine that keep us going.

The pandemic has focused us all on what's truly important. We took thoughtful actions to manage costs
through this pandemic but, at the same time, protect strategic investments, including some very big
internal development projects. And you can see those investments drive the performance of our software
business, which reached over $500 million in revenue in fiscal '20 and was one of the best-performing
areas of our business in both orders and sales this year. We deployed over $500 million for inorganic
investments that contributed almost 4 points to our top line growth, and we deployed over $700 million in
cash for dividends and repurchases enabled by our strong free cash flow. I'm tremendously proud of what
we've accomplished in fiscal '20, and I'm excited about the resulting momentum as we enter fiscal '21.

Turning now to our outlook on Slide 7. As I said earlier, we saw strong sequential momentum exiting
the year. Industrial production is projected to grow in the second half of our fiscal year. So it may take a
couple of quarters for us to climb back to year-over-year sales growth from the Q3 trough in fiscal '20.
We expect double-digit year-over-year growth during our third and fourth quarters. Of course, we're all
closely monitoring global infection levels related to this pandemic, but we are not assuming a widespread
shutdown of customer manufacturing operations. We expect reported sales to grow about 7.5% at the
midpoint of the guidance range, including 5% of organic growth and over 1 point of growth from our fiscal
'20 and fiscal '21 acquisitions to date.

In addition, we are adopting annual recurring revenue as an important metric for the company and have
added ARR as a performance metric in our incentive compensation framework beginning this year. ARR
is expected to grow double digits in fiscal '21 after showing over 6% growth in fiscal '20. This is further

evidence of our ability to build an even more resilient business model. Adjusted EPS is expected to reach
$8.65 at the midpoint, which is up 10% from last year's fiscal '20 results. We're targeting free cash flow
conversion of 100%.

A more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 8. I won't go into the details on this
slide, but as you can see, we expect positive organic sales growth in all of our key end markets next year
with the exception of oil and gas.

With that, let me now turn it over to Patrick, who will elaborate on our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020
financial performance. We'll then have Steve discuss our fiscal 2021 outlook in his remarks. Patrick?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial
information. Sales segment margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were all better than expected in the
fourth quarter mainly as a result of better organic sales growth and productivity. Organic sales improved
as the quarter progressed and were up 10% sequentially versus Q3. Compared to last year, Q4 organic
sales were down 12%, and acquisitions contributed just over 3% to total growth. Currency translation was
a smaller headwind than expected and decreased sales by 0.3 points. Overall, company backlog increased
year-over-year in the quarter. Backlog for our short-cycle products was up double digits from a year-over-
year and sequential perspective, even excluding the very large Independent Cart order Blake referred to
earlier.

Segment operating margin was 20.2%, the same as last year. The negative impact of lower sales was
partially offset by a combination of temporary and structural cost actions. Fourth quarter results included
about $10 million of restructuring charges, which are expected to yield over $15 million in additional
annualized structural cost savings. Most of these savings will be realized in fiscal '21. General corporate
net expense was $22 million, pretty much in line with what we expected. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted
EPS of $1.87 was better than expected mainly as a result of better organic sales, productivity and a
slightly lower tax rate. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.

The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%, a bit lower than we expected due to a slightly
different geographic mix of our pretax income. Free cash flow performance remained strong. We
generated over $300 million of free cash flow in the quarter, well over 100% conversion on adjusted
income. Note that this result includes a voluntary $50 million pretax contribution made to the U.S. pension
plan. This voluntary pension contribution was not reflected in our prior guidance.

Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. Organic sales
in both segments improved significantly compared to last quarter. Both segments were up about 10% on
an organic basis compared to Q3, though organic sales remained lower compared to last year. Segment
margin of both segments increased over 300 basis points compared to Q3 mainly due to higher organic
sales, but also as a result of cost control, including a full quarter benefit of our cost reduction actions and
generally improving operating efficiencies. Compared to last year, Architecture & Software margins were
up 100 basis points despite the impact of lower sales mainly as a result of our cost actions, including lower
incentive compensation. Segment margins for the Control Products & Solutions segment declined 60 basis
points compared to last year, with cost actions offsetting most of the impact of lower organic sales.

The next slide, 11, provide the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal '19 to Q4 fiscal '20. As you can see, core
performance was down about $0.15 on a 12% organic sales decline. This implies core earnings conversion
that is excluding the effect of acquisitions and currency of a little below 20%, which is a bit better than
the outlook I shared with you in July. A positive adjusted EPS contribution from acquisitions is offset by
unfavorable currency impacts.

Slide 12 provides key financial information for full year fiscal '20. After a good start to the fiscal year,
we experienced significant year-over-year sales decline in the second half as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. Organic sales declined 8% for the fiscal year. Our cost reduction actions protected key
investments and helped to partially mitigate the impact of lower sales. We selectively increased

investments in some of our highest priority areas. R&D expense was about flat compared to fiscal '19 and
R&D as a percent of sales increased further to 5.9% of sales in fiscal 2020.

Full year segment margin remained at about 20% compared to record 22% segment margins last year,
and adjusted EPS was down 11%. Free cash flow performance remained strong, and excluding the
$50 million voluntary pension contribution in fiscal '20, was flat compared to last year. Free cash flow
conversion was over 110% of adjusted income. And finally, return on invested capital remained well above
our target of over 20%.

Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to mention that we deployed about $1.3 billion of capital towards
acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2020. Our capital structure and liquidity remained
very strong. At September 30, our fiscal year-end, cash on the balance sheet was over $700 million, and
our total debt was about $2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we paid off the $400 million term loan that
we executed earlier in the year, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at September 30 was 1.0.

With that, Steve?

Steven Etzel

Thank you, Patrick. Moving to Slide 13, product order trends. This slide shows our daily order trends for
our products, which account for about 2/3 of our overall sales and represent our shorter cycle businesses.
As we expected, order intake for products continued to improve during the quarter. Our guidance for fiscal
2021 assumes this trend will continue. Daily product order performance through October continued to
improve on a year-over-year basis, down low single digits. Solutions orders are recovering slower than
product orders.

Let's move on to the next slide, 14, guidance for fiscal 2021. As Blake mentioned, we are expecting
sales of about $6.8 billion in fiscal 2021 up about 7.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic
sales growth to be in the range of 3.5% to 6.5% and about 5% at the midpoint of our range. From a
calendarization viewpoint, we expect first half organic sales to be down compared to fiscal 2020, followed
by a stronger second half with organic sales up mid- to high-teens. As a reminder, first half fiscal 2020
organic sales were about flat, followed by double-digit declines in the second half. We therefore expect
easier comps starting in Q3 of fiscal 2021.

We expect segment operating margin to be between 20% and 20.5%, probably at the higher end of that
range. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes full year core earnings conversion, which excludes the
impacts of currency and acquisitions of between 30% and 35%. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect
to offset a $150 million year-over-year headwind related to fully funding our incentive compensation
and reversing fiscal 2020 temporary cost reduction actions with additional productivity. We expect the
full year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 14%. This includes a 300 basis point benefit related to
discrete items, which we expect to realize late in the fiscal year. Our underlying adjusted effective tax rate
is expected to be 17% to 18%.

As disclosed in our earnings release, we are modifying our definition of adjusted EPS beginning in fiscal
2021. Under the new definition, we are now also excluding purchase accounting, depreciation and
amortization expense from adjusted EPS. This has the effect of increasing adjusted EPS by approximately
$0.20 on a full year basis. Please note that we filed an 8-K this morning that provides historical
information reflecting the new definition of adjusted EPS as well as recast historical information for our
new operating segments that we announced previously.

Our adjusted EPS guidance range on a new basis is $8.45 to $8.85. This compares to fiscal 2020
adjusted EPS of $7.87 on the new basis. On an apples-to-apples basis, at the midpoint of the range,
this represents 10% adjusted EPS growth on about 5% higher organic sales. We expect adjusted EPS
to improve throughout the year and anticipate first quarter fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be lower than
our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter performance primarily as a result of a $0.30 sequential headwind related
to increased incentive compensation expense and the reversal of our temporary cost actions as of the
end of November. Finally, we expect full year 2021 free cash flow conversion of about 100% on adjusted

income. This assumes $150 million of capital expenditures and a $50 million voluntary pretax U.S. pension
contribution.

A few additional comments on fiscal 2021 guidance. Corporate and other expense, which we previously
referred to as general corporate net expense, is expected to be around $105 million. Net interest expense
for fiscal 2021 is expected to be between $90 million and $95 million, a little lower than fiscal 2020.
Finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares.

The next slide, 15, provides the adjusted EPS walk from fiscal 2020 to the fiscal 2021 guidance midpoint.
Moving from left to right. Fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS was $7.68 on the old definition. Next, you see the
$0.19 impact of the new definition of adjusted EPS. So fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS on the new basis was
$7.87. Core performance is expected to contribute about $1.90. This includes the benefit of higher organic
sales as well as the benefit of our cost reduction actions. Reinstatement of the bonus and reversal of the
temporary cost actions together will be a headwind of about $1.15. As mentioned last quarter, we expect
these headwinds to be offset by productivity, which is in core.

Currency forecasts project a weaker U.S. dollar compared to fiscal 2020, which should contribute about
$0.10 to EPS. The higher tax rate is expected to be about a $0.15 headwind. Acquisitions made during
fiscal 2020 and so far this year are expected to add about $0.10. Note that Sensia is now in core as
October 1 was the 1-year anniversary of the formation of that joint venture. As mentioned, at the
midpoint of our guidance range, adjusted EPS is $8.65.

Moving on to the next slide, 16. I'll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. You may
recognize this slide from our last Investor Day. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our
first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we
focus capital returns to shareowners through our dividend and then repurchases. Our capital deployment
plans for fiscal 2021 include dividends of about $500 million. As a reminder, we announced a 5% dividend
increase last week. Consistent with our past track record, we expect our remaining capital deployment
to include a balance of inorganic investments and share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases on
October 1, the beginning of our fiscal year.

In summary, our guidance assumes a continued sequential improvement in organic sales performance.
Cost actions are expected to offset the significant headwind of reinstating incentive compensation and
reversing temporary cost actions, and we expect about 10% adjusted EPS growth and continued strong
free cash flow conversion.

Turning to Slide 17. I'll finish with a comment about our new segment structure, which is effective for
fiscal 2021. As a reminder, our first quarter fiscal 2021 results will be reported in the new 3 segment
format as shown here.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start the Q&A.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Steve. We continue to see our customers take steps to increase their resilience, agility and
sustainability. Resilience includes investments to reduce single points of failure with the growing list of
companies announcing plans to build or expand North American operations. Our strong market share in
the U.S., Mexico and Canada make us a natural beneficiary of these plans. Other measures to increase
resilience include increased automation, traceability and remote monitoring, which are all Rockwell's
strengths. We're making investments in our own operations, which we'll showcase during next week's
Investor Day.

Our contribution to operation's agility is demonstrated by our great results in consumer and life sciences
packaging equipment and the growth of our software to manage the increasingly dynamic SKUs offered
by our customers. The pandemic has prompted new food and beverage packaging formats, along with
quantities of testing kits, therapeutic drugs and hopefully, very soon, doses of vaccines. Quite simply,
these cannot be manufactured at the necessary scale, safety and quality without automation. We're proud

of the role our innovation is playing at Pfizer, Roche and many other companies as we help the world
recover.

The need to increase the sustainability of industrial processes is always increasing. Clean drinking water is
one of the reasons our eco-industrial focus is so important for the future, along with electric vehicles and
every day ways our products reduce energy consumption in every industry. This expanded value gives us
optimism for the coming years. In fiscal '21, we are guiding to high single-digit reported growth, paced
by our highest margin segment. This results in guidance that also includes double-digit EPS growth. I'm
looking forward to telling you more about our plans next week with the help of great customers, partners
and a very talented Rockwell leadership team.

With that, let me pass the baton back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session.

Jessica Kourakos
Head of Investor Relations
Thanks, Blake. [Operator Instructions] Amy, let's take our first question.

Question and Answer

Operator

Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

And congrats, Patrick, good luck. You'll be missed, I'm sure.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Scott.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

This contract with the Navy is interesting. I mean I haven't heard you talk about Independent Cart in a
while. What is the U.S. Navy doing with the technology?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Scott, we can't talk in specifics about the particular application, but I can tell you that Independent Cart in
general allows for more precise motion control than some of the traditional methods of servo ramps and
other types of technology. So with the kind of acceleration and deceleration profiles that are needed for
some of these high-performance applications, Independent Cart was really a differentiated solution. It also
has to operate, and as you can imagine, very difficult environments.

The final point is that while we don't talk as much about our government business. Now Rockwell has
been a trusted U.S. supplier to the government for a long time, and so some of these premium high-
performance applications were a natural fit.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Okay. Makes sense. And then you mentioned, Blake, PTC helping you add 200 new customer logos. What
-- I know that it might be a little bit varied. But is there any general theme around what type of new
customers you're able to bring in on any particular end markets, geographies, that type of thing that you
could point to?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Scott, one of the things that we've really been proud of our partnership with PTC is the diversity of
customers and geographies that we've been able to penetrate with the combined offering. So while food
and beverage and consumer-facing industries, as they are large for Rockwell's overall business, are the
source of a lot of the applications, it goes across automotive and mining as well as many of the other
industries that we talk about all the time.

It gives us new ways to win in these and some of the things that we're most excited about that we've
talked about before are that it's not just on top of Rockwell control systems, about half of these
applications are going on top of competitive control systems. So it's a new way to add value and to be
meaningful in those customers' digital transformations. It's really across the various industries and across
the geographies. We have wins in every geography we serve.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Congratulations, Patrick.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

John, thank you.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Welcome. Do you guys expect the cadence of the 10% core sequential sales to be sustained throughout
the year? I realize I'm aware of your mid-single-digit core year-over-year, but can you talk to me about
just sort of the sequential cadence? And do you expect that to sustain itself or if not even perhaps
accelerate over the balance of fiscal '21 as part of your guide?

Steven Etzel

John, this is Steve. We expect a gradual sequential recovery throughout the year, including into the first
quarter. And as we said on the call, that implies a first half decline year-over-year and then a second half
year-over-year growth rate of mid- to high-teens.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. What I would also add, John, is that we did see good orders in October in terms of improvement. So
particularly on the products, that was an encouraging sign as we entered the year. We have to say that
services and solutions order recovery is lagging behind those product orders, but products are really the
leading indicator that we look at.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Right. So -- right. Understanding over year, but does that translate into -- like how does that translate
in terms of your expectations in terms of sequential improvement? Like we did 10% this quarter. Do you
expect that to slow in the December and March quarters and then tick back up? Or just a little bit more
color on how you think of the sequential trend.

Steven Etzel

Yes, John, I think it's best to think of it as a mid-single-digit quarter-to-quarter sequential growth in fiscal
'21.

John George Inch
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay. Good. No, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, on your Page 15 on your EPS walk, where did
the structural actions fall? I think you said in core. I just want to confirm that there's no structural actions
that are sort of offsetting the temporary return like you've split it.

And maybe I remember, Patrick, last quarter, you talked about, you're going to take out some redundant
facilities, maybe some sales offices and stuff. Is there a way to quantify the carryover of the structural
impact in EPS? So I see the $1.15 headwind. What is that mapped against in terms of the structural take-
out that is in response to the pandemic, right? Like would have been...

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

John, the $1.15 headwind that you see there on the walk is this is a bonus reversal -- sorry, the bonus
reinstatement and the temporary cost reversal. That bonus is about $115 million in and of itself for the full
year. I will point out, by the way, as it relates to the bonus, it's obviously a full year headwind. The biggest
headwinds we'll see on that year-over-year bonus is in the second -- I'm sorry, yes, the second quarter.
But each quarter, we'll have some headwind.

In terms of some of the structural savings and so on, that -- on that bridge, that's all in core. We have
about $60 million of structural savings which relate to restructurings that we've taken over the last several
quarters, including in Q4. And then there's some other cost reduction actions through cost improvement, if
you will, through increased efficiencies in our plants and so on as volume increases.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Thanks, Patrick, for all the help and look forward to working with you again, Steve. Perhaps the first
question just around the top line again. I understand that I think you called out good orders and good
backlog trends in the short-cycle business and products.

But want to perhaps to focus on that solutions and service and process piece. I think the process sales
were down 20% or so in Q4. You're guiding for low single-digit growth in the year ahead. Maybe help us
understand how quickly do you get to that return to growth in fiscal '21 and when we could start to see
that solutions and service book-to-bill look a bit healthy. I think it was down year-on-year, the book-to-bill
in Q4.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

That's right, Julian. Typically, the book-to-bill is down for solutions and services in Q4 as we see normal
seasonality increase the amount of shipments in the quarter. That being said, we are expecting orders to
pick up in the first half of the year. Oil and gas is probably the most subdued. And as we talked about in
some other areas like mining and pulp and paper, the activity is a little bit more vigorous. We continue to
focus on the OpEx expenditures in oil and gas for Sensia.

I would also say, if we look at the typical performance of our various businesses, as we come out of a
downturn like this, products are almost always going to lead the solutions and services orders. We've
seen that repeated over many years and multiple cycles. So we're not surprised by this. But at the end
of the day, you have to compete and win for each order that's up. There's still business out there. We are
confident that, that activity is going to increase, but we have to be on the winning side as that business
comes up, and that's what we're focused on not only with our traditional resources, but with some of the
new acquisitions that are really helping in that space.

And I mentioned also Kalypso but there are other unsung heroes. When we look at some of the
acquisitions in OT cybersecurity with Avnet and Arlo. When we look at ILIAS tech and the ability to quote
even more competitively for the delivery of software-based projects. Those are all going to help us recover
just as fast as possible as those projects increase in frequency.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then maybe, Blake, just a more strategic one. And perhaps we'll hear more about this at the Investor
Day, but it did seem as if the broadening of that strategic alliance with PTC was quite substantive that
you talked about a couple of weeks ago. Maybe give us some background as to why the relationship now
includes PLM and SaaS and maybe how your own perspectives on the benefits of co-offering PLM may
have shifted, if at all?

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. Julian, a couple of aspects of the expanded relationship. The starting point is that we have a great
foundation. The pace of competitive wins is picking up. I mentioned before that it seems to be catalyzing
the increased size of all of our software wins. So not just what we're doing directly with PTC but on the
MES side as well, for instance, and in our own FactoryTalk Analytics offering.

Another specific example of the way that the partnership is evolving is that we're focused on annual
recurring revenue now. So it's not just about the new annual contract value of wins, but it's also about the
total value of the business, including the renewals. And of course, that's absolutely essential for us to be
on the same side of the table as we're both focused on increasing that recurring base.

Specifically, with respect to PLM and Onshape and some of their offerings, we see the opportunity to help
pull-through PTC in some of these digital thread opportunities. We preserve an open approach and respect
customers' installed base. But having the ability when a customer is looking at PTC, the ability to include
that in the digital threat offering is proving to be very valuable, and with the recent acquisition of Kalypso,
we have formidable capabilities respect to digital thread. So this is just another tool that we have at our
disposal, and we continue to look for meaningful ways to integrate PTC technology with our own offering
not just on the software side but also, really importantly, on the way that data is pulled from the control
and brought up to that information layer.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Two for me. First, just kind of on the software and control side. Thanks for the timely restates. Kind
of interesting, right, Software & Control kind of in the 2 worst quarters of the pandemic. Basically,
they performed in line with Intelligent Devices. I wonder if you could just speak to your view of kind of
resiliency in that business over time. And as part of that, if we're going to talk ARR, can you baseline us
on what it is for the fiscal year 2020, so we are kind of level set here?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Jeff, I'll make a couple of comments and then Patrick and Steve may add to that. I mean Software
& Control includes the essential heart of a control system, the control function, whether it's based in
hardware or software or a combination of the 2, is processing the inputs and changing the states of
outputs. And that's going to remain a persistent part of control systems in all of the industries that we
serve.

We see some evidence of that, as we talked about the great performance in packaging OEMs,
CompactLogix really performed quite well relative to the rest of the control during the last couple of
quarters. So we think that, that's an essential functionality. And regardless of where the execution point
moves from hardware and firmware to pure software or back, depending on customer preferences, we're
confident that we can continue to perform very well there.

On the software side, the pure software side, we are increasing the focus on ARR. It's a little bit over 5%
of sales currently. And as we talked about last Investor Day, and as we'll talk about again next week, the
goal is to bring it to 10% and more in the next few years. And we think we're on a good path to do that.

I should add, it takes all hands on deck to make that happen. It starts with great software, either that
we're developing ourselves or that we're buying. It also includes increasing our selling capabilities and a
significant part of our recent investments is adding sales, who have a specific focus on software, and also
the infrastructure within the company to make sure we do a great job of processing those orders and that
we're decreasing churn rates and so on. So it's really the full company on board and an integrated effort to
grow that.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And then separately, just on the decision to go ex amort, just kind of interested in the philosophical
decision there. I mean we've seen it happen at other companies. So certainly, you're not alone. Most of
the places that happened, there was kind of a investor push for it because the amortization was quite high
relative to GAAP EPS, and there was a clear disconnect here.

What should we if anything, glean from making this adjustment, right? It's kind of 2% of earnings. I guess
my read would be we've got a much more active M&A pipeline coming at us. But any color there would be
greatly appreciated.

Steven Etzel

Sure. This is Steve. Yes, we did a lot of benchmarking. As you said, we did get a lot of investor input as it
relates to this. We obviously have been on a path to doing more acquisitions than perhaps in our history.
We have a goal of growing top line more than 1 point per year from acquisitions, and we have been doing
more. And we thought now is the right time to make the change and come more in line with a lot of other
companies that we compare ourselves to.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So just thinking about kind of the sequential or, I guess, the year-over-year performance may be a little
bit better because John kind of got you on the sequential side. 2Q last year, you guys outperformed almost
everybody by a lot. Anything you guys want to kind of highlight as far as the project comps there at all in
the second quarter that we should take account of in our models?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Steve, I think we're in a period of time in general, where things are going to be highly variable by
geographies and by end markets and by end user OEM split. So if we're looking at top line there, you're
correct that in Q2, it looks like our performance last year outpaced pretty much all of our competitors. And
during this time, relative position and amount of business in different parts of the world, I think, are going
to have a big impact on the results. In general, the theme is, of course, towards recovery. And as we said,
as we pull out from the Q3 trough, we expect gradually recovering conditions and a return to strong year-
over-year growth in Q3 as industrial production returns to growth and as we have easier comps.

The other point I would make regarding Q2 that you mentioned in fiscal '20, it was broad-based.
Automotive, I think, was a bit of a positive surprise, but it wasn't just automotive. There were a number of
industries that were positive in the quarter.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just -- yes, go ahead, sorry.

Steven Etzel

I'm just going to elaborate a little bit on what I mentioned earlier since you brought up Q2, but of our
bonus headwind of $115 million for the full year, the headwind is going to play out by quarter, something
like $10 million headwind in Q1, $45 million to $50 million in Q2 and approaching $30 million per quarter
in Q3 and Q4.

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

Okay. Great. And then just lastly on these new segment breakouts. On the Software & Control side, I
mean, I think the majority of those sales are kind of Logix and the PLCs. Those margins in, I think, '19 at
the peak were 30% for that segment. Given that the vast majority of that segment is the hardware, can I
assume that, that hardware sale is pretty high margin for you guys?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, yes. No question that Logix hardware is good margin for us. If you do the math and you look at what
we provided on fiscal '20 breakout by segment, about $1.7 billion in Software & Control and all of the
software is in this segment so that we said, is over $500 million in fiscal '20 of the pure software. And then
I should also mention that this is the segment that is currently attractive, the majority of our investments.
Whether it's in Logix or it's in the software development as a percentage of sales, this segment would
have the highest investment.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Right. And then PTC-related sales that come through there. I think you've said will flow through at your
kind of normal incremental margin. So you're basically booking similar margins on those PTC sales, if you
will.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Steve, the way you can think about it, we -- if we package PTC and offering to one of our customers,
we probably achieve between 30% and 40% incremental margins there. So in line with overall company
average, lower, of course, than if it would be our own controls or our own software.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Patrick, congrats. Steve, looking forward to working with you again.

Steven Etzel

Thank you, Andy.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Blake, I know you spoke about this a bit in your prepared remarks, but can you give us a little more color
into what you're seeing in terms of your customers, either reshoring or investing to avoid single points of
failure? We know you've talked about in the past, life sciences, semiconductors. Are you seeing investment
continuing to increase in these sectors or actually increasing outside of these sectors? And when you think
about the order uptick you've seen, would you characterize a significant amount of orders as related to
this type of investment?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. As we've talked about before, Andy, life sciences is probably the area where we have the longest
list of customers that have announced plans to do things in the U.S. Some of these have been public
about what they're doing. You think about what Becton Dickinson is doing or Sanofi and so on. And other
customers that we're working with, but they haven't yet disclosed that publicly, and so we respect that.
We've also seen some high-profile semiconductor announcements. We've talked in the past about Taiwan

semi and the work that we're doing with them. And there's some others out there in other industries,
consumer electronics, consumer tools.

I'd say it's a steady cadence. And we have let's say, get-started kits, if you will, to work with customers
who are considering doing these sorts of things that our salespeople are familiar with. It's really a part
of the overall attempts for resilience. So we're not seeing an avalanche of that reshoring. We see it as
steady. But the business that's coming out of it, it's meaningful. It's certainly in the millions of dollars that
we're seeing there.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And then can you give us more color into what you're seeing in the automotive markets? You mentioned
it was better than you expected, but down 20% in Q4, as you know, was only modestly better than Q3's
decline and a lot of builds did improve materially globally. So we know you're guiding on automotive being
up 10% in FY '21. Was there anything that kind of held you back in Q4 versus builds? And maybe update
us on sort of the EV transition we're seeing. It seems to be accelerating a bit. That should help you, I
think, as you go into '21.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. We did see, as with almost all our industries, good sequentially. It was strong a double-digit
sequential increase in automotive, right, so up 20% gives us optimism. And as we talk about fiscal year
'21, getting to around 10% growth in automotive that we think we have a line of sight on the projects and
the improving MRO to substantiate that. And obviously, within there, areas like electric vehicle that we
think are particularly good for us as we see higher win rates in EV than across the general portfolio for
automotive.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So Patrick, congratulations. And Steve, look forward to working with you again, as everybody has
mentioned, yes.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Andrew.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So maybe Patrick, I'll ask you a question about Mexican FX, if my -- no, I won't do that. Just a couple
of questions. So first, you also announced -- in addition to PTC partnership, you also announced the
expansion of your partnership with Microsoft. And I was just wondering because Microsoft is aligned with
PTC, but yet they're trying to do their own thing in industrial vertical. Can you just talk a little bit more
what it is you're doing more with Microsoft? Because clearly, you guys have been aligned for a long time.
But is there anything new there? Is there more focus on SaaS, more focus on cloud? So that's my first
question.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. The primary focus of this new expansion of work with Microsoft is targeted at Azure infrastructure
and the cloud. And so we're working with Microsoft, and we'll be demonstrating some of our new
capabilities that are already well along in the areas of design as well as information and using a SaaS

17

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

approach for new capabilities. So these really complement our existing capabilities and are kind of a
forerunner of a significant amount of new functionality, both on-prem and in the cloud that customers will
see over the next year or so.

So it's really -- it's focused on combining forces, using their expertise with Azure and our OT expertise to
provide new design tools for customers, and we're very excited about it. I'm excited not only about the
functionality, the specific functionality that's going to bring, but it's the pace with which we were able to
join forces, assemble teams and to come together to create new value from the first meeting, really, that
we talked about this with Microsoft to now, it's been less than a year. And that's a great foreshadowing of
things to come.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And do you need to reconfigure your sales force or add sales to sort of do more of these SaaS Azure
sales?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

It's -- we're certainly going to be adding additional talent and learning new motions within our sales
force. But it's really a microcosm of the overall convergence of IT and OT. Our home field advantages,
our understanding of these customers and operational technologies and what happens on the plant floor
and how they make money or avoid downtime and complementing that with perspectives of people who
understand the software selling motion is what we're right in the middle of now. We're making significant
investments in new talent, training, enablement for our overall sales force, and so it's bringing the talent
up together, the existing plus the new.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And just a follow-up question. With the new administration, frankly, we're hearing from a lot of investors
that new administration maybe means less focus on reshoring because tariffs will go away. What kind of
conversations have you had with your customers about sort of contingency plans and their longer-term
strategy on capacity in the U.S. and globally in light of the election results?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

We're encouraged in that the Biden campaign and the Biden administration's talked about the importance
of U.S. manufacturing, and so that is the single most important issue for us. And we're optimistic that
they recognize the importance that manufacturing in this country plays as a part of the vital core of the
American economy. And so we're looking forward to working with them through professional organizations
and so on to find ways to increase the manufacturing in the U.S., along with the attendant issue of
workforce development, which is a crucial issue for us as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

So just want to go back to John's question on sequential sales. Did you say 1Q up 5%? I'm not sure if that
was what you indicated. Just normally, 1Q is below 4Q. So I just want to make sure I got that right.

Steven Etzel

Yes. So we are seeing some momentum, as I described in the product side, but it's typical for Q1 for
solutions to be down. So my general comment was roughly mid-single-digit sequential growth. It could be
a little slower than that in Q1, and that's part of the reason why we mentioned that Q1 EPS could be down

ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 10, 2020

sequentially -- expected to be down sequentially from Q4 there as well as the sequential headwind from
the temporary actions being reversed and bonus being reinstated.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Right. But the point is, that there's enough momentum in products that could offset the seasonal downtick
in solutions.

Steven Etzel

Yes. I think directionally, that's probably the case.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then the expansion of the relationship with PTC, one of your big
competitors has taken a very strong view on the PLM-PLC integration, and I think historically, Rockwell has
been a bit more skeptical about that. I'm just wondering, has there been a change in your view of sort of
the integration amongst those layers? And then sort of within that, have you done all of the investment
required to offer an integrated solution with PTC? Or there's still from investment spending to be done
around that?

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Our view is that a customer is going to have multiple applications to create their version of the
digital thread, and that's going to vary by different industries. So what you're looking for in terms of the
digital thread and oil and gas is going to be different than what you're looking for in automotive typically.
That said, we are selectively looking at integration between interesting parts of the PTC portfolio. One
of the specific areas that Jim Heppelmann highlighted during Liveworks this past summer was Onshape
and our Emulate3D simulation capabilities. And so that's one area that's very interesting, and we have
differentiated value. We're using it in our own facilities, and it's helped us win competitively in other areas.

But that doesn't mean that we have to have that capability in every instance in-house, an open approach
and respecting the investment that customers already have made in terms of training and installation,
different vendors. Application software in industry is an important tenet of our approach to the market.
And so we don't necessarily need to own everything. But when we pick particularly interesting use cases,
like the one I just mentioned between Onshape and Emulate3D, that's an example where we will go
deeper, and we will provide additional integration tools to add that value.

Operator

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Jessica Kourakos for
closing remarks.

Jessica Kourakos
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you. Thank you, Amy. I'll turn it back to Blake for a few final comments.

Blake D. Moret
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Jessica. Nobody is better positioned than Rockwell and our partners to bring information
technology and industrial operational technology together. We remain focused on the well-being of our
employees, and we continue to manage thoughtfully through a gradual recovery. At the same time, we're
happy to see the positive results of steps being taken to accelerate profitable growth.

I also want to wish Patrick all the best. Patrick, you played a big role in our success, and you'll be missed.
