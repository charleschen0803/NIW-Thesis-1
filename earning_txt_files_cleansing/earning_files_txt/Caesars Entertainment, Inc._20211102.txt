Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment, Inc. 2021
Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to your moderator today, Brian Agnew, Senior Vice President of
Finance, Treasury and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.

Brian Matthew Agnew
Senior Vice President of Finance, Treasury & Investor Relations

Thank you, Ren, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss
our third quarter 2021 earnings. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial
results for the period ended September 30, 2021. A copy of the press release is available on the Investor
Relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com. As usual, joining me on the call today are Tom
Reeg, our Chief Executive Officer; Anthony Carano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bret
Yunker, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before I turn the call over to Anthony, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call,
we may make certain forward-looking statements about the company's performance. Such forward-
looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, one should not place undue
reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. For additional information
concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in our forward-looking
statements, you should refer to the cautionary statements contained in our press release as well as the
risk factors contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Caesars
Entertainment undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect
events or circumstances that occur after today's call.

Also, during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by
SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial
measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and
the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at investor.caesars.com
by selecting the press release regarding the company's 2021 third quarter financial results.

I will now turn the call over to Anthony.

Anthony L. Carano
President & COO

Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. The third quarter of '21 was another strong
quarter. We delivered $1.04 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, excluding Caesars Digital, which
represented a quarterly record for our brick-and-mortar properties. 31 of our 51 properties set a record
for the highest third quarter EBITDA, while 32 set a record for the highest Q3 EBITDA margin.

Starting with Las Vegas. Demand trends remained exceptionally strong through the quarter, leading to
an all-time quarterly record of $500 million in adjusted EBITDA in our Las Vegas segment. Excluding real
rent payments, EBITDA improved 44% versus the third quarter of 2019, and margins improved 1,400
basis points to 50%. Total occupancy for Q3 was 89%, with weekend occupancy at 97% and midweek
occupancy 86%.

Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends into 2022 and beyond. While group attrition
remains higher than normal, we began to see conventions return to Las Vegas in the third quarter, and the
segment represented approximately 10% of occupied room nights, a dramatic improvement versus the
first half of '21. We continue to expect to see a gradual recovery in the segment leading into next year,

and we are encouraged as group and convention revenues on the books for '22 continue to pace nicely
ahead of '19.

Demand for the CAESARS FORUM is exceeding the original underwriting expectations, with over 175
events booked currently, representing 1.8 million room nights and over $650 million of revenues for all
future periods. 76% of this business is new to Caesars.

Turning to our regional markets. Operating results remained strong, especially in markets not impacted by
severe natural disaster events. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding New Orleans, Lake Tahoe and Lake Charles,
increased 35% versus 2019, with margins improving by 860 bps to 38%. On a same-store sales basis, we
achieved the highest third quarter EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the regional segment in the history of
the company.

In our Caesars Digital segment, we generated over $3 billion of volume, $96 million of net revenue and
an adjusted EBITDA loss of $164 million. Sports betting and iCasino handle was split roughly 55-45. 90%
of our handle was from mobile sports betting and iCasino. We are laser focused on scaling our digital
business through aggressive customer acquisition during our first fall sports season post launch of our
Caesars branded apps in 9 states.

While customer acquisition and handle exceeded our internal expectations, net revenues were negatively
impacted by directed promotional investment in odds and profit boost, competitive pricing strategies and
lower-than-historical hold in certain markets. We are pleased that our sports betting handle share in the 8
states operating on Liberty platform has increased to 12% through September. Arizona has not reported
and is therefore not included in these stats.

Our national market share through September, including all legalized sports betting states sits at 17%.
Following the exciting launch of retail sports betting in Louisiana on Sunday, we now offer sports betting
in 20 jurisdictions, 14 of which are mobile. Importantly, we expect to complete the migration of our legacy
apps in Washington, D.C., Nevada, Pennsylvania and Illinois to our Liberty platform in 2022.

We are also excited to be rolling out enhanced iCasino offerings in the fourth quarter following anticipated
regulatory approvals related to the release of new games in New Jersey, Michigan and West Virginia.
Our expanded game portfolio will be accompanied by significant improvements to our in-app marketing
technologies.

On the development front, we are making great progress on our new land-based facility in Lake Charles.
This significantly upgraded property should be completed and ready for business in the fourth quarter of
'22. In New Orleans, construction work has started on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las
Vegas, the remodeling of the entrance to Caesars Palace is making great progress, and we look forward to
a dramatically improved arrival experience sometime in Q1 of '22.

In Indiana, we are well underway with our casino expansion in Indiana Grand, which should be finished
by January of '22. And finally, in Atlantic City, our $400 million capital plan is actively moving forward
with remodeling room towers and setting the stage for exciting new food and beverage and entertainment
options.

As we look to 2022, we see several tailwinds in our business, and we remain optimistic about further
visitation gains as consumers return to our property once COVID fears have fully subsided. We remain
confident in the eventual return of the convention customer to Las Vegas and our destination markets.

Lastly, we are excited to rebrand a handful of our properties in 2022 using flagship brands from the
Caesars portfolio to even further elevate the customer experience. I am extremely proud of our operating
teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service during this third quarter.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the quarter.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

Thanks, Anthony, and good afternoon, everybody. We pre-released for our bond deal earlier in the quarter.
So you had 2 months of brick-and-mortar operations effectively. So I'm going to be lighter on comments
on brick-and-mortar and go a little deeper into Digital.

On the brick-and-mortar side, if Ida didn't hit New Orleans and we didn't have the Caldor Fire in Tahoe,
we would have done $1.1 billion of brick-and-mortar EBITDA in the quarter. We had an extremely strong
quarter. Demand remains particularly robust.

In regards to New Orleans and Tahoe, Tahoe has pretty quickly recovered back to above 2019 levels, not
quite as strong as it was pre-fire but continuing to build. In New Orleans, recall that we have significant
operating leverage there that works in both directions. You've got a minimum guaranteed tax payment to
the state and the city in Louisiana. So New Orleans EBITDA continues to trail '19, although it is continuing
to recover as well. Going into the storm, we were doing $11 million, $12 million a month in EBITDA out of
New Orleans, and now we're more like $5 million or $6 million and building.

Vegas had a record quarter, beating the record of the second quarter. So $424 million went to $500 million
of EBITDA, $511 million, adding back the real rent payment. As Anthony said, we were 50% margin again.
That was in spite of us imposing occupancy caps midweek so that we could calibrate the supply with our
housekeeping services. We are struggling across the country to hire guest room attendance. Vegas is no
exception.

So even with the operating caps, we set a quarterly EBITDA record. In October, Vegas had the strongest
EBITDA month in the history of Caesars. So the strength has continued into October, regionals as well.
We're still pacing up in the neighborhood of 40% over '19.

So feel very good about the setup going into '22. Customer demand remains strong. Obviously, the virus
numbers have subsided considerably over the past 6 to 8 weeks, and we're seeing some pickup in demand
as that rolls through.

For Digital, I spoke to Digital in the second quarter call in terms of what you should expect from us. As
I said, we anticipated investing in terms of cumulative EBITDA losses north of $1 billion into the Digital
segment and generating cash-on-cash EBITDA returns at maturity north of 50%. And what we saw in
terms of opportunity for us was the ability to activate our 50-plus properties, our 50,000-plus employees
and, most importantly, our 65 million strong Caesars Rewards database. And that's what we set out to do.

So as I go through these numbers, I'm going to talk about how I look at this business in terms of
measuring what we're doing versus expectations. I would -- even though we're extremely encouraged that
the numbers that I'm going to be talking about are ahead of our internal expectations as we launch this,
it's very early, and this is a long game. So we expect it to not be a straight line.

But what we anticipated was in states where we offered our Liberty technology, where we were starting on
equal footing and where we had existing strong database, that those would be our most effective markets.
And that describes Arizona to a T, which launched during the quarter, has not published results yet, but
we think that the results will show us in excess of the handle number -- percentage numbers that Anthony
described earlier.

In the Liberty states in total -- and I'm looking at handle because in the current customer acquisition
environment, hold is volatile not just because of the results of the sporting events but because of the
boost and the promotions that you offer. So when I talk about share, I'm talking about handle share. So
in our Liberty states, handle share has almost doubled since launch. That's in the 6s to about 12% mobile
market share. That's without Arizona. As I said, I'd expect that to exceed the average and bring it higher.

Arizona is our second -- our third strongest state behind Nevada and Iowa, where we have incumbent
advantages, and that reflects exactly what we expected. States where we launched but we were late to
the game but did have Liberty, we're seeing continued build in market share on the order of 200 to 500
basis points depending on the market since we launched.

Importantly, if you're looking at analysis that looks at market share across the entire U.S. market, realize
that we are not competing for the time being in Pennsylvania and Illinois, which are 2 of the biggest

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

markets out there. When we launched, the Liberty platform was not approved in either state. It will
be approved in the first half of 2022 is our expectation. But we didn't want to spend money guiding
customers to an experience that would not be what we wanted to offer them. And so you see our share in
those markets sucks for lack of a better term.

If you look at where our customers are coming from, when you're spending like we're spending on
advertising and promotion, you're going to get lots and lots of customers that show up at your door. A lot
of them are not going to be worth a lot of value. If you look at our customer by count, Caesars Rewards
customers are somewhere around 1/3 of our total new deposits since we relaunched. By handle, Caesars
Rewards customers are about half of our handle since relaunch. So validating that we think Caesars built
a system over 2 decades that identified the valuable customers that everyone is out there searching for.
We're seeing that in our experience, and that's extremely encouraging as we look to the future.

The performance in Arizona, also encouraging as we look to states like Louisiana, which just launched
retail on Sunday. We'll launch mobile in the near future. Maryland will come online soon as well. These are
states where we're in a similar position to where we were in Arizona, so we'd expect to perform well.

When we show -- when we give you our 17% total market share, that's everything. That's the states we're
not doing well in like Pennsylvania and Illinois that are not Liberty states, but also includes Nevada, which
is not a Liberty state where we have tremendous market share. We're not adding fantasy numbers in
there. We're not adding a horse racing business in there. We're showing you pure sports betting handle.
And if you think about what we did in sports in the quarter, our handle for the third quarter was a little
under $1.7 billion -- I'm sorry, a little over $1.7 billion for the full quarter. In October alone, we did over
$1.3 billion of handle. So we think we're continuing to generate momentum.

And when I talk about the return on investment, obviously, we had a model that showed where we
expected to get in market share and the pace at which we expected to get there. So you can see from the
EBITDA loss that it's relatively in line with what we were telling people to expect, but our ramp in market
share has exceeded our expectations in terms of its pace.

Now the question to that is, does that mean there's a broader market -- bigger market share number
down the road? And the candid answer is we don't know right now. But what we do know is we're gaining
share at a pace stronger than we expected given the investment that we've made. So encouraging results
from sports.

In iCasino, if you want to think about somewhere where we have tracked a little bit below plan, we
inherited a platform in iCasino that was noncompetitive from a game offering standpoint. And so again,
we've not spent money advertising and promoting our iCasino business until we get the approvals we need
to offer a broader array of games that's competitive with our peers that are out there. We expect that will
take place before the end of this year. And so then we can talk with, frankly, more relevance as to what's
happening in iCasino. We continue to perform strongly in New Jersey in iCasino, but we have not pushed a
launch in iCasino beyond New Jersey today.

So in summary, we're extremely encouraged, both brick-and-mortar -- and one thing I should say about
wrapping this Digital business into the physical enterprise, the employees that have leaned just done an
outstanding job of leaning into this launch for us and Caesars Rewards activating the database, this is not
something where you just flip a switch. This is going to continue to build momentum as the quarters pile
up. We -- I think we've done a good job of getting our message out there, getting our brand out there,
and we're encouraged to see the customers respond.

And with that, I'll flip to Bret.

Bret Yunker
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Tom. We had an active third quarter of M&A and capital markets activity. On September 9, we
announced an agreement to sell the non-U.S. assets of William Hill to 888 Holdings for GBP 2.2 billion.
Following repayment of debt, we will receive net proceeds of approximately USD 1.2 billion. We expect this
transaction will close during the first quarter of 2022.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

On September 10, we priced $1.2 billion of new unsecured notes at a 4 5/8% coupon. And we repriced
$1.8 billion of CRC term loan B at LIBOR plus 350, a decrease of 100 bps. Proceeds from the new notes
alongside $500 million of cash on hand were used to fully retire $1.7 billion of existing CRC notes.

In late September and October, we continued to use excess cash on hand to permanently repay debt
through $100 million of open market purchases of our existing 8 1/8% notes. Aggregate year-to-date debt
reduction is approaching $1 billion, which has resulted in approximately $75 million of annualized interest
expense savings.

Net proceeds from the sale of William Hill's non-U.S. business will be applied to debt reduction in the first
half of 2022, yielding further interest expense savings and enhance free cash flow. Our 2021 calendar year
CapEx spend, excluding Atlantic City, is now $350 million to $400 million, which includes approximately
$75 million for Caesars Digital. This is simply a shift in timing of planned CapEx from 2021 to 2022, driven
in part by the hurricane that impacted our New Orleans expansion and COVID-related supply shortage.

With that, I'll turn it back to Tom.

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Thanks, Bret. And to talk a little bit about '22, when we closed the Caesars transaction, obviously, we
closed into an uncertain environment with a highly leveraged capital structure. And we needed to bridge to
the point where we'd be generating a lot of free cash flow to pay down that debt.

You heard Bret talk about the beginnings of that in '21. '22 is going to be a massive cash flow generation
-- cash generation and deployment year for the company. As Bret said, we've got the William Hill asset
sale settling. Between the William Hill non-U.S. business, the NeoGames sale, we've got about $1.5 billion
of proceeds to deploy, the bulk of which will be coming in '22. We're generating in the brick-and-mortar
business something in the neighborhood of $2 billion a year of free cash flow right now. And so if you're
looking from now until -- from end of third quarter to end of '22, you're well over $2 billion of cash there.

We also think this is an opportune time to execute on our strategy of a strip asset sale. So you should
expect us to put that in motion in the early part of '22. And if you look at all of -- and as Bret said, you
should expect us to be aggressive on the refinancing front in '22 as well, which should dramatically lower
our cost of debt.

And so if you add all of those up, we should have well in excess of $5 billion of cash to deploy in '22. Some
of that will be spent in the Digital business. Some of that will be spent on capital projects that drive ROI
in the portfolio. But the vast majority of that cash is going to go to pay down debt, where we can be in a
position to be pushing almost half of our conventional debt off the balance sheet and ultimately reducing
our cash interest expense by the end of '22 to $300 million or $400 million a year less than it was when
we closed the transaction.

So we are extraordinarily excited for what's to come in '22. Happy -- very happy with the results that
we're reporting to you today. And happy to answer any questions that you have.
Operator, can we open the line for questions?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from DB.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Tom, and I know it hasn't been a long time since you kind of started, but given the few months of
the ramp and relative to your expectations on the sports side and keeping aside the iCasino aside for
a second, when do you believe you could start to see that business turn positive in terms of EBITDA
contribution? Is it as soon as 2023? Or are we looking kind of beyond that and out into '24, '25?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

I'm expecting football season of '23, Carlo.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then you talked a little bit about the Las Vegas sale. And clearly, the comps have been --
your patience has seemingly paid off with what you've seen in terms of comps. Is there anything special
about the first half of next year that -- or early next year that you guys will get aggressive in terms of
looking to make that transaction happen?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

No. It's really a matter of, as we discussed, we wanted to be marketing off an EBITDA number that we're
generating from the property, not trying to bridge to some number that we've not done before. So now
we've got a track record that we can point to in terms of what the property can generate. And the deck
is -- the playing field has kind of been cleared with the Cosmo and ARIA trades to where we should have
a pretty robust -- we should encounter pretty robust demand for a center strip asset that frankly may be
one of the last ones to trade for quite some time.

Carlo Santarelli
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. And then if I could, Tom, just one follow-up as it pertains to kind of Las Vegas trends from 2Q to 3Q
more or less. Clearly, business volumes are higher. Revenues were up nicely sequentially. OpEx was also
up. Do you guys kind of think the current OpEx run rate is something that's sustainable on these business
volumes? Or -- I know you talked about staffing and keeping occupancy kind of in check during midweek
to adjust to labor levels. But is kind of the current OpEx environment that you had in the 3Q in Las Vegas
specifically, is that a place where you think you can kind of maintain going forward?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

I do. But frankly, I'd like to see OpEx come up some as we fill our particularly guest room attendant
positions so that we can unlock the caps on the midweek, and I'd expect that to happen at some point in
'22.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

Tom, maybe we can dovetail into what Carlo was talking about sort of on the sustainability of margins.
Was there a big difference between the margin exit rate in Las Vegas and the regional versus, what, say,
going into the beginning of the 3Q, excluding weather-impacted areas?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Can you -- margin -- what...

Brian Matthew Agnew
Senior Vice President of Finance, Treasury & Investor Relations

Margin exit rate.

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

No. I mean we were pretty stable throughout the quarter, Joe, and into October. We're still running 40%
consolidated EBITDA margins.

Joseph Richard Greff
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then you mentioned by the end of this year, you would have a larger quantum of
competitive iCasino games launched, which you've talked about before. Can you talk about what you
sort of think the incremental investment is in that part of the $1 billion of cumulative losses and how you
think of that as you move sequentially from September and October to the end of the year in Digital more
broadly in terms of what that incremental investment might be?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

So that was built into the guidance -- the framework I gave for build of the entire business, as you know,
to the extent those are -- the bulk of those are third-party games, their participation from a revenue
standpoint. So that was all built in. It's just a question of timing of getting them through the approvals in
the various states.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.

Steven Moyer Wieczynski
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So Tom, you called out that the $1 billion investment or spend level on Digital on your last call and that
would last, let's say, 8 to 10 quarters. I think that's what you talked about. I guess the question is with
what you've seen so far in the progress you've made with market share, are you still comfortable with that
all-in investment? And will that be sufficient? Or I guess another way I could ask that is, let's say, 2 years
down the road, your market share doesn't pan out where you think it's going to be, could that $1 billion
investment eventually turn into a much higher number? Or at this point, you just don't see that being the
case?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

No. I'd say it's the opposite of what you described, Steve. It's -- post launch, the bulk of our spending now
is success-based. It's tied to customer acquisition. So if we do worse than we're expecting from a share
perspective, I'd expect that the ultimate investment will be less. If we do better than we expected from a
share perspective, I'd expect the ultimate investment to be more, but obviously, the return will fall in both
directions.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Understood. And then second question. I think Tom, you called out a $5 billion number of cash to
deploy next year, and that assumes a Vegas asset sale. I guess the question there is you've talked about
potentially letting go more than one asset in Las Vegas, and at this point, is that still the case? Or is it kind
of one in '22 and then go from there? Or is there the possibility that you could eventually do more than
one in '22?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Well, with the caveat that as a public company, every asset is for sale every day. There's some confusion.
There were 2 ROFRs in the VICI agreements at the close. We have never said we expect to sell a second
property nor do we expect to -- at this point, we'd expect to sell a single property and be done. But we'll
assess where we are in the market, what our balance sheet looks like afterward and how we feel about
our future prospects. But I think it will be limited to one asset. And also, just to go back to -- when I talk
about deploying capital in '22, I think it's going to be well in excess of $5 billion, not $5 million on the
notes.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I think I heard correctly that you said you did over $1.7 billion of sports betting handle in the third quarter
and then over $1.3 billion of handle in October, which, based on my numbers, implied you've had about
15% U.S. market share in September -- sorry, in the third quarter and then close to 20% in October. Can
you just parse out a little bit? You relaunched your sportsbook August 2. So like how was the trajectory in
the third quarter? And then any color of Nevada versus the rest of the space just to kind of give a view on
kind of what the legacy business did versus the newer businesses?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes. So the -- in terms of handle, as you would expect, the quarter built, August was considerably bigger
than July and September dwarfed August because the calendar October is considerably more than
September. In terms of the states, I've talked about the Liberty states. We went from -- in the 6s to about
12 in terms of handle market share as we're measuring it. In total, we're about 17%. Nevada share was
flat over that time frame. We obviously have very large share in Nevada but didn't have any significant
move in share. Keep in mind, Nevada is not a Liberty state yet either.

Thomas Glassbrooke Allen
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And then just as my follow-up, can you just talk a little bit -- I mean you gave some color around what's
been going well in the cross-sell with the Caesars Rewards customers. But can you talk about some of the
other things, your $5,000 risk-free bet, the commercials, all of that? Like how do you think they're doing?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

It's hard to parse all of that. From a commercial standpoint, they measure unaided brand awareness,
and that's through the roof since we started. The commercials basically ask a question of list sports -- list
companies that you know offer sportsbooks. The amount of people -- percentage of people that would
name Caesars today is dramatically higher than it was on August 1.

The individual promotions, we're constantly tweaking those. I don't really want to, for competitive
reasons, get into what's worked the best and what hasn't worked. But you should expect to see that

continue. We've rolled out single-game parlays, which in NFL action is -- has been growing substantially as
a percentage of our bets. And that's very high hold business, so that's good to see.

Bret Yunker
Chief Financial Officer

And the app, and I'm sure you track this, Tom, has seen a significant improvement on the sports category
rank on iOS. I mean we were trailing -- we were roughly 150 ranked and now we're making great progress
between 15 and 20 on the iOS apps. So just a tremendous improvement there.

Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas from Truist.

Barry Jonathan Jonas
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

How are you thinking about ROI in Digital markets with higher tax rates like New York?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Obviously, that's going to influence your reinvestment rate. You're looking for ultimately what's my
return on capital. But you can -- in the larger population states, high velocity, high participation, you can
conceivably make money at higher tax rates than in lower-volume states. But obviously, we prefer the
lower tax jurisdictions as an operator.

Barry Jonathan Jonas
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And once you reach a point when you compare back promos for Digital, how do you think about
the size and profitability of any business lost? And I guess with that, any updated thoughts on a mature
market share goal?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

We've not been out there with a market share goal and don't want to start that today other than to
make the point again that the target that we had in mind when we put out the metrics last quarter, we're
gaining share much, much quicker than we anticipated as we started out. What was the other piece of
that?

Barry Jonathan Jonas
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

The question was when you reach a point you can start paring back promos, how do you think about what
business stays and what remains? Sorry, what...

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

So we can -- as we -- as you -- if you deposit in our app, you're signing up for Caesars Rewards, in the
vast majority of cases, if you're not already a customer. So we're bringing new customers into the system.
Our expectation is -- our history has been that customer becomes sticky to the brand over time as they
realize the benefits of what the rewards program brings them.

So we're looking at it from the standpoint of we think -- if you're thinking of lifetime value of a customer,
we think our lifetime value of a customer is going to compare favorably with our peers both because of the
profile of the average Caesars Reward customer that is starting to dominate our handle and the length of
time that they're going to stick with the app because of the relationship with the rewards program. But we
do know that we're going to lose some of these guys that are shopping from site to site for what's the best
promo I can get tonight.

Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

Tom, just thinking about like the ramp-up in some of, let's call it, the non-fair fight states where you were
a little bit later. Can you just talk maybe at a higher level? I think you tried to give us some direction in a
couple of different ways. But can you just talk a little bit about how you expect us to be able to monitor
what you guys expect to see about the ramp-up in some of those really competitive existing states, the
New Jerseys, the Pennsylvanias, the Michigans of the world? Just how should those trend as we see that
data coming in every month? And what KPI are you looking for to kind of continue to show success in
those markets?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

I mean we're looking at handle share for the time being. And if you want -- Michigan went from 3 to
over 6. Tennessee went from 2 to almost 8. Virginia went from 6 to 10. So you're seeing it in the states
where we jumped in late that we're gaining share materially early on and expect that -- we'd expect to
continue to claw share over time. So there's really no state I can point to where I'd say we haven't seen
the experience since launch that we're building share from where we were. It's just in the case of the
states we talked about where we're late, we're starting from a low base and the claw is going to take more
time.

Shaun Clisby Kelley
BofA Securities, Research Division

And my follow-up would be a little bit on the cost side. So you've obviously been very visible with the kind
of national ad buy, but there's been some discussion already that there's been some pullback in the big TV
buys. And you've also talked about your performance marketing a little bit. So can you just talk -- I mean
I'm sure you've got your own competitive plan out there. But how do you think about maybe switching
some of that spend through channels as your awareness reaches a level that everybody is going to know
you're out there and you really start to focus on effectiveness? Is there a right time line to think about for
that? Or what kind of -- how have you thought about those buckets evolving over time?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

You should expect through this football season, we're going to continue to be aggressive. We just filmed
another around of what we're calling season 2 of ads that will start rolling out this month. So we're going
to be all over the place in terms of media. Where we have -- where we've kept our powder dry is the
media that was targeted toward iCasino until we get the product up to the standard that we want.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo.

Daniel Brian Politzer
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So Tom, you mentioned this a little bit in terms of the new sign-ups from the Caesar Rewards. I mean can
you maybe quantify that or put some numbers there? And have you seen these -- to what extent have you
seen the sign-ups -- the new players flow into your properties and create more of an omnichannel benefit?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

As I said -- the answer to the first question is no, I'm not going to put raw data on those numbers but
figure Caesars Rewards first-time depositors have been 1/4 to 1/3 of our first-time deposits but as far as

handle have been about half. Those are kind of broad -- those are broadly where we're at. And as I said,
as you sign up for the app and deposit, you're prompted to sign up for Caesars Rewards. And we're seeing
an extremely high uptake in terms of people signing up for Caesars Rewards, and we're seeing cross-
visitation.

One of the areas where we're particularly active is the high end of the market, large betters that are new
to our system, where we're willing to take large sports bets. And we're seeing those customers make their
way into our high-limit rooms as well. So that's been an encouraging sign. And we've seen that all the way
down to the low levels of the database as well.

Daniel Brian Politzer
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just for my follow-up, I think for William Hill and Nevada, I think it's historically had
around 30% or so market share for sports betting. I mean since you guys took full ownership, have you
seen any changes in terms of your partners there? I know online has certainly grown a lot as well.

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

We're about half of Nevada.

Your next question comes from the line of David Katz from Jefferies.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

I wanted to go back to the commentary you've gone over a little bit on iGaming with the offering not being
up to what your standard is. And I think early on, you indicated the breadth of games was not what you
wanted. From a technology and game engine perspective, are those elements that you're still working on?
Or is it really just a content offering issue primarily?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

We're never stopping work on the nuts and bolts behind both OSB and iGaming, but the iGaming piece
that we're waiting on is virtually entirely content at this point. And it's just a matter of getting through
the bureaucracy in each state in terms of getting the games approved on our apps. And this is a function
of -- this is not states dragging their feet. William Hill in its former life as a U.K.-domiciled and managed
company didn't provide the resources to the U.S. business to develop both the OSB platform and the
iGaming platform to their fullest extent. And so what we're doing is providing the resources and ability to
let iGaming catch up with OSB.

David Brian Katz
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Understood. And with respect to iGaming, there is, I believe, a conventional wisdom that with fewer states
and perhaps smaller share or smaller total handle, the profitability and the LTVs of those customers, et
cetera, can be equivalent or even better than OSB. Is that what your expectation is as we start to get
some of those handle numbers and see some of those share numbers from you?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes. We are -- iGaming is and has been a material profit generator in New Jersey for us. And we would
expect Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, as we roll out, to follow that same path.

And one last one, if I may, which is within sports betting and iGaming, the appearance is that you have
a fully integrated control over that enterprise. Is that correct? Or are there B2B participants in there that
may be driving certain aspects of your sports betting enterprise?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

The only piece is the PAM that's provided by NeoGames, but that's a unique arrangement given our
ownership interest in NeoGames, where we have a dedicated team that works on only the Caesars PAM at
NeoGames.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie.

Chad C. Beynon
Macquarie Research

I'll add on to the Digital questions. Just one on Canada, specifically Ontario. I know the marketing will be a
little bit different up there versus what we're seeing in the United States. Can you give us a sense of how
you think the market will shake out? And any commentary around your rewards program membership up
there just given that the customer acquisition will be different than what we're seeing state side?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes. So we're watching as you are as they go through the mechanics of how it will roll out. We anticipate
that we will be among the better-positioned operators in Ontario given our long management contract
history with Caesars Windsor. So we have a large amount of Ontario customers available to us and known
to us through Caesars Rewards.

Chad C. Beynon
Macquarie Research

Okay. And Tom, I'm not sure if you or Anthony mentioned this in your prepared remarks. But on the
regional markets, I know a lot of the recovery has been driven by spend per visit versus visitation.
Visitation has certainly been a laggard. Can you help us think about if visitation has -- if the recovery has
plateaued or if you're still seeing that improve as that 55 and older customer gets comfortable coming
back to your properties?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

Yes. I'd say the story has remained the same, that spend per visit continues to be elevated. And I'd expect
that to remain the case as long as the U.S. savings rate is about 2x what it's been historically. We do
expect if and when you get a full retreat of COVID, on the retail side, we do expect that there's significant
portions of the database, significant portion of the population that will then be willing to come to the
casinos that are not coming today. We also expect that as business travel returns, we'd expect there to be
a similar experience of pent-up demand for business travel once we've got this behind us.

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

These are kind of follow-ups to some of the Digital questions earlier. I guess as you launch iGaming, how
are you thinking about who that customer is and how to ensure it's truly incremental revenues and profits
versus kind of cannibalizing the base?

CEO & Director

Yes. Steve, we've got a lot of experience there in New Jersey that's going to be relevant to us in other
states. If you think about the states we're going to be rolling out in, we don't have a property in Michigan.
We have a single property that's not large in Pennsylvania, and we don't have a property in West Virginia.
So we don't expect that to be a material factor for us in those states.

Stephen White Grambling
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And maybe another follow-up. I know that you gave a little bit of detail about people
spending on device and then in property. Is there anything else that you can kind of provide in terms
of thinking about how we -- there in terms of greater time on device or step-up in frequency of bets as
you've been launching?

Thomas Robert Reeg
CEO & Director

It's awfully early to be stating anything definitively in terms of that type of behavior considering we've
really been alive for 60 days here. What I would say is things like Digital customers of value being invited
to brick-and-mortar properties, we're doing a lot of that. And the response has been overwhelming. That
doesn't happen in apps of our peers.

So we think -- and this is -- as I said earlier, this isn't you just flip a switch. This is you've got to activate
this. You get better at it every day, and momentum builds. But some of the stuff that we're seeing that's
small and kind of neat right now is going to be significant drivers of value going forward.

Anybody else, operator?
