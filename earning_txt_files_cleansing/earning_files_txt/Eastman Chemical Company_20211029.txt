EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2021 Eastman Chemical conference call.
Today's conference is being recorded. This call is being broadcast live on the Eastman's website,
www.eastman.com. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Riddle of Eastman Chemical Company,
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Gregory A. Riddle
Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications

Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are
Mark Costa, Board, Chair and CEO; William McLain, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jake LaRoe,
Manager, Investor Relations.

Yesterday after market closed, we posted our third quarter 2021 financial results news release and SEC
8-K filing, as well as our slides and the related prepared remarks in the Investors section of our website,
www.eastman.com.

Now before we begin, I'll cover two items. First, during this presentation, you will hear certain forward-
looking statements concerning our plans and expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially.
Certain factors related to future expectations are or will be detailed in our third quarter 2021 financial
results news release, during this call, in the preceding slides and prepared remarks and in our filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-Q filed for second quarter 2021 and the
Form 10-Q to be filed for third quarter 2021.

Second, earnings referenced in this presentation exclude certain noncore and unusual items.
Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures,
including a description of the excluded and adjusted items, are available in the third quarter 2021 financial
results news release.
As we posted the slides and accompanying prepared remarks on our website last night, we will now go
straight into Q&A. Mary, please let's start with our first question.

Question and Answer

Operator

We'll now take our first question from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And thank you for the updated outlook on 2022. And to that effect, if I could just ask you, Mark, what are
you assuming for auto production in 2022 versus 2021?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

And what we're assuming is that the auto production situation remains pretty challenged as it has been
in the back half of this year as we go into next year. But things get sort of modestly better through the
year, especially in the back half, but there's no sort of heroic assumptions about auto recovery next year
versus this year in the forecast. So depending on everyone's view, you can adjust up or down relative to
that assumption.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And if we just look at the third quarter, can you sort of help us bridge sort of how the specialty
portfolio volume would have performed if you ex out the impact from auto? So what the other businesses
are doing on an underlying rate?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Go ahead, Willie.

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, Vincent. What I would highlight, first of all, is, again, we have mix included in that for the quarter,
specifically in our Advanced Materials, which is more exposed to OEM. And if you back that out, volumes
would have actually been down because we had very favorable mix in the quarter as we think about year-
over-year performance, especially. But sequentially, it was definitely down in the premium areas.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. If you think about it, the first half of the year, mix was incredibly strong and driving a lot of variable
margin growth and margin improvement. And there was a mix shift a bit in the third quarter. It wasn't just
autos. It was also outbound logistics constraints center, especially plastics business and getting high-value
products like Tritan to the market.

Demand is incredibly strong out there, but logistics, as you all know, are also [ challenging ]. So the
earnings could have been considerably better with those two factors, if they were a bit better.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

And Mark, again, thank you for the '22 guidance. On that guidance, can you just walk through the
segments and what -- how you expect them to perform in '22 versus '21?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Sure. So -- and here [ for me ], David. When you think about the overall segments, obviously, when you
start with the specialty businesses, as we've noted here, there's just tremendous growth that we see
possible on a number of factors, right? We've got volume and mix that should be a significant driver with
the economy, to some degree, growing with the markets in it.

And there's also a lot of pent-up demand out there to drive added additional growth versus GDP as
consumers fulfill desires that they can't get due to supply chain constraints and we're restocking inventory,
which has not at all happened yet in this year. So that's all quite positive.

And when you think about that, especially the pent-up demand part, I think that's more significant
in the AM segment. So we've given you a breakdown of AM being about 70% of that variable margin
improvement versus AFP. The innovation is also incredibly strong, especially in AM, where we're going to
continue to outperform the underlying markets in a significant way. You've seen this in this year.

You saw it last year in AM. You've seen it for the last decade. [ Recur ] offerings are also accelerating a lot
of growth for us in the SP business. You've seen $600 million in new business revenue from innovation. So
that's a good momentum that we take into next year.

So again, those are a bit more biased towards the AM as AFP businesses also getting traction. And then
market segment strategies. We continue to sort of focus on the markets that are growing, whether it's
luxury EVs, water treatment, care chemicals, where we pick up a lot of just natural market growth.

And importantly, keep in mind, a lot of the growth I just described, all of its high-value mix, both within
the segment and certainly at the corporate level. So there's a lot of leverage to have AM have a significant
increase in earnings next year when you think about those elements. And that's also true for AFP to have
good solid growth.

And then on the spread side, it's the same thing. You've got really headwinds obviously this year and
prices catching up to raws through the year.

And there will be -- with the price actions we're taking through the fourth quarter and a lot of effective
price increases on January 1 in businesses, you're going to see a pretty big step-up in earnings there from
spreads getting better as long as you believe raw materials are going to plateau relative to the back half of
this year and then trend off in the back half of next year, which is sort of our underlying assumption.

So then you pick up a pretty significant spread tailwind. It's the same thing. AFP has done a better job
of sort of keeping track with prices this year because they have a lot more cost pass-through contracts.
Half of the price increase in the third quarter was CPTs and AFP. Whereas AM, the interlayers business, in
particular, has a lot of annual price contracts.

So it takes a while to get those prices moving up. So again, that sort of supports that 70-30 split on the
spread side, too.

So those businesses are both going to deliver considerable growth in earnings in AM as well as when you
look at AFP on a recasted basis, minus the divestitures. So that's a lot of the growth there. Fibers, I think,
will also be renegotiating, putting prices in on probably more than half of their revenue come January 1.
And so earnings will improve there.

And then, of course, in CI, you've got normalization. That's going to happen in that business, but it's
going to be offset by volume growth that will be pretty substantial next year relative to this year in ag,
plasticizers and some other growth opportunities that we have as well as less shutdown.

So that all helps out. And of course, there's the cost tailwinds that we've given to you that's spread across
all of these segments that give them sort of added growth. So that's sort of how it balances out, David.

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

David L. Begleiter
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Perfect. And just on buybacks, Mark. Could buybacks approach $1 billion next year?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Willie, you want to take that one?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

David, thanks for the question. And maybe a little bit. As we think about every year, we're focused on
growing free cash flow to that $1 billion level. As we go into '22, obviously, we'll have the impact of
the divested EBITDA. But we believe fundamentally, with the working capital abating, given the raw
material assumptions that Mark just outlined, right now, year-to-date, we've had roughly $450 million of
inflationary pressures on working capital.

We see that reverting also as we continue to invest in circular and growth in our capacity assets. Net-net,
we think, excluding the dividend, debt being back, we'll have $600 million of free cash flow. Then if you
take proceeds from our divestitures on top of that, it definitely, is possible.

Operator

We can now take our next question from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners.

Kevin William McCarthy
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Mark, you announced a nice deal to divest the adhesives business, and of course, the Crystex deal is still
pending. I was wondering, if you could just walk us through, at a high level, what your thoughts are on
capital redeployment and just the portfolio composition moving forward. Does this bring the company to a
reasonably steady state in 2022? Or is there more work to do in terms of the mix in the portfolio over the
next couple of years?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So we certainly like the portfolio we now have. We think that AM, AFP businesses are very well-
positioned to deliver strong growth and earnings and increasingly improving margins. And the Fibers and
the olefins part or the CI part of the business is an integral part of our integration, scale, cash flow, et
cetera.

So we like the portfolio as it's configured right now as we look at deploying capital to your question, Kevin,
on delivering more growth from the total company.

When it comes to capital deployment, obviously, our free cash flow remains incredibly strong. And our
balance sheet now is also strong, with delevering being in our rearview mirror. So as we look forward, I
think we should think about how we deploy capital on sort of multiple fronts.

First, you should expect CapEx to increase a bit next year as we have the combination of specialty growth
and the first methanolysis plant that we're building here in Kingsport. So normal CapEx growth to support
our specialty strategy is in that $500 million to $600 million range. And then, of course, you've got a good
portion of that $250 million of the Kingsport plant being spent next year.

Now we're balancing some of the specialty CapEx between next year and pushing some of it to '23 to keep
this sort of imbalance across the 2 years, but CapEx will be a bit higher for that.

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

Then after that, you look at how am I going to deploy my balance sheet and cash, and there's really sort
of four buckets. The first is the potential to continue investing in the circular economy. We're pursuing
multiple projects beyond this first plant.

If we can achieve the conditions that we've talked about in the past about those being very attractive
investments and very stable sources of earnings, those projects could be very accretive to earnings and
ROIC. They're very attractive from a return point of view. And that could be a use of where we go with our
balance sheet.

The second, of course, is bolt-on M&A where we'd like to ramp up that level from where we've been in the
last couple of years. This is returning cash to shareholders, which I think will be significant as we move
forward. And, of course, a growing dividend.

So it will be a balance of capital deployment, I think, like we've always had across these areas. There's a
lot of attractive investment opportunities for us right now. And so we're really excited about how we can
sort of deploy capital and create growth for our shareholders.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from Frank Mitsch, Fermium Research.

Frank Joseph Mitsch
Fermium Research, LLC

Congrats on the divestitures. And just a follow-up, Mark, you did talk about uses of cash and possible
bolt-on M&As. What are the current valuation levels like? And what does your current pipeline look in that
regard?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So the bolt-on M&A pipeline, there's a number of ideas that we have that are -- can be attractive in
Advanced Materials and AFP, as we try and build out our additive portfolio in AFP and accelerate our access
to additional markets in Advanced Materials, especially in specialty plastics.

But as you've noted, Frank, you have to be careful. There's a lot of buy-side interest in pursuing M&A right
now as everyone has improved balance sheet and cash. So we're going to be disciplined as always. We're
proud of the fact that we don't overpay for assets, whether it's at the large ones we've done in the past or
the bolt-ons we're focusing on now.

And so we'll see. There may be some constraints because we're just not going to run around and overpay.

Frank Joseph Mitsch
Fermium Research, LLC

Got you. Got you. And if I could come back to the automotive piece. You referenced that you are doing
better than you had back in 2018. And obviously, with builds being off, where do you stand in the interplay
between your sales into the automotive space versus where the build rate is today? And how should
investors think about that interplay going into next year?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

So in Advanced Materials, our OEM exposure is bigger than AFP. That's another one of the differences,
AFPs. Their automotive exposure is about half refinish and half OEMs. So they're a lot more balanced in
the OEM production drama as refinished is just continuing to improve.

But on the OEM side, the supply chain is really short between OEM production and the production of our
interlayers. So that actually happens pretty quickly. So as they're adjusting their production rates weekly,
we're adjusting right there with them. So we're realizing that in a pretty quick fashion.

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

The performance films business has actually done really well through the third quarter because companies
-- the dealers -- the auto dealers are out there trying to upgrade the value they were getting on each car.
And so selling our paint protection films, window films was a nice adder to the few cars that they have to
sell.

But even that, seem start to catch up to us on what they have to sell right now.

So we're feeling a bit of that as we go into the third -- the fourth quarter.

But I think that as they have more cars to sell or produce more cars, you're going to see that pickup in
sales happen pretty quickly for us because there's really no inventory in the channel between us and the
primary market. So that, I think, is good news, as supply chains at some point are going to start getting
back in control and production will be there.

Clearly, end market demand is quite strong. So there's plenty of pent-up demand of people who want to
buy cars. When you look at just how much they're paying for used cars right now, they're clearly -- there's
a lot of demand out there. So I think, if we have a recovery, it will be pretty fast. And it will be a little bit
slower in AFP because that supply chain is [ longer ].

Frank Joseph Mitsch
Fermium Research, LLC

Fermium is going do its part to increase car sales, just so you know. And looking forward to December 7.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I just wanted to, I guess, talk about '22 initially or list your initial comments there. What are you
expecting, on the last question, as far as global auto production? And it appears to us that many
companies in your position are actually assuming rates below the IHS recovery. So maybe you can
comment on that first.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So on a 4Q basis, I think our view is below IHS. And I think IHS is from what I can tell, moderating
their view downwards for the fourth quarter. So production, obviously, what we're assuming is similar to
maybe a little bit better than the third quarter, but not any significant change to help in the quarter.

When it comes to next year, let's be honest, it's anyone's guess, right? When the supply chain on
components is going to improve and production is going to improve. I think, we are being cautious and not
assuming much improvement in the first half of the year. But we do assume that eventually, these issues
are going to get addressed and so there'll be some modest improvement in demand in the back half of the
year. But our guidance is not based on some substantial improvement in auto demand.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And then, I just wanted to also ask about strategy, I guess, going forward. Following the sale of Crystex
here, are there other properties within the portfolio that you think are noncore anymore?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

No. Not at this time. So we're very happy with the AM, AFP portfolio. The two obvious questions that come
up in the past is Fibers and olefins. On the Fibers front, I remind everyone that it is deeply integrated into

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

our overall cellulosic biopolymer business. We have a lot of biopolymers, [indiscernible] as we're selling off
of the stream in Advanced Materials and AFP.

And with the significant change in the world's view around waste plastic and climate, we just have
tremendous growth opportunities in front of us in both AM and AFP, with that integrated stream.

You're going to learn a lot more about that at Innovation Day where we're going to identify a bunch of
new opportunities we're pursuing that can be quite substantial. And textiles growth in itself, and Fibers,
has been actually quite strong. It's incredible how the textile growth had been 80% up year-over-year,
obviously, on the challenged market that still tremendous growth, offsetting not just total market decline,
but also that discontinued product.

So that business as well is at the position now where textile growth will offset to market decline or better.
And where, in fact, demand exceeding our expectations, where we're having to pull forward conversion of
tow assets to making textiles. So that business is on track and it generates a huge amount of cash flow
that supports all the investments we're making in growth in AM and AFP.

Olefins, it's a bit of a similar story where we're dramatically improving the quality of the earnings in that
business. Obviously, it's doing really well. But we've been taking a lot of actions over the last 3 years to
improve what is a new normal for this business, which is more likely probably around $300 million.

And there are things like closing the Singapore plant where we had a very disadvantaged raw material
energy position. That's a big upgrade in the quality of that business with it closed. A lot of operational
cost transformation work that we're doing across the company does flow into the big assets that flow into
Chemical Intermediates.

The RGP investment is giving us flexibility to reduce ethylene when it's not attractive and make it when
it is that it reduces sort of volatility around that. And we've got a new investment, we'll tell you about an
Innovation Day for modest capital that will significantly improve our olefin production flexibility.

And mix is getting better, right? The amines business inside that overall portfolio is great, growing and
stable. And we have a lot of our businesses on cost pass-through contracts that give us a certain amount
of stability, probably about 40% of ROCE.

There's a lot of things in the olefins space we've done to improve it. We're obviously disciplined about our
portfolio. But as you look at the significant growth opportunities we have in front of us and that balance
sheet strength that we want to leverage, deploy and grow the company, the cash from both Fibers and
olefins creates a lot of value. So when we look at the portfolio today for what we want to do now, this is
the right portfolio to grow.

Operator

The next question from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Congrats on being named in the Fortune Magazine. I think, you're one of the few chemical companies.
Also, you're creating this specialty brand with circular economy -- in the circular economic products
like Titan, on one hand. And then you have to fight commoditizing businesses, on the other hand, like
adhesives and tire additives.

And so like many other chemical companies, you have to constantly fight that battle between businesses
commoditizing and then innovating. So given that you think you have the right portfolio, to move that
portfolio solidly into specialties, would you look at making a big specialty acquisition? Or would you look at
just sort of continuing more bolt-ons?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

It's a fair question, P.J. We're always looking at how to enhance our portfolio. And obviously, we did
significant portfolio change way ahead of many with the addition [ solutaminco ] and divesting a lot of
commodity businesses. It's easy to forget history sometimes, but we moved out about $3.5 billion of
commodities and added $4.2 billion of revenue in specialties out of $10 billion is a huge portfolio change.

So we do really like a portfolio we have now. And yes, we had to optimize it around some underperforming
businesses. And I'm proud of our teams delivering on that restructuring activity, which is never easy to
sort of get to where we are.

We don't really feel the need to get a lot bigger. We think we're at a good scale to continue to invest in
fundamental R&D, product development as well as application development to grow. And I think that the
circular economy, on top of very attractive specialty growth and where we could take that with multiple
plants, is a game changer for how we can grow the company and how it could be valued.

So we really are focusing a lot on how we focus on circular. We've got two extremely advantaged streams.
Polyester and the way we can do circular economy is a very advantaged stream to grow in this current
macro environment that wants to get rid of plastic waste and improve our impact on climate.

And the cellulosic stream is also incredibly compelling. There's just a tremendous amount of opportunities
when you've got a polymer that's 60% biopolymer with our new recycling technology there, 40% recycled
plastic waste. And the biodegradability of the product is tunable for different applications.

And that last part about biodegradability is increasingly important, and we'll tell you more about that in
Innovation Day and some of the opportunities in front of us.

So we see a lot of growth in capital deployment in that direction to deliver a lot of organic growth from the
portfolio we have right now, where we don't really feel the pressure to run out and do some large M&A.
And at the prices today for large M&A that's really attractive, you're going to have a challenged situation in
getting a good return. So we don't really -- we're not really focusing on that.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then you made more propylene in the quarter using your refinery propylene investment,
and you had to buy less propylene as a result. Propylene had spiked. So when you look back, it looks like
that refinery investment made a lot of sense. But when you look back, what kind of returns do you think
you achieved on that? And can you just talk about that?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. P.J., this is Willie. That paid off in less than a year, and we're at multiples now. So it is a great
investment. And we're going to be excited to tell you about some additional options that we have to
further raise the floor as we think about the long term because of our ability to optimize our olefins at the
Longview site.

So again, the modest investment that Mark talked about is another option that we think similar to
RGP that will be multiples. And again, most of our capital, as Mark just highlighted, is focused on the
specialties and the new vector of circular. But we're still going to make the right optimizations to improve
the quality of the portfolio long-term.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc.

Aleksey V. Yefremov
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Could you discuss free cash flow conversion. What kind of conversion in terms of percent of EBITDA? What
percent of net income do we see next year?

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, Alex, this is Willie. What I would say is, again, at a growing EBITDA number, we strive to be around
that 50% level. If you think about $1 billion, $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion of EBITDA pre divestiture, and
we're going to grow back to that level as our focus based on our '22 bridge that we gave you earlier. So
think around that 50% level.

Aleksey V. Yefremov
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And Mark, a question for you on Circular Polymers business. Feedstock availability is a major issue, as
you know. Could you discuss what progress you're making this year in securing access to necessary waste
streams to grow that business?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Sure. Yes, we're making great progress. The advantage we have right now is we're pretty much
ahead of the industry and going to commercial scale and building the largest molecular recycling plant
[indiscernible] on the planet, I think, at this point. So that gives us an advantage in how we show up with
different suppliers for what we need.

There's no doubt that there's plenty of plastic waste. I mean, when you look at polyester just in the U.S.,
you've got over 20 million pounds of waste a year. About 40% of that is packaging and only about 25% to
30% of that can be recycled today. So -- and when it gets recycled, frankly, most of it goes into textiles,
not bottle to bottle.

So as you tap into that stream and the advantage of methanolysis is it can use what can't be mechanical
recycled from packaging, but it can also use carpet textiles, which almost all end up in landfill. So
accessing 100,000 tons of feedstock out of that significantly large number when you're the first showing
up to sort of secure, it is challenging but doable.

And the infrastructure out there clearly needs to improve in the U.S. as we get consumers to recycle more
and policy to support it and infrastructure in place to sort of recycle it as we look at plants 2, 3 and 4.

But as we look at the first one, we're confident that we can do this, and we will provide more detail in
Innovation Day. You're going to hear that a lot today about -- you'll get more detailed Innovation Day, but
it's a better forum to provide more detail on this question, which is incredibly important, and we're very
focused on it.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from Mike Sison of Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I didn't know you had a lot of material on Fermi and Ferrari, but in terms of your -- for AFP, can you
maybe talk about each of the businesses you noted in the prepared remarks that you felt these are
businesses that are well-positioned to grow? And maybe just talk about some of the growth prospects for
each of the remaining businesses in AFP?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

For next year, Mike?

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

Yes, for next year.

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So when you think about it in the specialty plastics world, we have just tremendous growth in Tritan.
Market demand exceeding our logistics capability serving the market, and we're even capacity constrained
into the second quarter, which is why we converted line over to serve Tritan. And now, we've got that
capacity coming in -- came [ online ] through the third quarter and a position to serve growth next year.

And it's coming from a range of markets. So there's the traditional markets that are being driven with
accelerated growth with our renewed recycled content like hydration that's delivering a lot of growth in
housewares, those traditional markets that we've always grown in are being accelerated.

And then on top of that, we're getting access to new markets that we wouldn't have normally had. The
story we shared with you with Stanley Black & Decker a great example. I mean, it's a power tool. We're
not normally in power tools. We normally go into optical clarity kind of applications with Tritan but this is
the housings for power tools.

And that customer adopted us because one, they're committed to addressing their Scope 3 climate from
suppliers and recycled content was a way to start making progress on that, especially as our technology
has a lower carbon footprint in a meaningful way relative to a normal fossil fuel process.

And they wanted to maintain their quality, right? So a lot of these applications, you can't use mechanical
recycling at all because when you're just blending mechanical recycling with virgin, the quality of the
product goes down on multiple dimensions.

And you can't have that kind of a compromise in the power tool. So we were able to provide recycled
content, carbon footprint improvement, zero compromise on the performance of the product. And that's an
incredibly important aspect of why we're growing.

And then the third part of it was actually a partnership for them. So they want to make sure they're
aligned with a company that could scale with them and it was going to be a reliable supplier of this
product. There's a lot of companies starting up out there, but they're start-ups, right? And they haven't
scaled their technology.

So when we can show up and provide a product where we've been -- have a 40-year history in doing
methanolysis and we've got 100 years of history of supplying products to people very reliably, that was
incredibly important to them and who they're going to choose. And we've had 10 other AM's sign up in this
quarter -- in the third quarter for those sort of similar set of [ reasons ], which we'll tell you more about.

But we're really well positioned. It's not just Tritan. It's crystal renew, which is our high clarity copolyester
recycled content and cosmetic packaging. It's a wide spectrum of things, including our cellulosic into
eyewear, et cetera. So a lot of growth in SP.

Obviously, the interlayers in performance films businesses are tied to the auto production recovery as we
discussed. But mix is still important, and we still see the mix improving faster than the absolute volume in
production because the first thing that the OEMs are going to produce are more luxury high-end value cars
when they start addressing their chip and component shortages.

And we'll pick up that volume with our products are aligned with that market and the mix value of that is
also incredibly important. So a lot of growth that can occur across the entire segment.

Gregory A. Riddle
Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications

Mark, you might want to do something similar to that for Additives & Functional Products as well?

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

Sure. Yes. Wow. Question from my own team. That's a new one. So Greg, on [ AFP ], I think it's the same
thing. Coatings has had tremendous growth this year. And that growth will continue. And there's a lot of
pent-up demand in coatings, as you all know, with our customers struggling significantly with supply chain
challenges.

So add to them ramping up just to build inventory to serve the seasonal demand next year is good as the
supply chain issues continue to get resolved on a availability point of view. So I think, we'll continue to see
very strong growth there.

The care chemicals business has great steady growth, same with water treatment that will continue going
into next year. And then [ Animal Nutrition ] is really accelerating their growth in higher-value formulated
solutions through the 3F acquisition. And there's, of course, recovery in the aviation business. So there's
a lot of different vectors across the entire segment that remains that's well-positioned for growth in the
markets that it serves.

And then of course, we've got innovation like Tetrashield in the packaging that will be a vector of growth.
And continued growth in some of the care chemical opportunities and some really exciting new ones that
we'll tell you about on Innovation Day.

Michael Joseph Sison
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. And just a quick follow-up on Chemical Intermediates. EBIT margins have been in the high teens
for the last couple of quarters. It sounds like, it will stay maybe in that range for maybe the next 3
quarters. And then, I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that you felt it would normalize in the
second half. So just curious what normal means these days, but any thoughts of where that level kind of
settles in versus much lower levels in the past?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Mike. So I think that when we think about normalized, we think that's going to be around $300
million. Obviously, there's a path to normal as we go through next year where we expect, at least, in the
first half, market conditions to stay relatively tight.

Obviously, there is some loosening of those markets even as we go into the fourth quarter based on our
guidance. A lot of it is -- we had tremendously high-value spot sales and incredibly tight market conditions
when you look at the second and third quarter. As. demand gets a little bit more sort of balanced, those
spot sales go away, and that's a bit of that headwind you're going to see from 3Q to 4Q for CI.

But the overall fundamental dynamics of these markets at the derivative level, in particular, I think we
expect to remain reasonably tight as we go into the first half of next year and then assume normalization
towards that $300 million level in long-term. So -- and I already went through all the details of how we've
raised that, what is normal up in the actions that we've taken. I won't repeat it. But there's a lot of things
we've done to improve this business, and this new investment will be another step change improvement
when it comes online.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from Matthew DeYoe from Bank of America.

Matthew Porter DeYoe
BofA Securities, Research Division

So I want to hammer in a little bit more on the strategy to offset dilution given all these sales. Will you
look to pay off any debt given the lost earnings? And if this is all -- or sorry, is it all buyback? And if it's
the latter, I guess, why not execute more aggressively on a buyback now ahead of proceed collection just
given your cash balance?

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

CFO & Senior VP

Thanks for the question. Let me frame it this way, which is we expect total proceeds to be about $1.8
billion from these transactions and actually $1.7 billion in that over the next few months. So as we look
ahead also, this was about 8% of our EBITDA. So as you think about the flow of market cap, we're looking
at roughly $1.2 billion. I'll look at that as probably the floor.

As you think about offsetting dilution and paying taxes, that will raise the number up to roughly $1.5
billion or so. We're going to put that money to work starting here in Q4 with the tires closing, which we
expect here in the near term.

With that, also given our balance sheet on the tires position, we don't expect to pay down any debt related
to that. Obviously, as we look at 2022, we'll see at the timing of getting the proceeds and also managing
our debt ladder as we look at '22. We'll have a refinancing in the August time frame and have plenty of
time to optimize that when we get there.

Matthew Porter DeYoe
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And I know COVID obfuscate us a little bit. But if we were to look between, I don't know, 2015 or
2018 and 2021, what would pro forma growth for AFP have been x the problem child with Crystex and
adhesives just given -- maybe even a better question like what should we expect as the pickup in organic
growth in the next 5 years versus the last 5 given the lapse in these businesses?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So if you looked at -- and we will be providing a recast, so you can see it in specific numbers. But
roughly what you'd see between 2018 and '21 is a roughly flat similar to EBIT from '18 to '21, when you
have excluded sort of 1/3 of AFP as we've been discussing it. So I think that's quite stable when you
consider the China trade war and the pandemic and sort of recovering out of it.

And that is based on -- when you look at it relative to '21, an improvement in volume and mix that's been
meaningful.

Spreads are probably a bit challenged relative to '18 just as pricing is still catching up to raws. But overall,
very well-positioned segment to deliver pretty strong earnings growth next year relative to that recast
number.

And that volume mix comes from everywhere. It's coatings, it's animal nutrition, it's care chemicals water
treatment, even specialty fluids except for aviation in '21. So -- but that will obviously start correcting
itself as well as you go into '22 on that front. So it's an across-the-board sort of volume mix story.

Operator

We can now take our next question from Daniel Rizzo of Jefferies.

Daniel Dalton Rizzo
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Mark, a quick question on your portfolio. I mean, it has definitely changed over the years, but you still
have a mix of specialty and nonspecialty businesses. So if you look over the course of 12 to 18 months,
are higher raw materials good or bad for you? Or is it neutral over time?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

If you look at it on a combined basis, it's probably -- from a material point of view, I would say you got to
then convert that to spreads. Raw materials are up everywhere, but obviously, prices are up more than
raw materials and CI where we're lagging price-wise in the specialties.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

Those two do hedge each other out. That actually provides earnings stability. So if you're focused on
earnings stability, a bit of a balance when you've got CI at just 20% of your earnings actually provides
some benefits in times like this as your prices are catching up to specialties. And the opposite will be true
next year as the price and spreads will improve and the specialty, obviously, you're going to have some
spread normalization in CI.

The important part of our strategy and our story is not spread, right? We've been very clear about this,
right? Our strategy is growing volume and high-value mix in that volume against an asset base that we
continue to upgrade with that mix to deliver increasing ROIC as well as deploying more capital for that
high-value mix. And that's why you drive value long-term, right? It's not to have spreads bouncing up and
down. And so, they actually sort of hedge each other out and provide some balance, and that will be true
of next year like it is -- has been this year.

Daniel Dalton Rizzo
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And a quick one, a follow-up on -- I mean, you've talked about the bolt-on M&As. Like is the focus
mainly in the U.S. or other opportunities ex-U.S.?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, as we look at the pipeline, it's -- we're focused globally. As Mark highlighted previously, it's obviously
looking at our specialty plastics business and across the new AFP portfolio. And we're focused on that and
also on our circular projects from a growth standpoint. So it's about focus now that we've completed the
2/3 action -- or the actions on the 1/3, so that you can see the value of the new AFP.

Operator

We can now take our next question from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.

Robert Andrew Koort
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Mark, I was just observing that over the last 6 months, the '21 earnings for you guys seem to have
climbed about 14% or 15%, at least the estimates and the stock's done the opposite. It's down about
15%. You've had this derating that seems very consistent with commodity companies, commodity
chemicals like a Dow or Lyondell, they've sort of seen that same derating.

And yet you've been on this evolution upgrade the portfolio. And so there seems to be a pretty stark
dislocation from the market perception or appreciation of those efforts and what I would guess are the
internal expectations and perceptions there.

So I guess at some point, does the Board decide to get more aggressive or consider an LBO or maybe
as Matt suggested, do an ASR before the market catches on to what I would suspect you guys believe
internally?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Well, I'm not going to answer that question, Bob. But what I can tell you is the Board is incredibly excited
about our strategy and the value creation opportunity that it presents. In the end, you, the market, decide
what the company is worth, not us.

But as we focus on what we're doing in the specialties, as you noted, I think we're going to demonstrate
incredibly strong growth next year relative to this year in that part of the portfolio. I think, we're going to
manage capital deployment in a responsible way to deploy it in ways that create a lot of very attractive
ROIC growth, leveraging the core technologies and platforms that we have.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

And then you pile on the circular where we could deploy significant capital, if we can get these projects
done under the conditions that we have that they provide stable earnings is a significant vector of new
growth that isn't remotely factored into our valuation from what I can see at this point.

So there's a huge amount of upside as you're pointing out, and where I think our stock price can go from
today. And as that all plays out, and our balance sheet strength that is quite significant now going forward
gets deployed, there's a huge amount of upside. And we're confident investors are going to see that value
and invest in the company.

And that's why we're doing our Innovation Day in December is to say, lay that all out for you to make sure
all of you can see sort of how that can create compounded growth in earnings and cash flow as we go
forward.

Robert Andrew Koort
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. You mentioned in Advanced Materials, a decent chunk of contracts that reset annually. I was
wondering, if you could give us more description there. Is that typically or exclusively to the automakers?
Is there any opportunity to shorten up those contract durations, so you can have more market-based
pricing or give us some sense of that?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes, these contracts are between us and the glass companies, right? So we don't sell to the OEMs. We're
selling to the glass companies that use our films for laminating that glass. It's been a traditional structure
in this market since we bought it with these annual contracts. We are looking at how we negotiate both
price and structure to these contracts going forward.

Obviously, in years of declining raw materials, we like them. In years where raw materials spike up,
especially when they spike up like this, it's a problem. It's the same issue in Fibers, where you've got
these annual or multi-annual contracts where the prices are locked in.

And so when you had that huge spike up in energy and raw materials in the back half of this year, you're
going to sort of have to wait until January to sort of recover it. But we are aggressively going out with
price increases in both interlayers and Fibers, Jan 1.

Operator

And we can now take our next question from [ Paretosh Misra ] of Berenberg.

Unknown Analyst

With regard to your PRT start-up next year, it sounds like there's a big demand for recycled plastics. Can
you give us a sense as to what percentage of volumes are already booked or contracted? And would you
announce an expansion, if you say, are 70%, 80% booked?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

So the uptake in engagement from brands has far exceeded our expectations on the specialty side. We
were thinking we have swing assets where we can make our specialty plastics or PET for packaging. And
we thought we'd actually be selling a lot of PET for packaging, and that's looking like that's not going to be
the case because the specialty demand is so strong.

So I think, we're in very good position for loading the asset pretty quickly into the markets. We're not
going to disclose the specific percent number. But I think, it's going to be quite robust and quick.

As regards to demand that goes beyond our first plant, yes, the demand is very much there. And that's
why we're working so diligently right now with countries and brands around the world, especially in U.S.
and Europe right now, who want to solve those challenges.

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

When the brands look at this situation, right? They've got two goals. They got to address packaging waste,
specifically plastic waste is getting a lot of attention. But if you switch to plastics [indiscernible] else, you
still got to manage that waste.

And so as you look at this, they've committed to very high recycled content targets, and there isn't
remotely enough mechanical recycling product out there to supply that need reliably. In addition, the price
of mechanical recycled rPET is going up dramatically in Europe and now as well in the U.S. And the brands
are worried about how much that's going to keep going up.

And they are also doing life cycle analysis on the carbon footprint of not just plastic, but alternative
materials that they could consider. And unfortunately, you run into a problem, which is all the alternative
materials have a worse climate footprint. You recently saw Wendy's switched from coated paper cups to
plastic because plastics got a much better climate footprint and can be recycled where the coated paper
cannot be recycled.

So the brands are very focused on how to recycle plastic for a lot of applications and realizing that
molecular recycling is the only way forward, especially long-term, if you want to keep your product quality
the same, then mechanical recycle is limited in how it can be used. And it degrades over time.

So if you want an infinite solution, you've got to have molecular recycling as part of the solution.

So engagement is strong. The need to build more plants is there. And we're driving to find a way to
do that under the right conditions. And they are attracted to us because our scale -- our technology is
scalable now where the start-ups are still sort of piloting and trying to figure out how to scale up. So that's
also drawing a lot of attention to us.

So we feel good about where we're at. We're excited about doing this. But to be clear, we're not going to
build any additional plants unless we get the sort of contractual commitments for offtake to give us stable
earnings.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. And then just as a follow-up because CRT process can take a lot more different types of plastics
than PRT. So how should we think about the PRT versus CRT mix as these -- both these processes start
ramping up in the years ahead?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Well, first of all, they're actually a great complement of technologies together at this site because we
have a unique proprietary way to separate unsorted waste plastic that just separate it from polyester to
everything else at a much lower cost. So that's one of the feedstock sourcing advantage that we have that
I should have mentioned earlier.

And that allows us to take that mixed waste plastic in the CRT, take it into our acetyl stream and make
cellulosic biopolymers that gives us a lot of sourcing flexibility. So we see both technologies creating a lot
of value, and the CRT is also, through the cellulosic, drawing a lot of attention.

We've always had -- we've had a biopolymer for 100 years, if you want to go back to acetate film with
Kodak. And we've created this huge spectrum of applications off of that core technology in AM, AFP and
Fibers.

But with the recent change in focusing on climate, focusing on plastic waste, instead of recycling, you can
also have biodegradable products as a way to sort of have circular life and that's drawing a lot of attention
around the cellulosic stream. We can take back polymer and put it back in the CRT or we can also provide
ones that biodegrade based on the application. So a lot of interesting growth there as well that we're
really excited about.

We can now take our next question from John Roberts of UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I thought the formic acid business was also in the underperforming category. I may be confusing
underperforming with noncore, but has that improved a lot now and is part of the core operations?

William Thomas McLain
CFO & Senior VP

John, this is Willie. On the formic side, yes, it's a much smaller component. It's a fraction of the size of the
two businesses that we sold as we've taken operational and transformational and the operations there. We
think, we've got the results that we need and the performances is adequate.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. And then are automotive films and automotive coatings ingredients being impacted equally by the
automotive curtailment?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

So from a film's point of view in Advanced Materials, the interlayers and the aftermarket performance
films are more impacted. They're more OEM exposed than our coating additives, where about half of it
goes into refinish. And therefore, that's obviously a lot more stable in the current situation. So we feel
more of the impact on the film side.

Gregory A. Riddle
Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications

Let's make the next question the last one, please.

Operator

We can now take our final question from [ J.D. Panda of On Field Research. ]

Unknown Analyst

Just one question really is on your guidance for 2022. I mean, hearing in the call and hearing you talk
about so many factors that are going to catch up and be beneficial. Just wondering, are you being just
very conservative with regards to your EPS range of 9.5% to 10% because considering all the sort
of catch-up on raw materials and the volume leverage that you were talking about in your specialty
businesses, I'm just trying to understand what is the conservatism, if there is?

Mark J. Costa
Chairman & CEO

Look, I wouldn't call it conservative or optimistic at this point. I think, what I'd say is we're sharing our
best thinking with you right now of what we know. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty in the future.

Things we're certain about is we know we can control our costs, right? And we have a very aggressive
transformation program going that when you look at operational transformation cost cutting plus variable
comp tailwind, that's about $200 million of tailwind that offsets about $80 million to $100 million of
inflation.

We know that we're going to invest in growing this business. We have tremendous growth opportunities
right there across our portfolio. And so we have growth investments in that sort of $50 million to $75
million range that is controllable. We can control the pace of that based on how the market is doing. And
that does include some preproduction expense on starting up methanol and some other plants when you
think about that number.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

19

EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2021

But those are controllable. Obviously, there's uncertainty about where CI is going to go. I think we've got
a reasonable assumption, but we'll see. We'll defer to the -- to some other companies on that and where
the markets are.

And then on the specialty side, what I'd say is we do feel good about the growth potential, the innovation
to create levered growth on these markets and that spreads will be a tailwind. But there's still a lot of
uncertainty about automotive demand as many of these questions have highlighted, there's uncertainty
about where raw materials are going to trend and how they progress from where we are now into next
year as well as distribution costs.

So there's a lot of uncertainties out there that none of us can, frankly, predict.

So what we're confident is if you look at it in three buckets, you've got divested earnings offset by share
repurchases. You got a bucket of CI spread normalization offset by cost reductions. And then you're asking
a question, which is can specialties grow next year relative to this year in variable margin. And I think
we've laid out a case where we think the answer to that is very much yes.

But I'm not going to get into trying to be more precise about that until we get to January. We're going to
have a better look at the world we live in at that point.

Just to wrap up, what I'd like to say is deeply appreciate the questions, the interest in the company. We're

the different ways we can grow this company. and create value. So we look forward to sharing that with
