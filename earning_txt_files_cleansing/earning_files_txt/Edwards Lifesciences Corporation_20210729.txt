Presentation

Operator

Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Edwards Lifesciences Corporation's Second Quarter
2021 Results. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn
the conference over to our host, Mark Wilterding, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You
may begin.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks a lot, Diego. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike
Mussallem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Ullem, Chief Financial Officer. Just after the
close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2021 financial results. During
today's call, management will discuss those results included in the press release and accompanying
financial schedules and then use the remaining time for Q&A.

Please note that management will be making forward-looking statements that are based on estimates,
assumptions and projections. These statements include, but aren't limited to, financial guidance and
expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation,
reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. These statements speak only as
of the date on which they are made, and Edwards does not undertake any obligation to update them after
today.

Additionally, the statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those associated
with the pandemic that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning factors that
could cause these differences and important product safety information may be found in the press release,
our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and Edwards' other SEC filings, all of which are available on the
company's website at edwards.com.

Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring
to non-GAAP financial measures. Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. Reconciliations between
GAAP and non-GAAP numbers mentioned during the call are included in today's press release.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for his comments. Mike?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Mark. We are encouraged by clear signs of recovery during the second quarter. Vaccine adoption
in key regions has contributed to an increasing number of patients seeking and, most importantly,
receiving treatment. At Edwards, our dedication of providing innovative solutions for people fighting
cardiovascular disease around the world motivates our employees every day. We never stopped our
aggressive pursuit of breakthrough technologies with the potential to help an even broader group of
patients.

Last year, we noted that we were in the midst of the onset of this tragic global pandemic. There were more
than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN valves in that second quarter.
This quarter, more than 30,000 patients were treated with SAPIEN valves, an indication that more patients
are benefiting from our life-changing technologies than ever before.

Comparisons to 2020 are challenging as last year marked an extraordinary time for structural heart
patients, especially during the second quarter when the COVID surge overwhelmed hospitals and
undermined regular ongoing care. Patients and their doctors around the world were forced to weigh
the risk of COVID versus the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease. Fortunately, we're now
experiencing encouraging signs of increased patient confidence to visit their physician.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Turning now to our recent results. We're pleased to report better-than-expected second quarter sales
of $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis from the year ago period. All 4 product groups
delivered large increases in sales led by TAVR. Total company sales increased sequentially versus Q1. And
importantly, sales grew 11% on a 2-year compounded annual basis compared to the strong pre-pandemic
second quarter of 2019.

While hospital heart teams have not been reporting significant backlogs, we believe that procedure rates
in Q2 were lifted because patients who previously postponed their doctor visits returned and were treated.
We are raising our full year outlook for 2021. We remain cautious about the mixed trends of the recovery
from the pandemic. And additionally, we expect a more pronounced summer seasonality associated
with a pent-up demand for vacations. Yet given the better-than-expected year-to-date performance
and momentum exiting the quarter, we now expect total sales growth to be in the high teens versus our
previous guidance of mid-teens.

In TAVR, second quarter global sales were $902 million, up 48% on an underlying basis versus the year
ago period or 14% on a 2-year compounded annual basis. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was
comparable with Edwards growth in the second quarter.

Globally, our average selling price remains stable as we continued to exercise price discipline. We continue
to be optimistic about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many
patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated.

In a recent article in the American Journal of Cardiology reported -- it reported on the survival of severe
AS patients since the introduction of TAVR in 2008. The analysis included clinical data on 4,000 patients
obtained at the Mass General and concluded that, in the TAVR era, overall survival of patients with severe
AS has doubled.

The long-term potential, along with the rebound in procedures, reinforces our view that this global
TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, up from more than $5 billion today. And beyond 2024,
bolstered by 2 pivotal trials currently being enrolled, we believe the impact of treating this deadly disease
before symptoms and before the disease becomes severe has the potential to transform the lives of even
more patients.

In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew sequentially over Q1 and over 50% on a year-over-year basis. Our U.S.
TAVR volumes were well above pre-COVID levels as our 2-year compounded annual growth rate was in
the mid-teens. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable. We're encouraged that U.S. TAVR
procedures grew as vaccinations increased and patients decided to seek treatment during the quarter.
Growth was broad-based across both high- and low-volume centers.

Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our sales grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis, and
we estimate that total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. On a 2-year compounded annual basis,
we estimate that sales grew in the low double digits in the second quarter versus 2019. And although
we're encouraged by the strong results, vaccination progress outside the U.S. creates uncertainty for the
remainder of the year. Long term, though, we see excellent opportunities for OUS growth as we believe
international adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low.

TAVR procedure and Edwards growth in Europe also rebounded significantly on a year-over-year basis.
Edwards growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-
based across all countries. Patient flow recovered throughout the quarter, although it remains suboptimal
in several countries and uncertainty among patients about the urgency of their disease.

In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3 and broad growth across centers
of all sizes. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country
driven by the fact that aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease amongst this large
elderly population. As previously announced, we received approval earlier in the second quarter for
SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk, and we continue to anticipate increased treatment rates in Japan
when reimbursement is approved in Q3.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Now turning to several recent TAVR clinical trial highlights. Last week at the TVT conference, data on the
Vancouver's TAVR economic study were presented, which further demonstrated the favorable economic
value of our SAPIEN 3 platform. A comparison of 1,100 patients was conducted to assess the economic
impact of next-day discharge. The SAPIEN 3 platform, with a minimalist approach, achieved better patient
outcomes, 30 days post procedure and enhanced resource utilization, which resulted in meaningful cost
improvements.

Also at TVT, results from the PARTNER III bicuspid registry showed similar outcomes to other TAVR
patients as well as significant improvement in patient symptoms and quality of life. We remain as
optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity as patients and clinicians increasingly
understand the significant benefits of TAVR therapy supported by the substantial body of compelling
evidence.

In summary, based on the strength that we saw in the second quarter, we have confidence that the
underlying TAVR sales will grow around 20% in 2021 versus our previous expectation of 15% to 20%
growth.

Turning to TMTT. We continue to be very pleased with our clinical outcomes as they remain a key driver to
treating many patients in need and unlocking the significant long-term growth opportunity. We continue
to be committed to ensuring procedural success in employing a high-touch clinical support model. We are
progressing in the enrollment of 5 pivotal trials across our differentiated portfolio to support therapies for
patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. We have initiated use of the PASCAL PRECISION
platform and are currently enrolling CLASP trials, and early physician feedback has been positive. We
remain on track for U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year.

We advanced our clinical experience with transcatheter replacement as we continued enrollment with our
TRISCEND II pivotal trial for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement. We also continue to treat patients with both
our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the
MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos.

As we continue to build a body of compelling clinical evidence, we are pleased with the recent data from
several late-breaking presentations across our comprehensive TMTT portfolio. In mitral, an analysis at
EuroPCR of over 2,100 commercially treated patients provided further evidence of the efficacy, safety
and ease of use of the PASCAL platform. In addition, 2-year results from the CLASP study of PASCAL
highlighted strong and sustained MR reduction, as well as high survival rates for both FMR and DMR
patients. And in tricuspid, 30-day outcomes for our TRISCEND study for the EVOQUE tricuspid valve
replacement system demonstrated favorable technical feasibility and safety, along with significant
improvements in tricuspid regurgitation and quality of life for patients.

Similarly, outcomes for our PASCAL tricuspid valve repair resulted in significant TR reduction, low
complication rates and sustained functional and quality of life improvements at 6 months.

Turning to the financial performance in TMTT. Global sales of $22 million was driven by the continued
adoption of our PASCAL platform as we activated more centers across Europe. We now expect 2021 TMTT
sales of $80 million to $100 million, up from our previous sales guidance of $80 million. We continue to
estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025, and we are pleased
with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid
valve disease.

In Surgical Structural Heart, record second quarter global sales of $237 million was up 42% on an
underlying basis versus the year ago period. Revenue growth was lifted by increased adoption of our
premium RESILIA technologies around the world and rebounding surgical aortic treatment rates in the
U.S. We were encouraged by steady improvement in global surgical procedure volumes as we progress
through the quarter.

We experienced strong year-over-year adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including continued
adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve, the KONECT RESILIA aortic tissue valve conduit as
well as our new MITRIS RESILIA surgical mitral valve, which was launched in Japan in the second quarter.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

We believe the adoption of RESILIA tissue valves will be further bolstered by the 4-year mitral data from
our COMMENCE clinical trial presented at the recent meeting of the American Association of Thoracic
Surgery as well as the growing body of RESILIA clinical evidence, which demonstrates excellent durability
of this tissue technology even in the high-pressure mitral position.

In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we're raising our full year surgical
structural heart guidance. We now expect underlying sales growth in the mid-teens versus our previous
expectation of high single-digit growth. We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion surgical structural
heart market will grow in the mid-single digits through 2026.

In Critical Care, second quarter global sales were $215 million, up 27% on an underlying basis versus the
year ago period. Growth was driven by balanced contributions from all product lines led by HemoSphere
sales in the U.S. as hospital capital spending continues to show signs of recovery. Demand for products
used in high-risk surgeries remains strong, and demand for the ClearSight noninvasive finger cup used in
elective procedures accelerated following its recovery to pre-COVID levels in the first quarter.

In Smart Recovery, we received FDA clearance for the software algorithm that powers our Hypotension
Prediction Index, HPI, on HemoSphere and the Acumen IQ cuff. The noninvasive Acumen IQ cuff provides
clinicians with an important new tool to reduce hypotension in a broader range of patients, including those
that do not require an arterial line.

In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year Critical Care
guidance to low double digits versus our previous expectation of high single-digit growth. We remain
excited about our pipeline of critical care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery
technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients.

And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Thanks a lot, Mike. I am pleased with the momentum we experienced as we exited the first quarter
continued in the second quarter across all of our product lines. While we're expecting some headwinds
due to the summer vacation schedule and flare-ups of COVID in various regions, we're optimistic about
favorable business conditions for Edwards.

Total sales grew 49% year-over-year as patients increasingly were more confident about pursuing
treatment in the second quarter. Of course, the unusually high growth rate also reflects depressed sales
in last year's second quarter due to COVID. Our underlying 2-year compounded growth rate in the second
quarter was 11%, another indicator that conditions are improving. The much stronger-than-expected sales
performance lifted by an unexpectedly high procedure volume fell through to the bottom line, resulting in
adjusted earnings per share of $0.64.

Based upon our strong start to the year and positive outlook, we are raising our previous sales guidance
ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we now expect sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion; for TAVR, $3.4
billion to $3.6 billion; for TMTT, $80 million to $100 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $875 million to
$925 million; and for Critical Care, $800 million to $850 million.

Now regarding second half margins, we're intending to resume a higher rate of spending as commercial
activities increase, especially as we continue to build our clinical and field teams to support our planned
new product introductions in multiple regions. In addition, we expect growth in research and development
expenses as our clinical trial activities increase. The combination of these actions contributes to our more
moderated guidance for margins in the second half.

We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high end of our previous range of
$2.07 to $2.27. While public health conditions remain uncertain, we're projecting total sales in the third
quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.29 billion and $1.37 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per
share of $0.50 to $0.56.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Now I'll cover additional details of our results. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin
was 75.9% compared to 74.4% in the same period last year when we experienced lower sales and
substantial costs responding to COVID. This increase was also driven by a more profitable product mix,
partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange.

We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Selling,
general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $374 million or 27.2% of sales compared
to $275 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs, including
performance-based compensation, increased commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior
year and the strengthening of OUS currencies, primarily the euro.

We're planning to see a ramp-up in the expenses noted above in the second half as COVID-related
restrictions subside to support continued growth. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A expenses as
a percent of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%. Research and development expenses in the
quarter grew 24% to $225 million or 16.4% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued
investments in our transcatheter innovations including increased clinical trial activity.

We are planning to ramp up expenses in the second half as we invest in developing new technologies
and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT. For the full year 2021, we continue to
expect research and development expenses as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range.

During the second quarter, we recorded a $103 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent
consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.14. This gain was excluded from
the adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 that I mentioned earlier. This reduction reflects accounting
adjustments associated with reduced expectations of making future milestone payments for previous
acquisitions. This accounting impact does not impact our 2021 guidance.

Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.3%. This rate included a larger-than-expected
590 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full
year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15% including an estimated benefit of
5 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.

Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter reported sales growth by 450 basis points or $29 million
compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $70 million positive impact or
about 1.5% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020.

Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 180 basis points
compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates positively impacted our second quarter
EPS by $0.01.

Free cash flow for the second quarter was $457 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of
$526 million less capital spending of $69 million.

Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share
repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.6
billion in cash and investments as of June 30. Average shares outstanding during the second quarter were
630 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.3 million shares during the second quarter
for $112 million. In the first half of the year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average price of
$85. In May, we obtained Board approval to increase our share repurchase authorization and currently
have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the program. We now expect our average diluted shares
outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 million to 635 million guidance range.

And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Scott. So we're pleased with our performance in the first half of 2021. To serve the many
patients suffering from structural heart disease, we never stopped investing in our people, our innovative

technologies and our new growth capacity. As patients and clinicians increasingly recognize the significant
benefits of transcatheter-based technologies supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence, we
remain optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity.

Our foundation of leadership, combined with a robust product pipeline, positions us well for continued
success. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark.

Mark Wilterding
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you very much, Mike. Before we open it up for questions, I'm excited to announce that our 2021
investor conference will take place on Wednesday, December 8, at our headquarters here in Irvine,
California. This event will include updates on our latest technologies, views on longer-term market
potential as well as our outlook for 2022. Please look for more information on our website next month.
With that, we're ready to take questions now, Diego. [Operator Instructions] Diego?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Congrats on such strong performance across the board. I just have 2 quick questions on the guidance.
First is just on the short term and some of the comments you made about this quarter. Just curious, you
mentioned the backlog dynamic, which is not something you really talked a lot about before. Was that a
major factor in the quarter? Can you quantify that? And any thoughts on what that looks like into Q3 or
the back half?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Bob. And we were pleased with the results. They were broad-based. Your observation is
correct. We really haven't talked about this much in the past. Most of our data historically has come from
talking to our heart teams really around the world, but especially in the U.S. And when we talk to them,
they really don't know the difference in their backlogs compared to what they've seen in the past. But we
believe, based on a number of sources, some of the anecdotal conversations, some of it watching what's
going on with other companies like insurers or others in the health care space, they noted much more
patient activity.

And we believe that this flow of patients, so patients visiting their primary care physicians, patients going
back to their general cardiologists, their general cardiologist referring them on to heart teams, all those
things that we think were potentially delayed, that there was a real pickup in the second quarter.

And because of the rate of treatment being much larger than anything we've ever seen in our past, we
believe that, that's in there. It's not based on -- we only have heart data, Bob, to quantify how much that
was, but we believe that, that was a key part of what happened.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And just curious. And then that kind of feeds into my second question, which is also around the
guidance for the back half on total revenue, which I think you call for roughly a 3% decline sequentially
from what you did in Q2 and then Q4 being kind of flat with Q2. And I'm just curious, maybe either for
Mike or for Scott, just can you maybe talk about some of the moving parts that went into that guidance or
you expect a little bit of a decline sequentially. And then Q4 similar to Q2, I might have thought that would
have been a little bit higher given the momentum, but just curious of the moving parts you're assuming
there.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean you've got it right, and I'll invite Scott to come in and add more color to it. But you're right.
We did exit with momentum, and it was strong momentum coming out of Q2. But at the same time, we're
mindful of the fact that we probably got some help in Q2 from some of these patients coming off the
sideline.

Also, all of us are all acutely aware of what's going on with the pandemic and the recent surge that's
happening. And although this hasn't had a dramatic impact on the health care system so far, we think it
can have impact. And so that's also baked into our thinking.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Q3, we think there's going to be a pronounced seasonality associated with people, both in the health care
system and patients themselves wanting to get away and take a vacation. And so all those went into our
thinking. And I don't know, Scott, if there's much to add to that, but...

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

No, that's a good summary. If we would not have exceeded our Q2 sales expectations by as much as we
did, you probably would have seen a different sequential trend from Q2 to Q3 as we continue to grow,
recover through this pandemic. But we just exceeded Q2 so much that we do think we'll see some of that
seasonality that Mike talked about and then going back up to a more normalized level of sales when we
get into the fourth quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on a nice sprint here. Mike, maybe a big picture question. When I look at the guide here, the
beat in the quarter came from TAVR. I think there was some nervousness around slowdown in Asia
Pac, Japan due to the COVID outbreak. How -- when you think about those regions, how those regions
normalized, and given U.S. was so strong, it offset that weakness. When I look at the guide, every other
segment was raised. I'm curious, when you thought about the guide, was it some concerns around these
outbreaks? Is that within the thought process around TAVR guidance?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Vijay. One of the things you have to be a little bit careful of when you look at growth rates
and use that as a way of measuring Q2 is to be a little bit more reflective on what the climate was like in
Q2 of last year. So Japan just didn't decline as much as the U.S. and Europe last year. And so while the
growth rate looks like less in Japan and it looks like it was less of a performer, actually, Japan was doing
quite well and grew very nicely.

Similarly, Europe didn't get hit quite as hard in Q2 as the U.S. did as the U.S. really got hit hard. So
Europe has actually been performing, we think, at a pretty high level. Now having said that, you correctly
note that, hey, Japan since a near lockdown in portions of the region, there's portions of Europe that are
still troublesome, although there's encouraging signs in Europe as well. I just saw some data this morning
that said vaccination rates in Europe are comparable to U.S. vaccination rates. And we know of some
places that are under pressure in the U.S.. So we've taken all that into account when we provided our
guidance. But when we look backward at Q2, we feel like we saw a strength across each of the regions.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's helpful, Mike. And then one maybe on the TAVR portion in Structural Heart. I want to make sure
I heard this correctly. Did you say mid-singles at both outlook through 2025? I think there's been some
concerns about cannibalization. I'm curious, is that a comment on the entire market being up mid-singles?
Or is that more specific for Edwards?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

No. So what we were commenting on was the total market, and we said that, that total market, this $1.8

surgical structural heart. So it's not just valves. It has more than that in it. But we're trying to send a
signal that we think that's still a growth market, and that is with the TAVR impact. So we consider -- we
think TAVR is definitely going to have impact on surgery during that period of time, but it's going to grow

in spite of that, okay. We've enjoyed some very nice growth for a number of reasons, a lot of it built on
just the strength of our premium RESILIA platform.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

I would just add to that. One of the things that happened with -- when there's a greater awareness of
structural heart disease and valvular disease is that more patients are just coming into the system. And
many of those patients who have isolated aortic stenosis are great candidates for TAVR. But there are a lot
of patients who come into the system who need surgery, and it's one of the reasons why we expect that
business to continue to grow.

Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a nice quarter. Mike, I'd love to hear you talk about the trends you're seeing in your mitral
and tricuspid businesses. The $80 million to $100 million guidance for this year, what percent is mitral?
What percent is tricuspid? And how significant are clinical sales in that TMTT number?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

So clinical sales are a portion of it, but it's minor. I don't know the exact, Larry, but I would guess it's in
the -- maybe it's in the 10% range of overall sales. The market itself feels like the growth of transcatheter
mitral and tricuspid did pick up in the quarter. And so we see it. It's still a market that's driven by mitrals
more than tricuspid. So I don't know if that's helpful.

Lawrence H. Biegelsen
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

So that's very helpful. I mean, I guess I'd love to hear how you're thinking about that business beyond
2021. I mean $80 million to $100 million is a pretty big pickup from what you did in 2020. How do you
think about that business going forward?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Larry. Yes, when we said $80 million at the beginning of the year, that was about a doubling
from last year. So now we think it will more than double. But I think you know about how we feel about
this market. We formed a business unit around it and have an awful lot of really important differentiated
innovations going on in this space. So we have a high confidence level this is going to be important.

It's a road. We're very focused on making sure that we have great outcomes. And that's key to us. We
work on having rigorous pivotal trials. We have differentiated therapies, and we work on having great
real-world outcomes with our high-touch model. We've said that we think it's going to be more than $3
billion by 2025, so it gives you a signal as to what we think where the market is maybe $1 billion in that
neighborhood today.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes, nice quarter. Maybe I could start some P&L questions. Scott, gross margin was a touch light in the
quarter. Just maybe walk us through how you get back up to the 76%, 77% guidance through the back
part of the year. What gives you the confidence?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Well, it was a touch light, but keep in mind, there were a couple of moving pieces. One was we had
about 180 basis point hit from foreign exchange, primarily due to these hedge contracts where there are
downsides and it works opposite of the benefit that we get with the translation of sales from outside of
the U.S. But that was more than swamped by 230 basis points from manufacturing efficiencies and lower
special COVID expenses than what we had in the second quarter.

So you've got FX and manufacturing efficiencies at play, and we came in 10 basis points short of the
bottom end of our range for the full year gross margin guidance. We're probably, right now, looking at
something that is closer to the lower end of the 76% to 77% range, but it's probably too early to get more
granular than that, Robbie.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And while we're on the P&L, I'll use another here. The accounting charge that was a benefit this
quarter, I didn't hear what it was related to. If you don't mind, just what it's -- letting us know what it's
tied to, appreciate it.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Sure. Sure. So it was accounting adjustments that were associated with some lower expectations
of making future milestone payments connected to some past acquisitions that we've done. So the
accounting associated with those is we evaluate the probabilities and the timing and the assumptions
around whether we might make those milestone payments. And in this case, we think there's some lower
likelihood of some of those, and so we run it through as a non -- or as a GAAP gain but not something that
shows up in our non-GAAP earnings per share.

Robert Justin Marcus
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Is there any specific deals you can talk to? Or is it just the overall portfolio?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Well, there are 2 primary deals where we have earn-outs. One is Valtech, which is the parent company of
the Cardioband product, and the other is Harpoon. And I won't get into the details beyond that, but those
are the 2 big deals where we've got exposure to future milestones and where the expectations for those
move up and move down over time and we run those accounting results through the P&L.

Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering

Chairman & CEO

Yes, thanks. We feel like this quarter, we saw broad growth across all size centers. And so I think that's
most noteworthy, maybe even more than we have seen in the past, real strength from some of the big
centers. We continue to add centers this quarter. I would say it was kind of a normal addition, kind of what
we've been adding right along. We're probably at an 800-plus level in terms of centers right now. And so
that's going to be probably a diminishing important, but the ones we're adding now are quite small centers
and don't really have material impact to our results.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And a question for you on margins. Like we've been talking about investments in both clinical
trials and field teams or for this year, but it looks as though you're increasing those investments. I'm just
curious sort of what's changed in the last 90 days to increase those investments.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

You're talking about clinical trials?

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

Yes.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Yes.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

So we've got multiple pivotals underway right now, 5 in TMTT and then we've got other ones in TAVR and
surgical. And as we continue to enroll patients, those clinical trial expenses increase. Keep in mind, we
incur expenses at [ 2.1 ] at the point of treatment, but then secondly, we follow these patients a lot of
times out to 10 years. And so we've got this increasing and recurring clinical expense that is part of our
strategy. We're trying to build a robust body of clinical evidence, and it's an important part of how we're
intending to grow the top line over time.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And I'd add, Pito, although things definitely picked up in Q2 in terms of clinical trial activity, it could
go even faster yet in the future. And so that's what we anticipate.

Operator

Our next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So maybe a follow-up to Pito's question there on centers. I noticed that TVT, some of the information you
had up around the meeting included some comments on the number of interventional centers around the
world -- around the country that had TAVR -- that were also performing TAVR. And the reason I ask is
that, in the past, you've talked about this sneaking up on maybe 850 centers in the U.S. and not really
going to go to 1,100, 1,200 centers as we have for cardiac surgery. But the sort of -- comparing the
number of centers that are doing stenting but not TAVR seems a little bit like a new way of highlighting the
underpenetrated nature of the adoption. I'm just wondering if you could speak a little bit about that if I'm
reading that right or where you are exactly in that curve. And then I have one follow-up.

EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, I'm sorry if we weren't clear on that. I mean we have been, I think, pretty
consistent since the new NCD was approved a few years ago that we thought this was going to head
toward around 850 centers. That continues to be our belief. Nothing has really changed in that regard.
And it's probably constrained by the way that the NCD is written.

We'd probably argue that it might have been larger, but it is what it is. And so that's where it is. But what
I really wouldn't focus overly on number of centers, for example, in the U.S. when you think about what
the potential is for TAVR because the real issue is patients coming off the sidelines. There are many, many
patients with severe AS that, for, one reason or another, don't get diagnosed or don't ever make it to a
heart team and treatment. And that is going to be the key to the -- really the growth of TAVR overall.

And we're fortunate to have a great procedure that has terrific results, and we're making progress on
encouraging patients to come back. Now it's a challenge, obviously, with COVID because those same
patients that are vulnerable to COVID are those that are -- have very similar characteristics to severe AS
patients, but it's a real opportunity.

And the other thing that we find is there's much conversation about health disparities these days. That's
true in spades for severe aortic stenosis patients. There are real health disparities. And so as the overall
system looks to tackle that, we think that's a bit of a tailwind to our efforts.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Excellent. And just -- you mentioned that you're growing at a similar pace to the volumes in the various
regions that you're -- where you're operating. And any thoughts or contemplation of share easing or share
loss? You've had some significant gains in the past 1.5 years for a variety of reasons. And so anything
changing in that on the share front?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So we're -- that's always very difficult to measure at this point in time, and that's one that you get
a chance to look back on after everyone's reported and you get a chance to see the TVT Registry. It's not
truly our key focus. Most of our growth really comes from these patients coming into the system rather
than any sort of changes in share. But as we state, we really think that those were -- physicians were
stable in the quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley.

Cecilia E. Furlong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Mike, I wanted to start with TMTT in Europe and just really what you were able to do in 2Q in terms of
being able to access new sites to open new sites. And then as you contemplate the 80 to 100 for the year,
what's factored in from a new site opening versus just continued penetration in your existing sites?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It is a key part of our growth strategies. So that's a correct observation. We have been involved in a
lot of physician training. We have a high-touch model, so we're there, and we really help make sure that
when people start up, they start up the right way.

I think at this point, we're in double-digit countries, more than 10 countries across Europe, and we're
opening centers in all those places, and so a significant increase to our team and, of course, a lot of rigor
in terms of trying to back that up.

Cecilia E. Furlong
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Great. And just on Japan as well, off of the recent traction, as you're thinking about reimbursement
heading into '22, just the growth drivers you've seen recently but how you're thinking about really opening
new centers in that region going forward in '22, and new centers really being the growth driver as you
look forward over the next few years?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks. Yes, I think we talk about it. Every time that we're speaking to you that there is a really
significant undertreatment in Japan. They've got such a large elderly population that their treatment rates
should be much higher. And there are a number of structural issues that stand in the way of Japan getting
that done, and we try and become students of that, and we're making some progress.

Adding new centers is important and valuable. One of the things that I think may not be clear to most is
we've only had a high surgical risk indication up until now. And so we're going to jump to a low surgical
risk indication. And once that reimbursement comes in place, which happens this quarter, or we expect
to happen this quarter, that's when there should be some real reaction from clinicians in terms of treating
these patients. So we look forward to adding these new centers and -- but we're also mindful of just
COVID in Japan. So it's one we're very positive about in the long term, but a little uncertain in the short
term.

Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Barclays.

Travis Lee Steed
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I guess one longer-term question on margins. You're spending a lot today on R&D and SG&A but also
have a lot of investments in front of you. So just curious how you think, longer term, how you balance the
spending versus margin expansion.

Scott B. Ullem
Corporate VP & CFO

So yes, longer term, we do think we're going to continue to get some benefits from scale. And we think
about margins, I guess, in all 3 areas: gross margin, R&D, SG&A. On the gross margin line, you've seen us
expand gross margins. And even as we've invested a lot into our physical footprint of production facilities
around the world, we're getting more and more efficient as our volumes increase. And so that's going to
continue to be helpful, I think.

On the R&D side, we're going to continue to invest heavily. And that may not in the short term be a source
for additional leverage. But longer term, we do think revenues are going to outpace operating expenses,
including SG&A, where we're getting more benefits of scale. Our administrative, some of our back-office
functions can support a bigger business around the globe. And so we think we've got opportunities to,
over time, incrementally expand the operating margin.

Travis Lee Steed
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

All right. That's helpful. On the international business, I don't know if you've mentioned any update on
China and how that's going. I noticed Medtronic followed a study today and TAVR for their device in China.
So curious if there's any update on China. And are you looking at other markets to move into as well

did very nicely in critical care and surgical heart valves. But we're still launching there. We've got a very
deliberate and methodical approach that's aimed at having great patient outcomes. And so we're going to
be looking at this as a long-term opportunity in an intermediate and the long-term opportunity. Then we're
going to try and take it from that perspective. It doesn't help right now that some of us can't travel to
China. And so those kind of things tend to be obstacles, but overall, that team that's out there executing.

Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen.

Joshua Thomas Jennings
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Mike, I was hoping to, to just start, get a better understanding of your comments around patient backlog
in TAVR. Our checks with some physician experts are anecdotal, but they're relaying that when they query
their patients, most of their patients, they -- one even said at a high line center, they can't find a patient
that's saying that they delayed their procedure because of COVID. And so is your backlog, when you talk
about primary care physician offices, is this just the incidents in 2020, the patients that just were not
diagnosed are now coming back through the channel, and there are just more patients with aortic stenosis
that have not been diagnosed yet and are getting diagnosed whether primary care physicians or general
cardiologist and then moving through the channel? Is that the primary thrust of your backlog comments?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

We think so. At the risk of oversimplifying, yes, indeed, we believe that during COVID, people were more
fearful of COVID and entering the system with COVID than they were concerned about their AS, in many
cases. We even had some clinicians tell us that when patients are home and they're not very active, they
may not even demonstrate some of the symptoms they might have if they were more active. But we do
hear that they're coming back now.

It's been, again, anecdotal, so I'm a little hesitant to say that we know exactly where that's coming from,
Josh. So for example, we had one physician at a leading center that tells me thinks that the patients that
are coming back now were sicker than they were before, and that will show up in the numbers. But again,
totally anecdotal. But we've heard enough of this that we believe that there are patients that are coming
back into the system. And we saw the -- kind of a surge in the second quarter.

Joshua Thomas Jennings
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And maybe just one quick follow-up on a similar topic. There's stronger adoption of handheld ultrasound
technologies, more technologies coming into play. Are there any enabling technologies that will enhance
or accelerate the diagnosis of these undiagnosed aortic stenosis patients in the primary care office or the
general cardiologist office that's giving you some optimism about deeper penetration of TAVR as we move
forward here?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thank you. We think there's a host of technologies that are still pretty early, and we've been backers
of some of these that could really help with the diagnosis of valvular disease. There's -- it comes from
many directions, and we think, as the world digitizes and there's more handheld devices and there's more
ability to bounce signals off the cloud, whether it's EKGs or stethoscopes and handheld devices of all
sorts, especially those that can listen to heart sounds, that this is going to be enhanced. I'll avoid doing a
commercial for any particular companies, but there are numbers that are pursuing this exact thing. And
we think it's a very helpful sort of mega trend for us.

Anthony Charles Petrone
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Greg, congrats on the quarter. I hope everyone's well. Two quick ones. One would be just on the
competitive dynamics in Europe, in particular, and just maybe a quick update on the pricing dynamics
there, just given that the environment is a little bit more richer with competitors in that region of the
world. And then the second would be, on the $7 billion global TAVR outlook, that figure has not factored
in any symptomatic. So just wondering, taking the temperature here on asymptomatic, latest thoughts on
size of that opportunity and how that market opportunity can be untapped, over time.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks. Well -- and I'm sure that everybody, Anthony, gets a chance to track what's going on with
the various companies that are engaged in TAVR. In general, in Europe, there's a pretty full complement of
competitors. It seems to us that the 2 leading companies probably account to close to 85% of the volume
in Europe. So it gives you a bit of a sense. I don't know if that's exactly helpful for what you're looking for.
Was there more?

Let's see the $7 billion opportunity. You're right. It has very little asymptomatic in it. We have a big early
TAVR trial that's going on right now. And you also heard that we initiated a trial of patients with moderate
AS. Those are not in that number. So I tried to cover it in our general remarks. The $7 billion in 2025, we
don't see it as sort of top of some curve. This has the potential to grow significantly more, particularly if
we can demonstrate the value of TAVR for these patients that today have -- are not really indicated, and
we think these trials have the potential to do that.

Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVLeerink.

Danielle Joy Antalffy
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a good quarter. Just a follow-up to Josh's question on the backlog. I guess, Mike, I'm just
curious. Previously, you talked about this not being a backlog type of market given the high mortality rate
for these patients if they don't get treated. So I guess I'm curious about the increased level of confidence
that there is a backlog, first of all. And second of all, is it really about low-risk patients? Are you -- do you
have a sense of whether you're treating a higher percentage of low-risk patients right now? Any color you
can give on the patient mix that gives you conviction that this is a backlog work down strong underlying
volume.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Sure. And again, Danielle, we're trying to share with you our best thinking of what we believe. We believe
that this occurred upstream, part of what -- which was driving our comments in the past. And you're
exactly right. We've said, hey, AS patients don't store very well, and we think that's true. But remember,
we said there were 10,000 patients treated in -- I mean, 20,000 patients treated in Q2 and 30,000 this
Q2, so a big difference. And so it's not as though all of those 10,000 patients all come. It doesn't take very
many to move numbers like they moved in Q2.

So we believe that it's patients across all risk levels. Even -- I think people sometimes don't understand
that low-risk patients are quite old in many cases, and so it's not just simply the newer indication. It's
broadly that these patients that were elderly and had risk of COVID were hesitant to enter the system. We
believe that they were more likely, when signs of optimism really reached their peak in the second quarter,
to reenter the system and be treated, and that we got some lift out of that. We don't have perfect visibility
on that, so I can't be more quantitative.

Okay. And then you touched on this a little bit earlier, but there's a lot of overlap between the patients you
guys are treating in many of these studies and those that were most impacted by COVID. Do you have
any concern about COVID introducing noise into these studies that could complicate interpretation of the
data down the road? Just curious how you're thinking about that, if you're doing anything to try and head
that off.

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes, Chris, that's an astute observation. Yes, we are concerned about that, especially those studies where
rehospitalization or hospitalization is measured as an indicator in both the control group and the test
group. Those things can definitely get affected by -- during a moment like a COVID outbreak.

So it is of concern. It's very much on FDA's radar screen, and I'm sure all companies that do trials that
have those sort of end points. Our PIs are all about it. And then the good news is between our principal
investigators and the FDA, people are cognizant of it and are working together to try and deal with those
variabilities.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Congrats on the quarter. I did just want to see if I could get more specificity from you on the regions that
you're operating in that aren't doing so well. You mentioned there's some in Europe and some concerns
in Japan and APAC. I just want to think about how we should view them improving or getting worse in Q3
versus Q2. Could you give us any insight into that?

Michael A. Mussallem
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean what happens is, to get really discrete and go country by country might be misleading
because then we would get into countries that are pretty small but might not make a difference. We tend
to look at it in terms of the U.S. in total, Europe in total, Japan as a region, and then the rest of the world.
When we look at each of those discretely, even though each one has its soft spots -- so for example, you
know very well where the soft spots are in the U.S. and the places that are vulnerable to low growth, but
the U.S. in total looks quite positive.

The same thing in Europe. There are countries, some of the Nordic countries, like we can -- I could go
on to a greater level of specifics, that are struggling more. But overall, Europe is doing pretty well. They
performed at a high level in the second quarter.

Japan, in a lockdown, but then at the same time, they have the approval for low risk and we do have
optimism about the future. So each of these is positive. And even the rest of the world has put up very
nice growth. So we don't have a hotspot that probably affects a major region more. Those are going to be
smaller in their nature, if that makes sense, Matt.
