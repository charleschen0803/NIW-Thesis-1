Presentation

Operator

Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates Fourth Quarter Fiscal
Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is
being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Williams, Chief Financial Officer.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Liz. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates Fourth Quarter
and Fiscal 2021 Year-End Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. And on the call with me
today is David Foss, our Board Chair, President and CEO.

In just a minute, I'll turn the call over to Dave to provide some of his thoughts about the state of our
business, financial and sales performance for the quarter, some comments regarding the industry in
general, and then some other key initiatives that we have in place. Then after Dave concludes his
comments, I will provide some additional thoughts and comments regarding the earnings press release
we put out yesterday after market close, and provide comments regarding our guidance for our fiscal year
2022 provided in the release, and then we will open the lines up for Q&A.

First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks
or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or
results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause
actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and
uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary
of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections
in our 10-K, entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements. Also on this call, we will be discussing
certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The
reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found in yesterday's press release.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave.

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are very pleased to share details with you of a
quarter that produced record revenue and operating income as well as record sales bookings.

As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that
went into producing those results for our fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year, particularly in light of
the challenges posed by conducting business while dealing with the ongoing effects of the pandemic.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, total revenue increased 10% for the quarter and increased 10% on a
non-GAAP basis. Deconversion fees were essentially flat as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to
the segments. We had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 4% for
the quarter and increased by 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payment segment performed extremely well,
posting a 16% increase in revenue this quarter and a 17% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had a
strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and
a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

As I highlighted in our press release, the fourth quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history
of the company. June was also the strongest sales month ever, and have propelled all 3 sales groups to
exceed their quota for the quarter. While they were signing all those contracts in the fourth quarter, the
sales team also did an outstanding job of refilling the pipeline with new opportunities to set us up for

success going forward. I think this is a good sign of the health of our market, and bodes well for the start
of the new sales year.

In the fourth fiscal quarter, we booked 13 competitive core takeaways and 14 deals to move existing
on-premise customers to our private cloud environment. Several of our complementary offerings also
saw a very strong demand in the quarter with, as you might guess, our digital suite leading the pack.
We signed 87 new clients to our Banno digital platform in the quarter, 10 new treasury management
clients and 22 new clients to our card processing solution. For the full year, we signed 41 competitive core
takeaways, with 8 of them greater than $1 billion in assets. Additionally, we signed 35 contracts to move
on-prem core clients to our private cloud, 219 new Banno digital customers and 55 new clients for our
card processing solution. Of course, we signed a variety of other contracts for many of our other solutions
as well, but it's important to note that almost all of these contracts represent long-term recurring revenue
commitments to Jack Henry for a wide variety of our solutions.

At our analyst conference in May, I shared with the attendees that we had just surpassed 5 million
registered users on our Banno Digital Banking platform. As of the end of the fiscal year, we were at
roughly 5.6 million registered users. As a point of reference, on July 1, 2020, we had about 3.2 million
registered users. So in 1 year, we saw an increase of approximately 75% in our user count. This is
significant because, as I have stressed in the past, most of the revenue for a business like this is tied to
the number of users on the platform. We continue to onboard clients and their users at a pace of about 30
financial institutions added to the platform each month.

In addition to our ongoing success with Banno, we have delivered many new and innovative solutions
during the fiscal year. A few examples include our Symitar team delivered an automated database
migration to almost all of our Episys clients, which allowed them to move to the new database structure
with no effort or client impact. Our lending team delivered the Jack Henry Loan Marketplace, which
allows banks and credit unions to easily engage through a digital experience in the buying, selling and
participation of loans. Our digital team delivered the Banno Digital Toolkit, which provides a complete
set of application programming interfaces, or APIs, to enable easy plug-ins to third-party solutions in
our digital platform. Our payments team continued the expansion of functionality and adoption of the
PayCenter platform and delivered the Zelle digital tool to enable clients not using our digital platform to
connect to the PayCenter hub for Zelle transactions. And of course, the payments group completed the
3.5-year project to upgrade our card payments platform. Almost all of these new deliverables are built on
entirely new technology stacks and are designed to make it easier for our customers to leverage our open
architecture tools and philosophy to deliver cutting-edge solutions to their account holders.

As you may know, we have a number of active projects at Jack Henry centered on the topic of corporate
responsibility. We continue to advance our environmental stewardship commitment and recently
announced that on Earth Day, our associates launched a new business innovation group called Bill
Green. Our business innovation groups are company-sponsored, associate-driven groups that provide a
collaborative platform for people, ideas and thoughts to intersect and help address business challenges.
Our associates decided that a business innovation group focused on our planet was appropriate and
necessary for us to make meaningful progress on this initiative.

As the labor market continues to heat up, we are focused more than ever on attracting and retaining
talented associates. To that end, we have recently implemented new technology to expand our remote
recruiting efforts and broaden our pool of qualified and diverse talent. Our hope is that this approach will
only serve to improve on the reputation as a great place to work that we currently enjoy in cities across
the country. Our consistent placement on Best Places to Work list is a testament to the workplace culture
we have at Jack Henry, and our employee engagement scores reflect that strong culture. I'm pleased
to share that nearly 2/3 of our associates participated in our most recent engagement survey, and our
average engagement score was 83%, well above the industry benchmark.

Like most employers, we have spent a good bit of time in the past few weeks wrestling with decisions
around the right timing and approach to move employees back to work in our company facilities. We
worked with our leadership teams earlier in the calendar year and determined that more than half of our
workforce would continue to work remote indefinitely. We had targeted July 1 as our return to office date

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2021

for those who would be earning in a full-time or hybrid basis. As the Delta variants surged, we reverted to
our previous operating model with only essential employees in our offices every day.

We have proven that we can operate effectively in a remote posture, and we will continue in that mode
until we determine it is safe to make a change. As I referenced on the last earnings call, our longtime
Chairman, Jack Prim, has retired as of the end of June. Jack had been with our company for many years
in various leadership roles and as a Board member and Chairman. As a result of Jack's retirement, we
have announced 2 changes to the Board. Curtis Campbell has joined the Board effective July 1 to fill
the seat left vacant by Jack's departure. Curtis is President of Software for Blucora in Dallas. He brings
extensive experience in infrastructure and cloud computing as well as digital development and a keen
focus on customer experience. I'm very excited to see what new perspectives Curtis brings to our Board
discussions.

Also effective July 1, I was elected to be the new Board Chair. I was humbled and honored by the
confidence expressed by the other Board members, and I look forward to leading the Jack Henry Board
to even greater success. As I reflect back on fiscal 2021, I can confidently say it was a very good year
for our company. Our employee engagement scores remained very high, and we've made great strides
with our diversity and inclusion initiatives. Our levels of customer engagement and customer satisfaction
scores are also very high. We have successfully completed several leadership and Board level retirements
and replacements. Our sales teams are performing extremely well and have positioned us for another
successful year of selling. And overall demand for Jack Henry technology solutions remains high in all
segments of our business.

We have a commitment to doing the right thing for our constituents that we believe will continue to serve
us well. We will continue with our disciplined approach to running the company, and expect that approach
to help provide stability for our employees, customers and shareholders. As we begin the new fiscal year, I
continue to be very optimistic about the future.

With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Dave. Our services and support revenue -- line of revenue increased 6% in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. As Dave mentioned, our deconversion fees for
the quarter were pretty flat with last year's fourth quarter. However, for the full year, our deconversion
fees were down $33.3 million for the full fiscal year compared to the prior year, which is actually the
guidance that we provided a year ago on this call. Our service support revenue primary driver was our
data processing and hosting fees in our private cloud and public cloud offerings, which continued to show
strong growth in the quarter compared to the previous year, growing by 7% for the quarter.

However, the growth in this line is slowed significantly due to product delivery and service revenue,
which includes deconversion fees, license, hardware, implementation and convert merge revenue, which
only grew 2% compared to the prior year quarter, which this line is obviously somewhat impacted by
COVID. Our processing revenue increased 15% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the same
quarter last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by our higher card volumes from new customers
installed last year and increased debit card and credit card usage from existing customers. Our Jack Henry
digital revenue continues to grow -- show very strong growth as demand for our Banno digital platform
continues to be very strong, as Dave highlighted.

Our total revenue was up 10% for the quarter compared to last year, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
So excluding deconversion fees and divestitures, our non-GAAP grew 10% as well. For the full fiscal year,
revenue was up 4% on a GAAP basis and 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Again, excluding deconversion fees
and revenues from divestitures.

Our cost to revenue was up 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter, the increase primarily due to
higher costs associated with our card processing and higher personnel costs compared to a year ago. Our
research and development expense decreased 4% for the quarter of fiscal '21 over the prior year quarter.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2021

The decrease was due primarily to a slightly higher percentage of costs being capitalized for product
development this quarter compared to a year ago.

Our SG&A expense increased 3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to the same quarter in the
prior fiscal year. The increase is due primarily to increased personnel and professional services costs. Our
reported consolidated operating margins increased nicely from 18.7% last year to 21.4% in the current
year quarter. And on a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins expanded from 17.8% last year to 20.1%
this year.

Our Payments segment saw the nicest margin expansion in the quarter. After completing the payment
platform migration in Q3, margins grew from 43% last year to 45% this year on the fourth quarter on
a GAAP basis. And on a non-GAAP basis, our payments segment margins grew from 42.3 to 44.5, so
over 200 bps margin expansion. Our core segment operating margins decreased slightly during the
quarter compared to last year on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, while our company segment margins
increased slightly on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of
fiscal '21 was down slightly to 19.7% compared to 20% in the same quarter a year ago, primarily due
to some tax -- state tax deductibility timing. Our net income grew 25% to $76.9 million for the fourth
fiscal quarter compared to $61.3 million last year, with earnings per share of $1.04 for the current quarter
compared to $0.80 last year or a $0.24 or 30% increase over the prior year.

Our cash flow total amortization increased 3% for the fiscal year compared to last year, primarily due
to capitalized projects being placed into service last year. Included in the total amortization is the
amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $17.7 million this fiscal year
compared to $20.3 million last fiscal year. Depreciation was up slightly at less than 1% for the year
compared to the prior fiscal year.

During the year, we purchased 2.8 million shares of our [indiscernible] stock to the treasury for $431.5
million, and we paid dividends of $133.8 million for a total return to shareholders of $565.3 million for the
year. Our operating cash flow was $462.1 million for the year, which was down from $510.5 million last
fiscal year, which this decrease was primarily due to the timing of various operating assets and liabilities
and timing. We invested $157.8 million back intercompany through CapEx and capitalized software.

Our free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less CapEx, less cap software, and adding back net
proceeds from disposal of assets, was $310.5 million for the year, which represents a 99.7% net
income for free cash flow conversion. Yesterday's press release inadvertently omitted the proceeds from
dispositions line of net cash from investing activities within the cash flow summary. Amounts that should
have been included were cash inflows of $6.187 million in fiscal '21 and $11,130 million for fiscal 2020.
The totals for investing activities were correct. This omission was corrected in the version of the earnings
press release filed yesterday on Form 8-K and the one notated on our website.

Couple of comments on our balance sheet. Our cash position of $51 million compared to $213 million a
year ago, primarily down due to the significant stock repurchase we did. You'll remember at the end of Q3,
we had $200 million drawn down on our revolver. During Q4, we paid down $100 million of that balance.
So at June 30, we had $100 million on our revolver. We had no other long-term debt on our balance sheet
other than operating leases.

For the year, our return on average assets for the fiscal year was 13.1%. Our return on invested capital
for the fiscal year was 21%, and our return on equity for the year was 21.7%. Yesterday, we provided
both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance in the press release for fiscal 2022. We also provided a
reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP revenue guidance in the release following the segment information in
the press release.

Just to be clear, this guidance continues to assume that the country continues to open and the economy
continues to improve, but if things work differently than this, then guidance will be revised. For GAAP
revenue growth for fiscal '22, based on the amounts of the release yesterday, our revenue guidance is a
range of 8.2% to 8.7% growth over fiscal '21, due to higher anticipated deconversion fees compared to FY
'21. And for non-GAAP revenue growth, we are guiding to an initial range of 7.5% to 8% growth for the
fiscal year. Obviously, these will be updated during the year on future earnings calls.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2021

We do anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins to improve a little in FY '22 compared to last year
as we should have nice margin expansion in our payment segment and anticipate higher deconversion
fees. I am somewhat cautious on guiding to too much of an improvement in operating margin as we will
continue to have headwinds on license revenue as we continue to move core customers from on-prem to
our private cloud. Also, travel costs continued to increase significantly compared to the last year.

And at this time, we are still planning to host our Jack Henry Annual Conference and our Symitar EGI
Conference in person this year. Therefore, there will be some large cost returning this year compared
to last year, when there was very little travel. However, we do think that we will get at least 50 bps of
margin expansion in the fiscal year. Our effective tax rate for FY '22 is projected to be slightly higher at
approximately 22.5% to 23% compared to our actual rate this year of 21.7%. And this is primarily due
to the significant impact from equity awards that were deductible in FY '21. Our initial FY '22 GAAP EPS
guidance is a range of $453 million to $460 million, which is a 10%-plus increase from our FY '21 finish.
This concludes our opening comments, and we are now ready to take questions. Liz, will you please open
the lines up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vasu Govil with KBW.

Vasundhara Govil
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I wanted to congratulate David on becoming Chairman of the Board.

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Thank you, Vasu.

Vasundhara Govil
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

I guess just the first question to follow up on the margin commentary there that you provided, Kevin.
I know that previously you had indicated about 100 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal '22, and
potentially even some upside to that. Now you seem to be indicating 50 basis points. So I guess, just
wanted to understand what changed in your outlook versus what you were expecting before?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Well, I would tell you that the biggest change is the impact of COVID because obviously, we had some
really nice margin expansion this year with no travel-related costs. Obviously, there was also a decrease in
revenue from [ convert ] merge revenue and other things. So there's a lot of offsetting things out there.
And I mean, just to be clear, I feel like both our revenue -- GAAP or non-GAAP revenue growth of 7.5% to
8%, and our margin expansion of 50 bps are both conservative.

Vasundhara Govil
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Understood. And I guess the second question. I was just hoping if you could provide some color on
growth expectations by segment for fiscal '22, particularly what you're expecting for the core and payment
segments. I know with the core segment, do you expect sort of this improvement that we've seen on a
non-GAAP basis to kind of continue into next year? And then payment segment has already been quite
strong. I mean is there room for further acceleration as some of the new wins on the card payment side
start to flow in?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So I mean we saw some really nice margin expansion in the payments segment in Q4. We will see
more in FY '22. There is still additional costs that will be coming out by the end of the first half of fiscal '22
in the payment segment. So I think there will still be some really nice margin expansion. And as we add
additional customers, that will also expand the margins. And obviously, cards is still 60% of the payment
segment.

Operator

Our next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2021

In terms of thinking about the record sales in the fourth quarter, is there a way of thinking about total
bookings on like a TCV or ACV basis in terms of thinking about year-over-year increase? I think in the
prior year, you had 43 competitive core takeaways. Of course, not all financial institutions are equal,
wide variants and sizes. But given some of the difficulties over the last fiscal year, is there a worry about
thinking about the kind of percentage increase in overall bookings that might help us think about the
outlook?

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes, when you have a sales sense -- Dave, by the way, Pete. When you have a sales -- a sales quota, the
size of our sales quota, a percentage increase of more than 5% per year is a very significant increase. And
if I remember correctly, I don't think I have it exactly in front of me, but I think it was -- year-over-year,
it was about 7% or 8%, somewhere in that range year-over-year as far as sales bookings. We don't -- you
know this well, we don't publish a TCV number or anything like that. But it's -- that's a good way to think
about how we measure quota and how quotas are assigned. So you can kind of use that logic in making
some assumptions. So if we're 7% or 8%-ish increase over the prior year as far as sales performance,
that's a good way to think about it. Now the other thing I'll point out is when we assign quotas for next
year, meaning for the year we're in now, fiscal '22, we -- our starting point is last year's performance.
And then we normally apply somewhere between 3% and 5% quota increase over the top of what the
performance was last year. So that's where the sales team is starting out this year, is with a sales quota
that is somewhere in the 3% to 5% range, larger than it was their actual payment for the prior year.

Peter James Heckmann
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Got it. That is helpful. And then just thinking about the cadence of term fees, the guide for term fees. No
surprise with some of the uptick we've seen in M&A in the mid-tier space. But in terms of the cadence,
Kevin, would you specifically call out some level for the first quarter? Or when you might think those might
hit just in terms of trying to get the quarterly forecast correct?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Well, I mean, Pete, obviously, we've been hearing a lot about M&A activity, which obviously that's what
drives deconversion fees. We have not seen a lot of actual activity yet. So I think that's going to grow
over the years. So I have a feeling that the bulk of the deconversion fees are probably going to be in the
second half of the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Nice job. And I guess my first question, just when we think of kind of the wallet providers, that space,
there's a lot of investors that are just concerned that, that group is just going to take over the world
and all bank accounts will kind of move to that over time. But I guess a couple of things. Are you seeing
growth in your number of accounts? I don't know if you have some metrics on that in your total accounts?
But also, is there any reason that the banks can't do exactly the same thing and provide all the same
services, plus have FDIC insurance and all those things that make most consumers rather just have a
bank account over time?

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Okay. That's a very intuitive question, Dave. In fact, I'm presenting at a conference in, I think it's
February of next year on that very topic because bankers are starting to realize that if you have a good
digital platform on the front end, and if you take advantage of an open infrastructure like we have at Jack

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2021

Henry, and it's the reason we talk about it all the time, you can do, as a banker, essentially all those same
things and draw our customers to your platform as a bank with the FDIC insurance backing it. And there's
a real opportunity for bankers to take advantage of this desire and demand among consumers today for
solutions like that.

So we are doing that today with a number of banks, but part of the channel or part of the process for
me is to educate bankers on what they can do, what they should be thinking about, how they compete
in those areas. So lots of opportunity for our customers and for Jack Henry, but it's based on a really
outstanding digital platform and then having all the connectivity to connect those types of fintech
functions into that digital platform. And we have all of those things in production today at Jack Henry.

This isn't a wish for the future, this is in production today with customers today. So a great opportunity.
And to the first part of your question about customer growth. So yes, we are able to measure customer
growth, whether it's members on the credit union platform or customers on the banking platforms. And
not only are we adding customers because we're winning share, we're winning new customers. So the
net number of customers we serve is greater. But because there is same-store sales growth happening,
particularly on the credit side of the business, it's happening on the banking side, but it's been strong on
the credit union side of the business as well.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's good to hear. And then maybe secondly, growth in payments, obviously, really good. I
assume that's debit transaction growth just off of a pretty low base. But how do we -- how do you expect
that to grow through the year? I would think Q1 would still be pretty high off kind of easier comps, and
then maybe the rest of the year a little below double digits or something? Like do you have any sort of
cadence for that?

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

I think that's a good expectation. The other thing I'll highlight is we talk -- and Kevin emphasized that
60% of our payments business is on the cards platform. But don't forget about the business we refer to
as EPS, enterprise payment solutions. That's our merchant -- our remote fast capture and mobile capture
business. That business has been growing nicely as well. So it's a much smaller piece of the segment
that's growing rapidly. And I think you're going to continue to hear more about that business at Jack
Henry as well.

So both of those, too, and I've said it on many earnings calls, the bill pay business, relatively flat for
everybody. There's not a whole lot of new stuff happening in traditional bill pay. But the card growth that
you've seen, I think under -- or in the high single digit is a good expectation for the card growth, but it will
be greater than that for the EPS business as far as what we're seeing right now because of the strength of
that platform.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

And Dave, remember, it's not just debit. We now offer full service credit as well because we could not offer
that before we got moved over to the new platform. So our full-service credit is growing basically from a
base of 0.

Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.

Kartik Mehta
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Kevin, I just wanted to ask a little bit about the credit card platform conversion. It looks like that's going
well. And you talked about a little bit more cost coming out of the payments business. I'm wondering, in

relationship to what you anticipated for cost savings out of the platform, would you have achieved that or
exceeded that? How would you characterize the cost savings from your platform?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Okay. So Kartik, we completed the migration in Q3. So we had all customers on the new platform. And in
-- sometime in April, we started decommissioning the 4 mainframes that supported the 2 platforms that
we used to have. And I think those got completely decommissioned, I believe, by mid-July, if I remember
right. But there are some other things that's going on here, Kartik. So there were some other tools that
we have to keep the talent on to rewrite and get some additional tools in place, which that will be done by
the end of Q2. And so you'll see some additional costs coming out by then. So by Q3 of this year, we will
see the full benefit of the cost takeout that we guided to 3 years ago.

Kartik Mehta
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Perfect. And Dave, I think you've talked about maybe core demand now increasing as people kind of
realize that COVID is still going on and some of the decisions they didn't make they're making. How would
you characterize core demand today? Is it increasing? Or is it kind of back to normal?

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

I would say that it's back to normal. So normal for Jack Henry. So pre-pandemic, we were running at
about 1 new competitive replacement per week. We are back to that level now. We did 15 last quarter. We
did 13 this quarter. Everything that I'm seeing now would indicate that, that's a pace that we can run at
for a while. It's -- but it's definitely leading the industry by far as new core replacements, and that looks
sustainable for us now.

Kartik Mehta
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Perfect. And just one last question. Have you seen any change in the competitive nature for these core
renewals, maybe as the market gets back to a little bit normal?

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

For core renewals, what -- we've talked about this in the past. Consultants are now engaged every time
there's a renewal. So 10 years ago, it was rare to have a consultant involved in a renewal. Today, every
single one of them has a consultant, and that's not just Jack Henry, it's in the industry. And how does the
consultant justify their role? It's by ensuring that it's a very competitive process. So that's been going
on. It started before the pandemic. It is definitely in place today, where every single renewal for all of us,
there is a consultant engaged. They're encouraging diligent review of pricing and all that kind of stuff. And
so we know how to operate in that model, and we're comfortable with what's happening.

Our next question comes from John Davis with Raymond James.

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Kevin, just a quick clarification around the margins. So you said 50 basis points. Just want to clarify, that's
on a non-GAAP basis throughout expansion?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Correct.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2021

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

And then a follow-up there. I think our math suggests that the payments platform migration would be
about a 50 basis point benefit this year. So is the right way to think about it, that incremental travel
and other expenses kind of offset normal operating leverage with maybe a little bit of upside in your
conservative comments?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. And then John, I saw in your note about the EPS and your calculation on margins. You also have to
remember that our effective tax rate is going to go up from 21.7% to 22.5% to 23%, too. So if you're just
looking at EPS, that's also going to have a slight negative impact, but we're still guiding EPS to grow more
than 10%.

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then you guys are guiding deconversion fees of about 70% year-over-year. Is that the right
way to think about the increase and convert merger revenue? And then any way you guys can give us an
idea of what percentage of a normal year convert merger revenue as a percentage of your core segment
revenue? Just trying to understand because I think that was one of the areas that was a little bit weaker
than you expected this year. And just how we should think about that bounce back coming in '22?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. There was a significant headwind from convert merger revenue being down because there's no
M&A activity. And you're absolutely right. I mean if deconversion revenue does tick up like we think, our
customers will be buying just as much as our customers getting acquired. So not only would it increase
convert merger revenue, but also increase build travel because we'll have more people traveling out to
do those convert mergers. As a percentage of total revenue, on the top of my head, John, I can't -- I
mean it's not a huge number, but when you start talking several million dollars in convert merge revenue
that we basically build full boat for those, so it's a very nice margin business. It's actually the highest
implementation margins we have. So not only does it help reduce the headwinds on revenue, but it also
helps our overall operating margin.

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

And I will chime in here, John, on that topic. We -- one of the things that is interesting in this business is
when an existing customer is looking at acquiring another institution, whether it's a bank or credit union,
we have a lot of visibility into that because they will contact us to say we're working on this deal. We may
not consummate the deal, but we're working on it. We want to make sure that we have a conversion slot
available. We have time on the Jack Henry calendar because we want to be able to do that as quickly after
we close the deal as possible.

So we have a good deal of visibility into the activity that's happening out there in the converted merger
space. And I can tell you right now, there is a lot of activity. So there's a lot in the press about M&A
activity coming back, and we're certainly seeing it in the number of our customers who are coming to us
saying, we're looking at acquiring another institution. We want to make sure you guys are ready to help
us. So we can't exactly predict when those things are going to happen, but the activity levels are definitely
back.

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then last one for me. Kevin, anything to call out from sequential cadence this year on the
revenue side or margins? Or should we just basically kind of look at 2 years to your CAGRs on the top

line? And maybe remind us when your in-person conferences are in those expenses, which quarters those
will be in?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So John, it's a good question. And actually, I thought about that as I was driving over here for this
meeting this morning. Cadence, the one thing I'd say is we've now been on ASC 606 now for 4 years.
So the cadence of growth is going to kind of be the same. Q1 should be really strong because of all the
software subscription revenue that we take the first of that quarter. It obviously gets a little weaker in Q2,
and then just grows in Q3 and Q4 from there. And as far as our user conference here, actually a combined
conference this year. Well, they're not really combined, they kind of overlap, and those are scheduled to
be in October. So that will hit Q2.

Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer.

Dominick Joseph Gabriele
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Does the sales pipeline being just so much better, 7% to 8% versus your quarter -- your quota rather, of
typically a raise of 3% to 5%. Maybe you could talk about what's filling that gap? Is it a few large clients
that you've won that have kind of raised that? Or is it perhaps some pent-up demand that's coming in
recently that was lagging previously? Maybe you could walk us through the puts and takes of why you're
-- it's just pure execution? Anything you could provide there, I'd really appreciate it.

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Sure. And just to be clear, Dominick. So when I was referring to the 7% to 8%, I was talking about actual
performance over prior year. So pipeline, just so we're all clear on terminology, when I talk pipeline, I'm
talking about the opportunities that we're working currently that may close in the future as opposed to
quota attainment is things that have been booked in the past, and are deals that have already been signed
with our customers. But to answer the specifics of your question, no, this is not just a few large clients or
something like that. This is a broad suite of solutions that we've been selling to a broad list of customers.
Of course, the core success that we've had this year was significant. And so that's a driver.

I highlighted in my opening comments, the number of Banno customers that we signed this year. So 219
brand-new Banno digital customers. That is becoming an important driver for us as we go forward. But
then it's all these other solutions, the treasury management and all the customers that we signed for our
payments platforms, including, like I mentioned in my response to Dave Koning's question earlier. Our
EPS platform, which we're seeing some nice interest in that as a payments platform for customers going
forward.

So it's just a broad variety of solutions. So the point about pent-up demand, and that's a little bit of a
tough one because we saw -- sales was lumpier during the height of COVID. But we didn't see -- when
you look at it over the 12-month period, we didn't see sales slow down, but it was very lumpy. So I have
trouble characterizing it as pent-up demand because the sales happened. They were just not quite a
smooth we're normally accustomed to. So I think it's interest in Jack Henry. It's customers coming to Jack
Henry, who just haven't done business with us before, and it's because of this broad suite of solutions that
we have and all of the new technology that we delivered.

So I highlighted in my opening comments, the work that our Symitar team did around database migration
and delivering an entirely new database, the lending team with all the new functionality that we've
delivered there this year, the digital team that I've already highlighted. The payments -- PayCenter
platform that I talked about in my opening comments, where we now enable all these real-time payments
through a brand-new ground-up payments platform. So it's a variety of different things that, add them all
together, and it was just a really successful sales year.

Dominick Joseph Gabriele
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

There's definitely no question argument with the awesome sales wins -- numbers. And then maybe just
one more. When you talk about the revenue margin guidance being conservative, can you maybe walk
through some of the puts and takes of that commentary? And you went over this a little bit. But when you
think about beating the 50 basis points margin expansion, does that really coincide with you beating your
revenue guidance? And perhaps what kind of investments do you think you could look -- you could see
where even if you beat on the revenue guidance, there's some additional investments you'd like to make
that might just keep you around that 50 basis points overall for margin expansion for the year?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

So that's a good question. So to beat the guidance we gave for non-GAAP revenue, it would mean that
we would have some continued implementation of movements from some of our card customers. So
move some large debit customers over the continued success in our credit card platform processing. M&A
activity, which would drive the convert merge revenue and billable travel that we talked about earlier, and
then just implementing. And then obviously, the continued movement of moving our on-prem customers
into our private cloud also helps our margins.

So there's several different drivers that could cause us to beat that non-GAAP revenue guidance. And from
what I'm seeing, I think that's probably going to happen, but I'm not willing to step down that limit and
say how much at this point. And every one of those things that I just mentioned can also help to improve
margin.

As far as investments, I mean we just finished our budget. And I don't know that -- even if we beat
revenue guidance, I don't know that there's any big investments out there that we need to make that
we're not already making either from a cap software development or from CapEx that's not already in the
budget, which is part of that guidance.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research.

Kenneth Christopher Suchoski
Autonomous Research LLP

Dave and Kevin, I just wanted to ask about Banno, since you had some really strong results there. I
believe Banno is no longer restricted to the core base this year. So I was hoping you could talk about how
you expect Banno growth to trend now that, that offering is open to the rest of the market. And what's the
size of that business today? You mentioned, I think it was 5.6 million users. I mean what type of revenue
does Banno contribute?

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

So first off, just to be clear, Ken, what I've said is that we'll start selling Banno outside the base in
calendar 2022. So it's not this calendar year, it will be next year. This year, the major deliverable for the
Banno group is Banno business, which is the -- if you think about all the functionality we have on the
consumer side with Banno, in a couple of months here, we'll deliver all that same type functionality on the
business side of the solution. And then it will be next calendar year that we'll start delivering outside the
base.

But as I've stressed on these calls in the past, most banks and credit unions in the United States, I'm
not just talking about Jack Henry core customers, I'm talking in general, most of them have an Internet
banking offering and a mobile banking offering, and they are 2 different things, 2 different experiences.
Consumers don't want 2 different experiences anymore. They expect to have a single experience when
they go to access their information from their financial institution, and it doesn't matter what the form
factor is. If they're on a phone, on a tablet, on a PC, they expect to have the same experience. And so

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 18, 2021

that creates opportunity for us inside and outside our base. And so -- and that's not changing anytime
soon. There are thousands of institutions out there who will, over the next several years, upgrade their
digital experience, and we plan to be there with Banno outside the base next year.

As far as the size of the business, we don't call that out as a separate business. We have discussed at
some point, would we possibly do that as a segment, but we're not there yet. But it's -- the 5.6 million
users I've been asked on these calls before, there are some pure play offerings out there that you can
kind of do the math and figure out, based on their number of users, what the revenue per user is. Is that
transferable to Jack Henry? My answer is generally yes, that's transferable. So you can kind of figure out
how large the business is. The thing that I will stress is for that business, our digital business operates
under the same rules as our other businesses at Jack Henry, which means you don't get a pass on making
money. You have to produce operating income, operating results in addition to revenue growth. And
certainly, the Banno business is doing that for Jack Henry. So it's continuing to grow nicely. We'll continue
to grow nicely based on all the things we're seeing right now, the backlog of installs that we have right
now. And we'll continue to produce operating -- bottom line operating results for our company.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Just one more thing in there. So when we talk about digital, that's not just Banno. That includes a lot of
different things, which includes our predecessor, NetTeller solution, which we still have several hundred
FIs on our NetTeller solution and using our goDough mobile solution. And a lot of those will never move to
Banno. So -- but when we talk about digital, we're talking about all of that, and treasury, and Geezeo, and
Molson, which is open anywhere, which is some of the acquisitions we've done in the last 3 years. So the
term digital encompasses quite a few different products and offerings.

Kenneth Christopher Suchoski
Autonomous Research LLP

Yes, that's really helpful, very detailed answer there. I appreciate that. And I know you guys aren't giving
guidance for fiscal year '23, but just -- I mean there's a lot of moving parts with the margin in terms of
things opening up. You have the platform migration. But once that platform migration, I guess, is behind
you, what's the right way to think about margins or margin expansion after fiscal year '22? Just because
when I look at your numbers, I mean, Jack Henry had a, call it, roughly 24.5% operating margin in fiscal
year '17. I mean is that a good benchmark for fiscal year '23?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Well, it depends on which numbers you're looking at for 2017. If you're looking for the restated numbers
after ASC 606, if you're looking at the previous numbers because ASC 606 did have an impact on our
margins. But I would say that -- I'd answer it this way. I'm pretty comfortable that after we get through FY
'22, again, there's a lot of unknowns out there with COVID and other things. But I think starting in FY '23,
we can kind of go back to our normal 50 to 100 basis points expansion in our operating margin as we get
everything kind of put back in place this year.

Kenneth Christopher Suchoski
Autonomous Research LLP

Okay. That's really helpful. And then maybe my last question. Just -- I guess, as you think about new
sales and how they're expected to trend as the economy reopens, the pipeline is quite strong. Just curious
if you expect that to accelerate as you get back to seeing your customers in person?

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

Yes. I don't expect that you're going to see some great big pop in sales. I mean, as I said before, our
quota is a very large number today. And so if you're growing at 3% to 5% a year-over-year on a very
large sales number, that sets the company up pretty well because we're such a high concentration of

recurring revenue. So you assume that the recurring revenue is continuing to percolate and you're
layering revenue in on top of it and you're growing a sales quota at 3% to 5% per year over the prior year
performance. That's a pretty solid model. So I'm happy with that model. I don't expect that we're going to
see some great big pop in sales in the coming year. I think the performance will continue to be solid and
consistent.

Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.

Matthew Van Roswell
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

It's actually Matt Roswell sitting in for Dan. Just a quick question. With the payment platform conversion
done, are there any relying major solutions that need to be kind of replatformed onto the open
architecture? And then with, theoretically, all the solutions on an open architecture, do that change the
sort of accounting cadence between capitalization of software, timing or D&A or the income statement
components of CapEx?

David B. Foss
Chairman of the Board, CEO & President

So I'll take the first part of your question, and Kevin can address any of the hard financial questions, the
CFO stuff. So first off, we have about 300 different solutions. And so they are all in some stage of either
fully platformed on a complete open platformed or they're in the process or some is done. And there
are some that it isn't logical to take them to an open -- to a new architecture. We, for example, have a
payroll solution that it's been around for a long time. It was a successful product. Nobody is buying payroll
solutions from a provider like us anymore. We haven't sold a copy in 20 years. Why we put the effort into
replatforming that product?

So if you look at the broad suite of solutions that we offer, it isn't logical to try and move everything to
a new platform. But for all those that are the real high demand solutions, they've either been put into a
completely open environment or they're in process of offering that type of solution. And many have been
important to public cloud offerings. So we're in both Azure and AWS today with some of our solutions.
We have many in our private cloud. So it's just because of the broad suite of products that we have, it's
just kind of naturally a variety of different platforms that we offer them on. But for the kind of the key
solutions, they either are today supporting open connectivity, open infrastructure or we're well on our way
to doing that. I'll let you take the hard part, Kevin.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So the other part, Dan, is if you look at us for basically the last 10-plus years, I actually have a chart
that shows this, our total R&D spend for R&D expense on the P&L and cap software on the cash flow
statement has been 14% of revenue. So our total R&D spend has grown at almost the exact same pace as
our top line revenue for the last 10 years. I don't see that changing. I think we're going to continue that.
And I would tell you that the way -- we don't do really big bang productions.

I mean we do sprints and do try to get modules rolled out as quick as possible and do additional modules.
So there's no -- not going to see any huge increase in amortization of software in any given year. It's
just going to kind of slowly grow because at any given time, this is actually a chart I show the Board
every quarter. At any given time, about 85% or 86% of our total cap software on the balance sheet is in
production being amortized.

So -- and that hasn't changed for the last -- last few years either. So what that tells you is we're
continuing to develop all that software. We continue to roll it out. But at the same time, in 5 years, some
of the stuff in the amortization has done amortizing. So you got an offset there. So I don't think that we're
going to do anything crazy in the foreseeable future. There's going to have much of an impact on either
cash flow or the P&L, other than what you've seen in the last few years.
