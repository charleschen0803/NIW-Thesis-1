Presentation

Operator

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Evergy's Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]
Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like
to hand the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer, Lori Wright.
Please go ahead.

Lori A. Wright
VP of Corporate Planning & Investor Relations and Treasurer

Thank you, Latif. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Evergy's third quarter call. Thank you for
joining us this morning. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information. Slide 2 and the
disclosure in our SEC filings containing list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ
materially from our expectations and include additional information on non-GAAP financial measures. The
release is issued this morning, along with today's webcast slides and supplemental financial information
for the quarter are available on the main page of our website at investors.evergy.com.

On the call today, we have David Campbell, Evergy's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kirk
Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will cover our third quarter highlights,
recap our recent Investor Day and provide an update on our near-term resource plan. Kirk will cover
in more detail the third quarter results, the latest on sales and customer information and our financial
outlook for the remainder of the year. Other members of management are with us and will be available
during the question-and-answer portion of the call.

I will now turn the call over to David.

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 5 of our presentation. This morning,
we reported third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.98 per share compared to $1.73 per share a year ago
equal to a 14% increase. On a period-over-period basis, these results were driven primarily by favorable
weather, higher transmission margin, higher other income and lower income taxes, partially offset by a
decline in weather-normalized demand. For year-to-date September 30, adjusted earnings were $3.38 per
share compared to $2.82 per share a year ago, equal to a 20% increase. As with the quarter, favorable
weather is the most significant driver.

With these strong results, we are raising and narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $3.50 to
$3.60 per share, an increase from $3.20 to $3.40 per share. I commend and thank our team's ability to
execute and focus on providing safe and reliable electric service to our customers throughout the first 9
months of the year, notwithstanding the lingering pandemic impacts and a significant winter weather event
in February. Kirk will detail the drivers of our financial performance that resulted in the upside guidance
revision.

In addition, we are affirming our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.43 to $3.63 as well as our targeted
annual adjusted EPS growth target of 6% to 8% through 2025, as we laid out during our Investor Day.
Lastly, this morning, we also announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.5725 per share or
$2.29 per share on an annualized basis. This increase is consistent with our growth trajectory and reflects
our Board's confidence in the execution of our plan. Moving on to Slide 6, I'll provide a brief recap of the
business plan highlights from our recent Investor Day. As part of the event, we rebased and extended our
key targets through 2025. Our 5-year capital investments are estimated to be $10.4 billion through 2025,
of which nearly $1.5 billion is for renewables projects. This spending plan drives our projected rate base
growth of 5% to 6% annually over that same time period.

EVERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

We also extended our target for cost efficiencies and added nearly $20 million of savings in 2025,
increasing our total estimated annual O&M savings from our 2018 base year to $345 million annually
in 2025. This represents more than a 25% overall decline. Building on the strong performance and
realized cost savings achieved over the last 3 years, this trajectory implies a 1% to 2% annualized cost
productivity gain through the 5-year forecast period. The planned beneficial infrastructure investment
and additional O&M savings enabled us to extend our top-tier 6% to 8% annual growth rate and adjusted
earnings per share through 2025. We're able to fund this plan with significant cash flow and modest
incremental debt, allowing us to maintain our strong balance sheet and credit metrics with no planned
incremental equity through 2025.

Lastly, we showcased our strong ESG profile, including our significant progress in clean energy and
changing our generation mix. In 2020, 50% of our energy was emissions free and we achieved a 51%
reduction in Evergy's CO2 emissions relative to 2005 levels. We stack up well relative to our Midwest peers
in terms of both clean energy delivered to our customers and reduction in carbon emissions. We have
ambitious, but achievable goals as we advance toward our target of net 0 carbon by 2045.

Slide 7 outlines our resource plan through 2026. To further lower energy cost for customers and reduce
emissions, we plan to add more than 1,300 megawatts of new renewables split between over 500
megawatts of solar and 800 megawatts of wind through a series of yearly additions. We also plan to retire
coal operations at our plant in Lawrence, Kansas. In September, we initiated a regulatory proceeding in
Kansas called predetermination, seeking approval in advance for the Lawrence coal retirement and for the
first 190 megawatts of solar generation.

We expect to have an order in this proceeding by mid-2022. In October, we also issued a request for
proposal for 800 megawatts of wind generation projects we have sequenced across 2024 and 2025 for
the benefit of Kansas and Missouri customers. Bids are due later this month, and we plan to select a short
list of projects before the end of the year. We are targeting having negotiations completed by mid-2022.
In parallel, we will continue to evaluate potential opportunities to buy in and repower existing power
purchase agreements as initial production tax credits expire.

Before handing it over to Kirk, I'll wrap up on Slide 8, which summarizes the Evergy value proposition. The
left-hand side of the page covers what we're focused on and how we plan to execute our strategy, which
I discussed in depth during our Investor Day. The core tenets of our strategy are to advance affordability,
reliability and sustainability through a relentless focus on our customers, supported by stakeholder and
collaboration, sustainable investment and financial and operational excellence. The right-hand side of Slide
8 features what we believe are particularly attractive and distinctive features for our company.

First, we are an all-electric regulated utility with significant benefits delivered since the merger and further
opportunities that we will capture through continuous improvement, performance management and
sustained consistent execution. Second, we have significant opportunities ahead for the ongoing transition
of our generation portfolio. And we can do so cost effectively given that we'll be replacing coal with low-
cost renewables, which is a win-win for affordability and sustainability. Third, we are geographically
advantaged given our proximity to world-class wind resources in Kansas. We are well positioned to
participate in the renewables and transmission build-out that will occur as part of the national transition
to a clean energy economy. And finally, we are targeting a high-performing 6% to 8% annual growth rate
and adjusted earnings per share through 2025 at the top rank with our peers. We are very excited about
the opportunities for our company, and we are deeply committed to the sustained effort required to deliver
against our high performance objectives.

I will now turn the call over to Kirk.

Kirkland B. Andrews
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with results for the quarter on Slide 10. For the third
quarter of 2021, Evergy delivered adjusted earnings of $455 million or $1.98 per share compared to $393
million or $1.73 per share in the third quarter of 2020. The 14% increase in third quarter adjusted EPS
was driven by the following items as shown on the chart from left to right. First, there were significantly

EVERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

more cooling degree days this past quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2020, resulting in $0.20 of
favorable contribution from weather.

Adjusting for milder than normal weather experienced in the third quarter of 2020, the third quarter of
this year saw $0.13 of EPS versus normal weather assumed in our original plan. The strong favorable
weather impact this quarter was partially offset by a 1.2% decline in weather-normalized demand or
approximately $0.06 per share. Higher transmission revenue resulting from our ongoing investments to
enhance our transmission infrastructure drove about $0.06 per share. Other income increased $0.04 per
share, driven by higher investment earnings from some of our investments in early-stage energy solution
companies.

Income tax-related items, which include the impact of Kansas income tax rate exemption effective this
year and higher amortization of excess deferred income taxes, partially offset by the timing of tax credit
recognition to maintain our effective income tax rate for the year drove a net increase of $0.04 per share.
And finally, other items, which consist primarily of higher depreciation and amortization and property tax
expense as well as the impact of shares issued to BlueScape in April were partially offset by lower O&M,
which, when combined, represent a net $0.03 decrease.

I'll turn next to year-to-date results, which you'll find on Slide 11. For the 9 months ended September
30, 2021, adjusted earnings were $775 million or $3.38 per share compared to $642 million or $2.82
per share for the same period last year. Again, moving from left to right on the slide, our year-to-date
adjusted EPS drivers versus 2020 include the following: favorable weather from the first half of the
year when combined with the warm weather in the third quarter contributed $0.25 year-to-date. When
compared to normal weather assumed in our original 2021 plan, weather was $0.18 favorable. And
although weather-normalized demand increased about 1% year-to-date, the margin impact of higher
commercial and industrial sales was more than offset by an estimated 2% decline in residential sales,
resulting in about $0.01 of lower margin versus the first 9 months of 2020.

As expected, higher transmission revenues driven by our FERC transmission investments resulted in
a $0.12 increase. Other income was also $0.12 higher, driven primarily by an increase in investment
earnings due to a realized gain from the monetization of an investment in the first half of the year
combined with investment gains in the third quarter as well as higher AFUDC. The impact from the Kansas
income tax exemption and higher amortization of excess deferred income taxes contributed $0.11 of
favorability year-to-date. And finally, higher depreciation and amortization, property taxes and a slight
increase in share count were partially offset by lower O&M and interest expense, leading to a net decrease
of $0.03 per share.

Turning next to Slide 12. I'll provide a brief update on recent sales and customer trends. Weather-
normalized retail sales decreased 1.2% during the third quarter compared to last year. This was primarily
driven by lower residential sales, down 3% compared to last year, with fewer customers working from
home compared to 2020. Weather normalized commercial sales were up slightly, reflecting the slow,
steady return to normal. Industrial sales were flat with some puts and takes from multiple sectors. The
Ford plant in our jurisdiction is still experiencing headwinds from chip shortages, which have slowed down
production, and in turn electricity usage.

On the positive side, extensive oil refineries and pipelines in our jurisdictions are seeing a surge in
usage as the commodity market was driven higher in demand for their product. The pandemic recovery
continues to be slower than we originally planned and year-to-date weather-normalized demand has only
increased about 1% compared to our original full year expectations of around 2%. And as I mentioned
during our Investor Day in September, we adjusted our demand expectations for the balance of 2021,
as likely due to the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 over the summer, we now expect some of the
recovery to more normal demand and mix to take place in 2022.

Turning next to Slide 13. I'll provide greater details on the drivers of our increased and narrowed guidance
range for 2021. Starting with our previous guidance range, the left of the slide and moving again from
left to right. Due to the shift in expected demand recovery from 2021 to 2022, the earnings contribution
of weather-normalized sales is about $0.14 per share lower versus our original expectations. However,
favorable weather through the first 3 quarters, which as I mentioned earlier, we estimate contributed

EVERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

$0.18, has more than offset the delay in normalized demand recovery. The net of these 2 items is a
positive $0.04 in total sales compared to our original plan.

Continuing across the chart, the remaining positive drivers of our revised guidance include: $0.09 from
income tax benefits driven by higher excess deferred income tax amortization, $0.07 from higher AFUDC
and lower interest expense. And finally, our revised guidance includes the impact of the amount by which
we expect our nonregulated businesses to exceed our original 2021 plan. Specifically, Evergy Ventures, the
entity through which we make investments in early-stage energy solution companies as well as our power
marketing business are on track to contribute greater than normal earnings in 2021, partially offset by the
timing and phasing of certain costs, resulting in a net increase of $0.05 versus our prior guidance.

Together, these items lead to our revised 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share. Of
note, although as I mentioned, our Evergy Ventures business outperformance is one of our contributing
factors to our revised guidance. This outperformance is primarily based on year-to-date results. In
October, an equity investment in which we own a minority state, went public through an acquisition by
a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, and Evergy received shares in the public company at
closing subject to a lockup. As a result, we expect to record an unrealized gain on this investment in the
fourth quarter.

Although this fourth quarter item is not yet reflected in our revised guidance, we expect this impact to be
positive. And depending upon the fair value of accounting for the investment, it could cause our results for
the year to even exceed our updated guidance range. However, we consider any potential gain from this
investment, which we expect to monetize in 2022 when the lockup expires, the additional nonrecurring
earnings for the year relative to our ongoing expectations for this part of our business.

Lastly, we also recognize our updated 2021 guidance implies a lower fourth quarter compared to last
year. So on the right-hand side of the slide, we've included the key drivers which will impact the expected
year-over-year fourth quarter results. These drivers include the following: first, given our strong year-to-
date and expected earnings, we've made a few changes in the timing and phasing of certain cost items,
which are expected to drive about $0.06 per share in the quarter. Second, although we've seen favorable
bad debt expense in 2021, largely due to lower write-offs resulting from the extended moratorium
on disconnections, which expired in May, we've now begun to see write-offs increase and believe this
temporary trend is likely to continue, resulting in the realization of write-offs later in the year than we
originally expected.

As a result, we expect to make a change in our receivable reserve calculation in the fourth quarter, which
will lead to about $0.03 of additional bad debt expense. These 2 factors combined with other items,
including the expiry of certain tax credits in 2021, lead to the implied difference in expected fourth quarter
earnings versus 2020. And finally, turning to our affirmed 2022 adjusted EPS guidance on Slide 14. We've
updated the bridge from our revised 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 to our 2022
adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.43 to $3.63.

Starting on the left-hand side of the slide with our 2021 guidance, we normalized $0.18 of favorable
weather and a roughly $0.05 of earnings primarily from power marketing in Evergy Ventures. Although
we expect these businesses to continue to contribute earnings going forward, this adjustment is merely
associated with the outperformance in 2021, leaving their expected run rate contribution in our 2022
guidance.

After adjusting for these items, the drivers of our 2022 guidance midpoint are largely unchanged from
the walk we provided on Investor Day and include $0.12 of increased retail demand, about 2/3 of which
reflects the realization of more normal demand in 2022, which we originally expected to occur in this year.

And this shift is due to the observed delay in returning to normal demand mix due to lingering COVID
effects in 2021. The remaining portion or about 1/3 of this $0.12 demand impact reflects normal year-
over-year load growth in '22. We expect approximately $0.09 of additional earnings from transmission
revenue as we continue to make investments to improve transmission infrastructure.

EVERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

Next, additional O&M savings are expected to add around $0.05 as we continue to progress toward Tier
1 cost efficiency and our more robust long-term O&M savings objective, now representing an over 25%
reduction in O&M from 2018 to 2025.

The remaining drivers include the impact of expiring merger-related bill credits and a slight increase in
interest savings and AFUDC equity, all of which are offset by depreciation expense not yet reflected in
rates and $0.01 of other items. With that, I'll hand the call back to David.

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director
Thank you, Kirk. So for everyone on the call, we appreciate your time with us today. And now we'd be
happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just a couple of questions here, if I may. First, the updated guidance for '21, which obviously even ex
weaker weather-normalized demand is somewhat noticeably higher, right? Are you including any pull
forward of OpEx from '22? Just trying to get a sense on potential flexibility in next year's guide, especially
as we're seeing some demand drag continuing into '22 versus your prior expectations?

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director

So Shar, as Kirk mentioned, we do have a series of timing and phasing of operating costs. So that's timing
within this year. Some of that's pull forwards from the forward plan. We're not adjusting our guidance
for 2022. Any time you have the opportunity to do prudent management your cost, that you look at
that across the forward plan years and it can help with confidence in execution. But given the size of the
numbers, we're not changing our guidance for 2022. But as companies do in this circumstance with some
favorable weather, we are certainly looking at how -- and we'll continue to look at how are the pull-forward
items or other items that we can address this year. There are limits in what you can do in that range, but
as all companies look at that piece. So a chunk of it does relate to timing into year in '21.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. So you have some contingency there to cushion.

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director

We're not changing our guidance in '22, but we're -- we feel good about our ongoing execution trajectory.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just on the O&M side, obviously, some pretty sizable reductions you're expecting
through '25. How do we sort of think about where you're currently guiding versus the overall kind of
opportunity set? Do you see more to squeeze, especially as you guys are kind of shooting for Tier 1 utility
status, and even further looking at asset level transition opportunities. I mean 25% reduction is a lot. I
guess the question is, can you do more?

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director

So that's a great question, Shar. I know we've talked about this in prior calls. I think the company had
done a terrific job for Kirk's and my arrival coming in this year, a lot of cost savings achieved post merger
in '19 and '20, ongoing trajectory of those reductions. And we teed up as part of our Investor Day, we
described how we think there's an ongoing opportunity for 1% to 2% productivity gains. So we think it
will be along the lines of executing the plan that we've laid out and then continuing to drive improvements
across our business through a systematic process. So I think that, that's how we view our opportunity
set is really driving that continuous improvement over time, consistent with what we've laid out in the
Investor Day plan.

EVERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

Got it. And then just lastly for me, if I may, just on the IRP, [indiscernible] you filed earlier this year.
We've already seen multiple stakeholder groups make some noise in the Kansas docket. Staff made some
positive and constructive comments. What should we be watching for in the process for the balance of
the year across the states. And more importantly, is there any concerns around the IRP-related spending
opportunities in light of some of the input cost pressures we've seen in the renewable space. I mean,
how do you price in these headwinds as we think about future generation opportunities through '26 and
beyond?

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director

So thanks, Shar. On the -- and I'll ask Kirk to supplement the commentary. We filed for a predetermination
relating to the 190 megawatts of solar. So we'll have the chance to review that spend program and our
planned addition as part of a regulatory filing before we advance the process. Part of why that program
was sized down a little bit in scope from the initial estimates, the 350 megawatts, reflected the overall
supply chain environment and the maturity of the solar pipeline in SPP relative to the more mature
pipeline on the wind side.

So we'll continue to evaluate that. But we like that we have the opportunity to have that dialogue
proactively as part of the predetermination process. And we've launched the RFPs for wind in 2024 and
2025 as we described. So we'll see where those bids come out. Now it's -- we'll see how long the supply
chain pressures advance. But I noted that we've got a target for reaching agreements related to the RFPs
at least for the first year in mid-2022. So we'll have a good sense.

We'll have plenty of time to evaluate what we're seeing in the supply chain to make sure that what we're
achieving drives our objectives of reliability, affordability and sustainability. So we'll always keep a focus
on that. I think the intervenor comments in the IRP proceedings are relatively consistent with what
you'd expect, which probably reflects that we're striking a balance in what we're striving to do. And we'll
continue to do that, being mindful of the affordability impacts, as you know, of some of the supply chain
pressures. That's why we're trying to take a pretty systematic and diligent approach to how we tackle it.
Kirk, anything you'd add?

Kirkland B. Andrews
Executive VP & CFO

The only thing I'd add, just building on that last point. I mean, certainly, we're mindful of and not
immediately seeing the cost and supply chain pressures, they're affecting across many sectors, including,
but not limited to, renewals. Part of the reason why we made the slight shift that we did [indiscernible]
magnitude of the solar and advancing wind.

But beyond that, as we've indicated at our Investor Day, we're looking at all facets of opportunities.
Obviously, David mentioned, we launched recently our RFP. That's our primary focus. But we have some
self-development opportunities, the potential around some of those PPAs buy-ins and repowerings and
given the existing dialogue around the -- some of the aspects of the bill back better framework, which
is still a framework, but some of the potential for tax incentives, that can be potential mitigants and
help aid affordability to help offset some of that cost pressure for us. So I think we've got a lot of levers
and flexibility where that's concern, but we're certainly laser-focused to finding the right blend from an
affordability and a reliability standpoint on that on the renewables front.

Operator

Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.

Dariusz Lozny
BofA Securities, Research Division

This is Dariusz on for Julien. Just wanted to start off thinking about average customer bills as we head into
the heating season. Obviously, quite a bit of news out there about fuel, volatility and the impact that could
have on bills. Do you have -- have you quantified sort of your average estimate for how much bill could

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.

10

EVERGY, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2021

increase either on a percentage basis or on a dollar per customer basis? And could you perhaps maybe
speak to how that compares to your regional neighbors? I know there's fuel mix differences. So I think
that might go in your favor, but if you could speak to that, please.

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director

Sure. So it's obviously something we track closely. And we have a much smaller natural gas position than
some of our neighbors. I can't comment on where their bill trajectory will go, but I'm sure you've been
able to note the relative mix of gas relative to others. We -- about -- in 2020, only about 5% of our fuel
and purchased power was natural gas related. So natural gas price movements have not had a significant
impact. We do have a relatively sizable amount of coal, so the 40% range, and there has certainly been
moving in PRB pricing.

We've got some protection around that from a hedging perspective over the near term. If those pricing
pressures persist all the way through 2022, then obviously we'll have to see what those impacts are and
see what the net impacts are in the wholesale market, of course, as well. We have a very sizable wind
portfolio. And that wind portfolio will benefit relatively from higher prices when their fuel prices don't
move, of course, on the wind side.

So net, we are in a lower general bill season, where our enterprise is summer heavy. So the highest
customer bills are typically in the summer. So in the fall, we are rolling into what are typically significantly
lower customer bills. But it's something we're very focused on. Again, net relative to those who are more
natural gas intensive, they are likely to be facing more intensive fuel costs. But again, it all depends on
what their hedge approach is. But on a relative mix basis, we don't have the same exposure to natural gas
as others.

Dariusz Lozny
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. Great. And just on the predetermination filing in Kansas that you referred to in the opening
remarks, could we potentially see -- I know you talked about the time frame for when you expect an
order, I think you said mid '22. Should we expect to see a securitization filing shortly thereafter, assuming
you get a favorable order in that predetermination docket?

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So that proceeding includes asking for securitization relating to the retirement of the coal facilities at
Lawrence since the retirement of Lawrence Unit 4 as well as the shared coal handling facilities is relatively
modest in size, but we would expect to see securitization relating to that assuming that proceeding goes
as planned.

Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research.

Kirk, I just wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made a little bit ago on the Biden Build
Back Better Plan. If maybe you just want to give a little more color on what some of the changes there
could mean for you guys in terms of the wind RFP, the PPA buy-ins and then maybe also Direct Pay. Yes,
just how we should be thinking about some of the puts and takes there?

Kirkland B. Andrews
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Michael. So starting on the wind side, obviously, the prospects of an extension and kind of returning
to full power, if you will, on the production tax credit side, that's just -- that is certainly a net positive,

both in the context, as I mentioned before, from an affordability standpoint, which we're very focused on.
The magnitude of those tax credits and the reliability over a longer period of time, being more robust. I
think that's just added benefit in terms of meeting our objectives around affordability.

It also speaks to greater flexibility in terms of the cadence and pace and mix of renewable investment.
And as you recall, we sort of pull forward some of our wind investments to take advantage or at least
to an account for the existing expiry of the production tax credits, obviously, an extension thereof and
an increase thereof would give us greater flexibility where that's concerned. And I think the knock-on
effect there, as we mentioned, certainly, the buy-in of PPAs is one thing. But combining those PPAs with
repowerings, and those repowerings are going to be certainly dependent upon taking advantage of those
production tax credits.

So that gives us a greater tailwind on the latter portion of that two-pronged strategy about that PPA buy-
in, combining of repowerings. The last piece of it, I would say, is on the solar side, where the investment
tax credit is concerned, certainly the prospects of Direct Pay, for example, which is a more efficient way to
deal with that ITC, which we have to deal with, all in one lump sum, also a benefit on the solar side to us,
again, from the affordability standpoint and how that's reflected in rates.

So a lot of details to come. There are certain requirements there around that, that we need to see more
details on in terms of things like wage fairness and domestic content. But we feel optimistic that both on
the solar and wind side, that certainly creates a tailwind for us, both in terms of flexibility and affordability
for our customers as we make good on our renewables objectives.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. Super helpful. And just a follow-up there. Any thoughts on potential cash flow or balance sheet
impact from things like Direct Pay?

Kirkland B. Andrews
Executive VP & CFO

To some extent, yes. I think in terms of the Direct Pay aspect of things, I mentioned before, obviously, as
we reach the middle of the decade, we gain a greater appetite for cash taxes. And obviously, the ITC is an
offset to that. To the extent to which it becomes Direct Pay, then that isn't as directly impact on our cash
flows. But an increase in the magnitude of the PTCs can help offset. It's just another form through which
we can take advantage of that tax appetite. So net-net, again, I'd say that's certainly a positive. Maybe
it's just a different mix of how we take advantage of our increasing tax appetite once we reach the middle
of the decade and thereafter.

Michael P. Sullivan
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. And just the last one, kind of small, but on the power marketing benefit that you guys are realizing
in '21 that's in the new guide that, that's separate from Uri and just any more color on that?

Kirkland B. Andrews
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. Yes, that's correct. Good question. As you recall, we did have some power marketing margins that
we earned during the winter weather event. Those remain and have been excluded from our adjusted EPS.
The upside of the outperformance, as I termed it, is in addition to or above and beyond that item that we
had excluded from our adjusted earnings. So we had certain expectations going into the year, and the
power marketing business has just exceeded those expectations, again, above and beyond the excluded
item there.

Still a small proportion of our total business. But I think our -- if you look across power marketing
Evergy Ventures, Transource, Prairie Wind, altogether, it's even in the revised guidance with a stronger
performance, a little under 5% or less than 5% of the earnings.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Kind of a high level one about the repairing opportunity. Can you remind us how many megawatts of
wind you have under PPA currently? And how many of those are contracts that are, call it, 10 years old or
older?

Kirkland B. Andrews
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Michael, it's Kirk. It's about 3.8 gigawatts in total on -- in terms of our PPA portfolio. And as we had
laid out, I think, on the Investor Day in one of our slides, we kind of showed the roll-off. And we're very
focused on the subset of that portion in terms of contracts. Those contracts really don't begin expiring
until just after the middle of the decade. But our focus here is on the expiry of the PTCs. We've got a little
more than 1.2 gigawatts of that or almost 1.3 gigawatts of that, 3.8 gigawatts was PTCs rather, production
tax credits, are expiring between now and the middle of the decade. As those PPA or PTCs expire, we think
that's probably the most meaningful subset of those 3.8 gigawatts PPAs, that we're focused on in the near
term around repowering and buying opportunities. Because our counterparties have obviously taken full
advantage at that point of all of the PTCs. And I think that's probably the targets that we're looking at, if
that helps.

Michael Jay Lapides
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And if you do a buy in a couple of things. First of all, that's not embedded in your CapEx guidance,
so in your rate base guidance. That would be upside to that. And then the second question. Lots of those
projects have project debt. How would you -- would you just basically take out the project debt or assume
-- or most of those on -- have project debt that was an amortizing loan, so you're kind of near the tail end
of that debt. I'm just curious about kind of taking a project off the books of a nonregulated developer and
put it into a utilities rate base?

Kirkland B. Andrews
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, good question. I think we probably would not look to transfer, obviously, the project debt because it's
relatively fully amortized. It would probably be a full buy-in. And so we purchased this on an unlevered
basis. And obviously, some of those proceeds would go to -- take out the existing project debt. So they
think about it as a pure rate base investment on the PPA buy-in side.

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director

And Michael, your first part of your question, you are correct. None of this is in our current CapEx
guidance. The PPA buying and repowering, we're able to get those negotiated. Those would be upside or in
addition to our current guidance.

Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Our next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.

Just I apologize, but if we could just go over the investment income and the expectations for 2022. When
looking at Slide 14, I assume that the investment income -- let me ask you this. So what do you -- and
I apologize for not just completely getting this. But in 2021, what is the expected investment income in
total? I see it's $0.12 so far to date. But with the SPAC and everything else that you're talking about,
where is it going to sort of come in, in 2021?

Kirkland B. Andrews
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. In 2021, on the power marketing side, we've probably got about $0.05 of total impact from
investment income that comes from a couple of sources. Some of that is, we, like a lot of other utilities,
invest in other funds, Energy Impact Partners is one of those. So some of that is the mark. Some of
that is, as I mentioned before, earlier in the year, on a direct investment side, we actually had an actual
monetization of that, and that's probably the disproportionate share of that through the first half of the
year is that monetization event. So it's a combination of those 2 things. Obviously, that contributed to
exceeding our expectations on the upside, obviously.

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director

And I'll just clarify. Kirk is absolutely right. He prefaced that and said power marketing, but that's the
Evergy Ventures investment arm.

Kirkland B. Andrews
Executive VP & CFO

Evergy Ventures. Yes. Evergy Ventures, the investment arm. Thanks, David. And then if you look forward
into 2022 and beyond, as I mentioned before, that $0.05 is outperformance. On an ongoing basis,
certainly in our '22 guidance, it's more like a $0.01 or $0.02 on the Evergy Ventures contribution.

Operator

Our next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to
turn the call back over to David Campbell for closing remarks. Sir?

David A. Campbell
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thank you very much. We appreciate all of you joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing
many of you in person next week at EEI. Signing off.

This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
