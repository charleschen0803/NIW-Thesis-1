NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 02, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the NetApp Q4 and Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call.
[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations.

Kris Newton
VP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations

Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is
being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.

During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial
outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2022, our
expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns and our ability to continue
overall growth, gain market share and scale our cloud business, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.
We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.

Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market
conditions, such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic and the IT
capital spending environment as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, grow our cloud
business and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with
the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K, including in the
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors
sections.

During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated.
Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website.

I'll now turn the call over to George.

George Kurian
CEO & Director

Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I want
to take a minute to acknowledge that it's been over a year that we have all been working remotely. I'm
encouraged by the public health and economic improvements in many parts of the world, but the recovery
is uneven. As you know, we have a large team in India. Our thoughts are with them as they deal with a
distressing surge in COVID cases. Thank you to the entire NetApp team for your dedication, focus and
execution throughout this challenging year.

Now to the results of the quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter results, capping off a solid year of
growth. Our results were all above our Q4 guidance ranges. I am most excited by the return of product
revenue to growth, the strength of our public cloud ARR and an all-time high free cash flow.

Our performance was broad-based as certain verticals, the U.S. and parts of Europe and Asia are
recovering faster than many expected. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives have been accelerated
by the pandemic and companies look to NetApp to support these key initiatives.

Going into FY '21, we had 2 clear priorities: returning to growth in our storage business, powered by share
gains from our industry-leading file, block and object software; and scaling our highly differentiated public
cloud services business. As I reflect on the past year, I'm proud of what we've achieved during a globally
challenging period. We remain focused in executing our strategy and extending our innovation.

In Q4, product revenue grew 6%, and our all-flash array business grew 11% year-over-year. Based on our
growth, I am confident that we have gained share in the storage and all-flash markets. We advanced our

hybrid cloud portfolio with the introduction of ONTAP 9.9 and Astra. This innovation will support continued
product revenue growth and share gains through fiscal year '22.

Additionally, we continue to make good progress with Keystone with many new wins, including our largest
ever Keystone deal. We are reaching more customers than ever before with our public cloud business.
Over the course of fiscal year '21, we added approximately 1,500 new to NetApp customers with public
cloud services and grew our total cloud customer count by 137% from Q4 fiscal year '20. In addition to
adding new cloud customers, existing cloud customers are expanding their spend with us.

Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate increased to 252% in the fourth quarter. Cloud Volumes,
Cloud Insights and Spot all performed well in the quarter, driving our public cloud services' ARR to $301
million exiting fiscal year '21, an increase of 171% year-over-year.

As we have said repeatedly, our cloud strategy strongly advantages NetApp. I'll use a customer example
to illustrate how cloud helps us to acquire new customers and drive growth in our on-premises solutions.
As a part of its digital transformation strategy, a leading car manufacturer decided to migrate workloads
from its on-premises data centers to the Azure cloud. Despite never having used NetApp previously, the
customer chose NetApp Cloud Volumes to host its file-based data and NetApp Cloud Sync to rapidly move
data from its Dell EMC systems to the cloud.

In addition to delivering a high-performance data store in the cloud, Cloud Volumes provides out-of-the-
box cross-region replication of production data to a secondary cloud environment, high availability to
meet the service level requirements of critical applications and cost savings through automatic tiering to
Azure Blob Storage. Because of the breadth and depth of the value NetApp delivered, the customer is now
looking to deploy a hybrid cloud environment and plans to use NetApp on premises as well as increases
NetApp usage in the public cloud.

As I noted earlier, the pandemic accelerated and elevated the importance of customers cloud and digital
transformation initiatives. We expect that this trend will be ongoing and that NetApp will continue to
benefit from it. Customers appreciate the value we bring as a cloud-led, data-centric software company to
simplify and modernize existing data centers to quickly and confidently deploy applications and to securely
manage data on the public cloud.

We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise data management technology. Our
cloud solutions drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market, and enable us to reach
new customers. We began our cloud journey 7 years ago with the introduction of Cloud ONTAP, now
Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Our initial focus was to leverage the cloud to deliver backup and disaster recovery
services to our installed base.

We saw that enterprises wanted to move workloads to the cloud. To address that need, we began working
with the leading cloud providers to deliver Cloud Volumes service, a fully managed service with the
application certifications required to support mission-critical production workloads in the cloud. We then
recognize the opportunity to expand beyond storage management and optimization to infrastructure
monitoring and compute management and optimization services, which led to the development of Cloud
Insights and the acquisition of Spot. These services, Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights and Spot, are now
the primary growth engines of our public cloud services business. They are well established for enterprise
applications, and we are taking each of them into the cloud-native world, further expanding our market
opportunity.

NetApp Astra offers application-aware data management that protects, moves and manages data-rich
Kubernetes workloads. Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling
compute resources to maximize utilization and availability while minimizing costs.

Cloud Insights for Kubernetes provides simplified infrastructure monitoring to quickly identify performance
issues and resource constraints. Together, our public cloud services give our customers and especially
their cloud ops and DevOps teams, a robust suite of multi-cloud infrastructure management services.
We plan to press our advantage here by focusing our efforts on enhancing our go-to-market activities,
deepening our cloud partnerships and delivering best-in-class organic and inorganic innovations. We

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 02, 2021

intend to leverage our deep infrastructure expertise and our credibility with the cloud providers to expand
our multi-cloud infrastructure management services.

My confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year '25 is further
enhanced by the strength and uniqueness of our cloud services position. Our focused execution last year
has set us up well for fiscal year '22. We have returned to growth, we're gaining share in key storage
markets and our public cloud services are at a scale where they are positively impacting total company
billings and revenue growth. Our momentum underscores our value to customers in a hybrid multi-cloud
world.

In fiscal year '22, we plan to accelerate our public cloud services and continue to grow our hybrid cloud
business. I am excited about the year ahead and confident in our ability to deliver top line growth by
supporting our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys.

Before I turn it over to Mike to walk through our financial results, I want to take a moment to thank
Brad Anderson who let us know that he intends to retire at the end of fiscal year '22. Brad has been
instrumental in leading the maturation of our hybrid cloud group, and we will continue to leverage his
leadership and expertise this year. We are actively engaged in identifying a successor to ensure a smooth
transition.

With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be
referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As we look back on what was an unprecedented
year, I cannot help but be incredibly proud of the focus, execution and commitment of the entire NetApp
team.

We delivered billings of $5.9 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year while revenue of $5.7 billion grew
6%. We delivered free cash flow of $1.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year while continuing to aggressively
invest in our public cloud franchise. We finished the year strong with Q4 billings of $1.7 billion, up 12%
year-over-year. While revenue of $1.6 billion was up 11% year-over-year. Both were solidly ahead of our
expectations, driven by accelerating enterprise demand throughout the quarter.

Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high end of guidance. Q4 free cash flow of
$521 million was an all-time high for NetApp. As George highlighted, public cloud ARR of $301 million was
up 171% year-over-year and an impressive 27% sequentially.

In fiscal '21, the scale of our cloud franchise really started to impact the overall growth profile of NetApp,
delivering 4 of the 9 points in billings growth and 3 of the 6 points in revenue growth. In addition to the
strong cloud ARR performance, we are excited that we exited the year with cloud gross margins near our
overall corporate average.

Given the growing impact on our total company performance, we anticipate sharing more detail on our
public cloud business in fiscal '22. When combined, software revenue, recurring support and cloud revenue
totaled $1.1 billion and increased 18% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue.

For the first time in company history, we ended Q4 with over $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase
of 8% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue
growth.

Product revenue returned to growth in Q4. Importantly, we expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal
'22. Product revenue of $840 million increased 6% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we have
seen throughout fiscal '21, software product revenue of $480 million increased 18% year-over-year, driven
by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio.

Recurring support and cloud revenue of $641 million was also at all-time company high and was up
17% year-over-year, constituting 41% of total revenue. Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high end

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 02, 2021

of guidance. Product gross margin was 54.3% and benefited from the higher all-flash system mix. Our
recurring support, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing
business for us with gross margin of 82%.

Operating margin of 23% was nicely ahead of our expectations, while EPS of $1.17 came in above the
high end of guidance, despite a $0.05 headwind from a higher-than-forecasted tax rate. Cash flow from
operations was $559 million and free cash flow was $521 million, representing 34% of revenue. Cash flow
came in higher than expected in part due to strong collections as evidenced by the DSO metric of 55 days.

Full year fiscal '21 free cash flow of $1.2 billion was up 25% year-over-year and represented 20% of
revenue. We closed Q4 with $4.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Given recent developments in
the broader technology supply chain, I want to reiterate our confidence in our ability to meet end demand
as we head into Q1. We have an excellent supply chain team, and they have been working closely with
our partner ecosystem to ensure backlog and customer lead times remain at normal levels throughout
fiscal '22. Towards this goal, we will be investing incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term
commitments to help mitigate risk of supply shortages. Given our strong balance sheet and low cost of
capital, we feel good about this investment.

Now to guidance. In fiscal '22, we expect revenues to grow 6% to 7% year-over-year with billings
expected to outpace revenue given the continued strength in recurring support contracts and cloud
services. In fiscal '22, we expect continued momentum and share gains in our cloud-connected all-flash
portfolio. We will also continue to grow and invest in our diversified public cloud services portfolio. We
are raising the low end of our fiscal '22 guide and now expect to exit fiscal '22 with public cloud ARR of
$425 million to $500 million driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships and
continued product innovation.

Similar to the seasonal pattern we experienced in fiscal '21, we anticipate Q2 and Q4 to be our strongest
quarters for net new public cloud ARR. This seasonal cadence is driven mainly by our semiannual sales
compensation plans. As George noted, we have increased confidence in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in
public cloud ARR in fiscal '25.

In fiscal '22, we expect gross margin to be roughly flat year-over-year at 67% to 68% as improving cloud
margins are balanced with strong demand for our hybrid cloud products. We anticipate operating margin
to range between 21% and 22% as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives while delivering strong
operating leverage. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be between
$2.75 billion and $2.8 billion.

The year-over-year increase in our expense base is being driven by continued investment in revenue-
generating activities, including expanding our cloud portfolio, targeted investments in sales resources and
continued investment in our customer success sales team.

Moving down the P&L. We expect interest expense to be $65 million to $70 million and our effective tax
rate to be approximately 19%. While we get a bit of delevering below the operating income line, as a
result of the higher interest expense and tax rate, we are committed to delivering $4.45 to $4.65 in fiscal
'22 EPS, representing 12% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect to again generate over $1.1
billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our cloud
services franchise.

Factored into the year-over-year free cash flow generation is a step-up in CapEx to $225 million to $235
million. Our public cloud partners, in particular Azure, are driving us hard to build out additional global
capacity for our cloud offerings. Even with this added investment, we expect cloud gross margins to
become accretive to our corporate average as we move through fiscal '22.

Generating over $1.1 billion in free cash flow will allow us to continue to deliver on our capital allocation
commitments while also investing in our key strategic areas. The dividend will remain the first call on
capital. As you saw today, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. Share repurchases will
also continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. Towards this goal, our Board approved an
additional $500 million in buyback authorization.

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 02, 2021

In fiscal '22, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we
expect share count to remain flat at 229 million shares exiting fiscal '22. Consistent with NetApp's long
history of disciplined M&A, the remaining 30% of free cash flow generation will go towards our acquisition
strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic cloud services roadmap.

Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.37 billion and $1.47 billion,
which at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase in revenues year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross
margin to be approximately 68% and operating margin to range between 19% and 20%.

Assumed in this guidance are Q1 operating expenses of $680 million to $690 million. We anticipate our
tax rate to be approximately 19%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $0.89 and
$0.97 per share. Assumed in our Q1 guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million.

In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their unwavering support this past
year and most importantly, a huge shout out to the entire NetApp employee base for redefining what it
means to work as a team during what was a challenging year in so many ways. We are more confident
than ever in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I'll now
hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?

Kris Newton
VP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations
Thanks, Mike. Let's open the call for Q&A. Please keep to just one question so we can get to as many
people as possible. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on the nice trend. I was hoping if you could just talk a little bit more on the cloud data services
business. And I guess, a, I would love to understand sort of what really drove the upside in the quarter
versus the $260 million to $290 million guide that you already had out there?

And then really, when I think about the full year number you provided of $425 million to $500 million, the
low end, I think, is ticking up by $20 million, $25 million. What is driving the confidence in this business
as you go into next year? And how important is it for you to scale beyond Azure to achieve the fiscal year
targets laid out?

George Kurian
CEO & Director

Listen, thank you for the question. We have been working on multiple innovation parts of our portfolio, all
of which performed extremely strongly. Cloud Volumes for storage, Cloud Insights for monitoring, Spot for
compute management, all had really strong Q4s and overall, really strong years.

We saw good expansion in the number of customers and strong growth in the number of new to NetApp
customers. We saw customers spending against their digital transformation and their cloud programs
throughout the quarter. So it was a smooth trajectory through the quarter. And I think that sets us up well
for next year.

I think if you look at our dollar-based net retention rate, you can see that our organic business grew
strongly this year, and we had about $60 million of this year being inorganic from acquisitions of Spot,
Talon and CloudJumper. So when you back that out, We expect next year's growth rate to also continue
the acceleration of our organic portfolio and continued strength of our inorganic portfolio.

We have a really good and differentiated portfolio of services. We have deep partnerships and are
expanding the range of things we do with the hyperscalers. And we are growing our customer base of
people who are doing many business-critical projects on the public clouds with us. So I'm really excited
with every confidence. We'll tell you more about our cloud business, as Mike indicated, as we go through
the year, giving you more details on it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.

Roderick B. Hall
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

I'm going to do the old question and clarification thing, if I can. The question is on ARR and what the
ceiling on that is. Obviously, you've done really well there. And I'm curious if you could, George, maybe
just give us some idea of what the -- what do you think the headroom is there? Because clearly, there's a
lot of growth coming through.

And then the clarification just on the EPS calculations for the full year guide, we're getting a number lower
than the range you guys are giving. So I'm not sure if using all the inputs you're talking about, we get
something like $4.41. So I'm not sure if you add all that up, why we would be ending up at a different
place than maybe your guide is. So I don't know, Mike or if you could clarify that, that would be helpful.

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 02, 2021

CEO & Director

Thanks, Rod. With regard to the cloud portfolio, listen, I think the heavy lift in terms of getting the
innovation portfolio to be in really good shape is behind us. I think we have, as I said, 3 really strong
innovation engines, and we are bringing out cloud-native innovations across those lineups as well through
the course of this summer. We are making investments, as we indicated last quarter, to accelerate and
expand the range of things we're doing in the cloud portfolio.

With regard to what's it going to take to further accelerate the course of the business, it's all the things
that we're doing, right? We're expanding the number of sellers and revenue-generating teams facing
customers. We've seen really good success with Microsoft in terms of their route to market. We're working
with the other hyperscalers to also train and expand the range of ways we take our products to market
with them. And we're building our customer service and customer success teams. I feel even more
confident that we have the range of capabilities to achieve the $1 billion target in ARR that we indicated.
And the customer use cases that we are deploying on our public cloud portfolios, these are run-the-
business applications, mission-critical, highly differentiated business value-creating applications. So I feel
really, really good about where we are at the year.

Mike, do you want to take the other part of the question?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Sure. Thanks, George. Rod, so just want to make sure if we could go through it separately with you and
the team. We want to make sure that pays the gross interest is not the net interest. It could be in the
OIE calculation as well. So -- and there's a lot of sensitivity, obviously, to that count. So it's probably
below operating income that it's a little bit different in your models. We're happy to walk you through that
separately.

Roderick B. Hall
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Mike, just for the call, could you maybe say what that OI&E number is? Then people can just plug that in.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. So we said $65 million to $70 million for the interest. So for the OIE, what we have in there is -- yes,
that's the interest, that's what we did on the -- in my script.

And as you know, that number jumps around quite a bit. There's more than just obviously interest in that
OIE number.

Operator

Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on the quarter, clearly confident in kind of how the story is progressing. I know
you touched on this in your prepared remarks a little bit, but I just wanted to go back to kind of
the component environment. There's a lot of discussion out there around SSDs and some controller
constraints. And pricing moving upward on flash and SSDs in general, just help us maybe appreciate the
confidence that you have in component supply and how you're reacting to any kind of inflationary pricing
dynamic?

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 02, 2021

Sure, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So we have certainly contemplated the challenges in the supply
chain when providing our gross margin guidance for Q1 and fiscal '22. So [indiscernible], they've really
performed well all year long, working closely with our suppliers. And we have confidence we can continue
that performance this coming year.

As you know, we're a cloud-based software company. Product margins, we expect to continue to benefit
from the higher-margin software-rich configurations. And we continue to do a lot of hard work on the
services margin. As we talked about, cloud margins should continue to improve as we go through the year
as well as you'll see the benefits of the consumption of the deployed system and more increase in our
Software as a Service.

There's always unforeseen circumstances that may come into play. But as we sit here today, we feel good
about it. And when you talk about total -- our total component costs, we expect it to be a little bit of a
tailwind in the first half. And then based on prices that we have today and you know as well as I, those
things change, potentially a little bit of a headwind in the second half but we have baked that into our
guidance.

George Kurian
CEO & Director

With regard to our technology portfolio, as Mike said, we have a range of configurations that we can
support our customers with all the way from 900 gigs to 16 terabytes. And so we have plenty of capability
to given the flexibility in our software operating system to qualify the right components to meet customer
needs and support them.

With regard to the demand environment and gross margins, listen, as Mike said, we've operated through
a tough year and done a really good job. I think that you'll see us continue to remain prudent, balancing
end-user demand with margin management as we go through the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.

Nikolay Todorov
Longbow Research LLC

Congrats from me as well on the great results. George, I do appreciate the full year guide. I'm just
wondering if we can double-click maybe on the revenue outlook, 6% to 7% growth. Can you give some
more color around the assumptions there? Maybe if you can talk how much of that comes from share
gains versus the market or any breakdown between the drivers of product or CDS or software?

George Kurian
CEO & Director

Okay. Listen, as we go through the year, we see a continuing improvement in public health and the overall
demand environment. We have been benefiting from cloud and digital transformation projects through the
course of the year. We have not seen any major -- so we don't see some unique snapback or something
like that in government spending or in enterprise spending. We see us benefiting from long-term trends
and projects that are strategic to customers.

We see more countries, especially the U.S. and parts of Western Europe come online in a more significant
way through the course of our fiscal year. The U.S. more likely in the first part of the fiscal year. Europe
coming online more strongly in the second half of our fiscal year.

We have every confidence that our product portfolio is differentiated and we'll continue to see product
revenue grow faster than services revenue and the strength of our cloud portfolio. We have a much bigger
base of customers now in the cloud business. We have a much broader range of application certifications
that we entered last year. And so we feel really, really good about the year ahead.

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 02, 2021

Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.

Matthew Normand Cabral
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Yes. I was wondering if you can give an update on the ramp of the 200 quota-bearing heads that you've
added over the past, I think it was 18 months or so, just where they are in their ramps relative to full
productivity? And as we're heading into fiscal '22, just how you're thinking about investments in sales
capacity for the next fiscal year and beyond?

George Kurian
CEO & Director

I think, as we said, the typical sales productivity ramp happens over the course of 4 quarters. We are
-- the 200 reps that we started adding in fiscal year '20 are fully productive. They're part of NetApp
teams. You saw some of the benefits from their performance and additions to our teams, particularly in
the Americas business, which was really strong, and it sets us up well for what we think will be a strong
American recovery over the course of the next 12 months.

With regard to continued additions, as Mike has said and what we have said before, we continue to be
prudent about where we add those teams. We will do so where we see demand and environments being
strong. And we'll tell you more about the course of that. We added some headcount in our customer
success teams and in our cloud teams this past quarter, you should anticipate us continuing to do that to
support the growth of the cloud portfolio. But Mike, if you want to add any other color?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. Thanks, George. So I would just underline the additions that we talked about last quarter and this
quarter as well into specific areas around cloud and then the customer success team, which is, as you all
know, in a cloud business, super important in terms of upsell, cross-sell renewals. So we do continue to
make investments there. And I think you've seen some of the results in the ARR results this quarter.

Next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.

Kathryn Lynn Huberty
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Public cloud profitability is ramping faster alongside the better revenue performance. Is that purely due to
revenue scale? Or have you tuned the business model in any way to capture cost efficiencies? And then
Mike, just as a follow-up to that, can you clarify whether we should expect cloud margins for the full year
2022 to be dilutive, neutral or accretive to the model?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Sure. Thanks for the question, Katy. Let me do the last one first. So we said, as we go through the year,
we expected cloud margins to be accretive to the total company average, so as we get through the year
and certainly ending the year. And then, yes, we have seen a much bigger increase in our cloud margins
than we had originally expected. Certainly, scale, revenue scale matters. I would also give a lot of kudos
to the team, though, for being really efficient in terms of how they use not only the hardware but also
all the stuff that goes to support those businesses as it relates to people and processes. So it's all of the
above, but certainly, growth in ARR is the key driver followed next by a really good job by that team in
terms of managing the margins.

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 02, 2021

Katy, I think we have many avenues as we have described to continue to drive the gross margins in our
cloud business. There's a growing portfolio of software-only offerings in the cloud business. Spot, Cloud
Insights, several versions of our Cloud Volumes offerings, are all software. We -- Mike mentioned the
hardware utilization. We have brought out new versions of our ONTAP operating systems that continue to
be more efficient in terms of data management and storage efficiency. And so we feel very good about our
path to continuing to improve cloud gross margins in the direction that Mike articulated.

Operator

Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

Wamsi Mohan
BofA Securities, Research Division

You noted some seasonality in Cloud ARR through the course of the year where Q2, Q4 are typically
higher. I was wondering, is it -- would it be accurate to think that the net organic growth sequentially
should be at least at a higher level relative to last year, even though we look at some -- maybe some
seasonality going into Q1? And can you give us any color on these cloud deals, how much of those were
NetApp generated versus partner generated?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. So on the organic growth, Wamsi, what I -- this is Mike, by the way, I would point you to the dollar-
based net retention number. And as you saw in the quarter, it actually accelerated quarter-over-quarter.
So you can assume, if you take a look at that, that the organic business is doing, call it, the organic
business is doing very, very well. And as George talked about, a lot of those offerings are -- is that organic
business. And we don't break out the contribution from the hyperscalers versus the core business or the
NetApp business. What I would say is a lot of the seasonal pickup that you see in Q2 and Q4 is driven by
our sales teams, in addition, obviously, with the hyperscalers.

And I just want to underline that, please, which is, hey, when you guys do your models for next year,
please make sure that you take that seasonality into account, don't just take the increase in ARR and
divide it by 4. There is absolutely seasonality in that business as you've seen in the last 2 years.

Operator

Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.

Steven Bryant Fox
Fox Advisors LLC

George, I was just wondering, when I listened to everything that you said, you talked about improving
market share. It sounds like a better mix as you go through the year. You had accelerating digital
transformation engagements during the quarter and into this quarter. And then when I look at the full year
guidance, it seems to imply when I look at the market, you're expecting some sort of deceleration as you
go up throughout the year even when I take into account some of the tougher comparisons. Am I thinking
about that conservatism, right? Or is there anything else you would say on the markets?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Listen, I think when we look at the full year guidance for next year, we've guided 6% to 7% in terms of
revenue growth. I think that what you see from us is real confidence in the business, the second half of
the year is on a compare basis compared to a stronger second half this year as enterprise spending came
back online through COVID, right? So it isn't an expectation of us having a deceleration in terms of our
ability to grow cloud or gain share. It's just a kind of a realization that the second half of this year is a
stronger compare than the first half of this year.

The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.

James Dickey Suva
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

My question, and it's kind of a clarification, but also related forward-looking is, can you clarify for this
quarter, how much of the revenues were organic versus acquisition? And then the outlook, George, I know
you mentioned the $1 billion run rate, is that based upon all organic? I assume that's the case, but I just
wanted to clarify because I think Mike mentioned about 30% of cash flow could be used for M&A, but I
just kind of want to clarify organic versus M&A as you sit today, reported and as you look out. And again,
congratulations on the great results and outlook.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Jim, it's Mike. On the first one from the organic contribution of revenue, it was very small. It was less than
0.5 percentage point of growth. It was really not much at all in terms of -- but keep in mind that, that is
related to the cloud acquisitions earlier in the year, not much of an impact at all. And in the quarter, it was
very little.

George Kurian
CEO & Director

I think, Jim, when we look at the business, we feel very good about our portfolio of capabilities that
we have today getting us to that $1 billion ARR number in fiscal year '25. We're not going to break
out organic versus inorganic. I think we feel that we've achieved a full year of integration of our core
acquisitions, Spot, CloudJumper and Talon.

So we feel that the core bets are in place for this year. We will continue to look at inorganic acquisitions to
fill out our portfolio, right? So we think that we have a strong path to a differentiated position in the cloud
market. We feel really strong about the capabilities that we have. We will tell you more about it through
the course of the business, through the course of -- as we expand the cloud business.

And I'll just sit on 3 things, right? We are growing our cloud business while growing our core business.
We are acquiring a lot of net new customers. We are accelerating our organic business growth and our
inorganic acquisitions. And so I feel really, really good about our business overall. Cloud gross margins, as
Mike said, are near the corporate average. And as we go through next year, will be accretive to company
gross margins. So I just feel very, very good about our opportunity in the cloud and the work that our
team has been doing with the cloud providers, and we're going to double down on it.

Next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.

Shannon Siemsen Cross
Cross Research LLC

I had a question on cash flow. I understand that you guided to over $1.1 billion and this fiscal 2022 is
going to have pressure from inventory and higher CapEx. But as you think about the model on a longer-
term basis, should we expect that when you don't have to buy excess inventory, we'll start to see cash
flow growth that may be more closely mirrors what you're able to do in terms of earnings? Or will the
increased CapEx be a drag for a longer period of time?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Shannon, it's Mike. So thanks for the question on cash flow, happy to do that. So a couple of things. If you
look over the last 4 years, the operating cash flow results in NetApp have really mirrored the operating
-- non-GAAP operating income. It's like 107% of that number. So we do expect over time that we'll see
operating cash flow mirror operating income growth.

NETAPP, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUN 02, 2021

Now there's -- it's going to bump around a little bit, and I'm going to do operating and then I'll take you to
free cash flow. Next year, for instance, in fiscal '22, we would expect to see operating cash flow growth be
a little bit lower than earnings just because of the working capital impact of some of the expenses in '21,
and we put that in the script.

From a free cash flow perspective, we really look at next year CapEx as hopefully the high watermark. A
couple of pieces there. One is the -- we are certainly continuing to install hardware and some of the data
centers to support the cloud business. As George talked about, we're super excited about some of the
software options there as well. And as we have more software defined, that will help. Also next year in
that number, there's about $50 million in CapEx related to 2 facilities projects, related to our Wichita site
and to a lesser extent, our new building in San Jose.

We obviously have a little bit of facilities CapEx, but that's a big number next year. That's why we feel
comfortable, going forward, that we can have CapEx below the $200 million that I discussed in the script.
So I just want to walk you through those puts and takes. But over time, yes, I do expect operating cash
flow to pretty much near operating income with some bumping around every year largely due to working
capital.

The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.

Ananda Prosad Baruah
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. I guess just going back to George and Mike to new sales force set. Is
there any -- I guess, is sort of the go forward on that, the incremental -- is there anything meaningfully
incremental that collectively those add initiatives can contribute. And not just with regard, I mean, I know
the 200 were sort of across the portfolio. So I'm really thinking in totality, not just on the cloud side, but
also on the new customer side and with regards to how you were repositioning the go-to customer from a
solution perspective? And that's it.

George Kurian
CEO & Director

I think we'll continue to be careful about where we add sales teams. I think we constantly rebalance to
areas of opportunity, both in terms of the composition of the sales force and the locations where we put
the head count. I think, as I've said before, the recovery will be at different rates in different geographies.
And I think as the public data indicates, the Americas is the place where we expect the recovery to
be more pronounced this coming year. Europe lagging 6 to 9 months thereafter, and the rest of the
developing economies maybe 6 to 9 months after that. So we'll prioritize any additions in accordance with
how we see the end user demand.

With cloud, we have been adding, step-wise, I think one of the important things that we're focused on this
year is to get our frontline sales teams to be balanced with selling cloud and our systems in customers'
data centers. And so I feel like, listen, we're not going to have a stepwise addition in our investment. We'll
do it as the business comes. And we feel very good about the disciplined approach we've taken and the
payoffs for those investments in fairly short order.

Ananda Prosad Baruah
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

And George, are the current adds or the adds so far, are they fully optimized at this point?

George Kurian
CEO & Director

I think on the 200 heads, as we've said, they are fully productive, fully part of the NetApp sales team. We
are adding some -- we added some cloud headcount in last quarter. We anticipate to add some more this

year. Alongside the course of the business, they will take some time to get productive, but those are in the
same range of productivity ramps as our traditional sales headcount.

I think what you see from this coming year from our guidance to the coming year is that revenue outpaces
the growth in operating expense, leading to additional leverage in our business model. That reflects our
disciplined approach to investing where we see the opportunities.

Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with FIG.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Yes. I joined the call late, so I apologize if I'm repeating the question. I noticed your inventories are at a
2-year low. And I want to see what's your strategy? And how, I guess, you're going to be out buying key
components, especially storage? And I have a quick follow-up.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Sure, Mehdi. It's Mike. So yes, we had very good inventory turns at the end of Q4. As I mentioned in the
script, we -- and we've already started and we will expect to continue a couple of different programs. One
is to double down on some of the key components related to our storage products to make sure that we
have enough inventory. We've already done that. And we will continue to do that.

We will also add some safety stocks so that if there are issues throughout the world, then hopefully, we're
able to respond to that. In addition, we've also -- we'll have longer, I'll call it, purchase orders that we
will extend through the year. So we're doing everything that we can to make sure that we have enough
inventory. I would expect, in Q1, you should see those turns probably go back to the 12 to 14 number.
And again, given the all cost of capital, our goal to make sure that we always have product and we could
meet customer requirements, we think that's a very good investment. So thanks for the question. Yes, you
should see those inventories increase. And the inventory turns go down in Q1 and likely through the rest
of fiscal '22.

Mehdi Hosseini
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Great. And just a quick follow-up. Your cloud services margins is becoming accretive. But is that higher
cost of component that is capping the gross margin?

George Kurian
CEO & Director

Listen, I think with regard to component costs, as Mike said, as we look out the next year, We see that the
component costs in aggregate for the full year is going to be relatively flat for this year with some puts
and takes in terms of the mix. I think that with regard to cloud gross margins, it's really reflecting the
balance of certain regions getting more heavily utilized and seeing customer consumption of the installed
footprint while we make investments in other regions to continue to expand our business.

And that trade-off between investing to continue to expand the business with the growth in ARR is the
balance we walk. I think as I also mentioned, we have several other avenues to continue to drive gross
margins in cloud. The software mix in the portfolio is growing with solutions like Spot and Cloud Insights
and some versions of our Cloud Volumes products being software-only.

The second is we continue to drive efficiency in the software, in ONTAP operating system software. So
there are lots of avenues to continue to accelerate cloud gross margins. Team has done a good job this
year, and we expect it to be accretive to company gross margins as we go through next fiscal year.

Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.

Shek Ming Ho
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Maybe one more question on gross margin. In the past, you talked about a target to get product gross
margin back to the mid-50s. You are at 54% and change already this quarter. Should we expect this gross
margin to continue to improve over the next few quarters given the mix shift towards the software heavy-
side products? Should we think about hardware and software margins both still have room to grow? And it
sounds like higher component costs may not have an impact in the near term, but I just want to confirm
that.

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes, Sidney. So it's Mike. We have guided in our fiscal '21, in our Q1 numbers, product gross margins to
be relatively consistent with how we exited Q4. Again, component costs over the full year, at this point, as
we sit here today, relatively flat. It will move around a little bit by quarter, but keep in mind as well, mix
matters a lot in that as well.

Also in Q1, we talked about 68% gross margins. Keep in mind that there's a much bigger component of
revenue in Q1 that's services versus product. So you also get that bump in margin. You saw that in the
last couple of Q1s as well. So as we sit here today, we don't see a lot of movement in the gross margin
numbers again. That's based on the component costs that we see today. Mix does matter in the quarter,
but we've largely stayed relatively consistent with how we're exiting Q4.

Nehal Sushil Chokshi
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Congrats on a great quarter. Great guidance. And also, thank you for the providing the extra visibility in
PCS in terms of profitability with the gross margin comment, which is actually quite impressive about the
scale. But I always want more. So my question here is what about the operating income profitability of the
PCS division? And/or maybe you can comment on where on the rule of 40 is PCS operating at right now?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

So I want to make sure I understand the question. You're not talking about gross margins. You're talking
about operating margins, Nehal?

Nehal Sushil Chokshi
Northland Capital Markets, Research Division

Correct. Correct. And then maybe if you want to put that into the context of rule of 40?

Michael J. Berry
Executive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer

Yes. So at this point, as you said, you always want more. We feel good about talking about our gross
margins. We're not going to go down to operating margins in that business, that gets into a lot of
allocations and things. So what we're going to do is we're going to focus the business on gross margin.
Do we certainly look at OpEx and where we spend the money? Yes, we do. So in terms of the rule of 40,
again, we have to go down the operating income. We won't do that. We will keep it at the gross margin
discussion.

Our last question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.

Karl Ackerman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Your latest run rate, all-flash array revenues are near a record of $2.9 billion and your year-over-
year growth exceeded most peers. And so I was hoping you could provide some parameters, at least
qualitatively, around your fiscal '22 expectations for all-flash array growth? And maybe how the mix of
your installed base plays into those expectations?

George Kurian
CEO & Director

Listen, I feel really good about our flash business. We are focused, differentiated and executing in the
market. I think our strong position in the sweet spot of the storage industry, which is the midrange part of
the market, is clearly evident, and it is affecting the growth rates of our competitors. We have taken share
for the last several quarters, and we see every confidence that we will continue to do that going forward.

What we said at the Analyst Day was that over the next few years, the all-flash array market will grow
at about 7.5% CAGR, and we expect to outpace that this coming year. We expect that the storage
industry will grow around 4%, and our revenue picture expects us to outpace the growth of the storage
industry overall. So we feel really good. And ONTAP 9.9 coming out gives us even more confidence in our
differentiation.

Kris Newton
VP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations

All right. Well, thank you, Karl. That's our final question. So I'll hand it over to George for some closing
remarks.

George Kurian
CEO & Director

Thanks, Kris. In closing, we delivered a great end to a strong year. And we are well positioned as we move
into fiscal year '22. I want to reiterate that our public cloud business is at a scale where it is contributing
meaningfully to revenue and billings growth. And the innovations we deliver to our hybrid cloud business
will support continued product revenue growth.

In fiscal year '22, we expect to grow the top line, deliver operating leverage and generate significant free
cash flow, all while investing in growth initiatives. I am excited by and confident in our ability to capitalize
on the industry transitions and the market opportunities ahead. I look forward to speaking with you again
next quarter.
