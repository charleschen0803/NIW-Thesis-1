Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Zions Bancorporation's Third
Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Webcast.

[Operator Instructions]

Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded.

[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott.
Sir, please go ahead.

James R. Abbott
Senior VP of Investor Relations & External Communications

Thank you, Latif, and good evening, everyone. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2020
third quarter earnings.

I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although
actual results may differ materially.

Additionally, the earnings release, related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several
references to non-GAAP measures. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or
the slide deck on Slide 2, dealing with forward-looking information and the presentation of non-GAAP
measures, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the full earnings release as
well as the supplemental slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the
slides during this call.

Let me introduce our agenda today. First, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Harris Simmons, will
provide a high-level overview of key financial performance. President and Chief Operating Officer, Scott
McLean, will then provide comments on our recent strengths in certain strategic areas. Keith Maio and
Michael Morris, our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, respectively, will review the credit condition
of the loan portfolio.

Finally, Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will conclude by providing additional detail on Zions'
financial condition. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour.

[Operator Instructions]

With that, I will turn the time over now to Harris Simmons.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Thanks very much, James. We welcome all of you to our call this evening.

Beginning on Slide 3, which is a summary of several key financial highlights. We just note that we
are generally pleased with the overall results for the quarter. Our earnings per share are back to a
level experienced throughout much of 2019 although revenue has declined somewhat from what we
experienced then. Our noninterest expense has declined moderately, resulting in adjusted pre-provision
net revenue, excluding the charitable contribution we made during the quarter of pre-provision net
revenue of $297 million, which is actually somewhat stronger than the quarterly average in 2019.

Additionally, the diluted shares have declined by about 17% from the levels in early 2019, which is the
result of share repurchases prior to the pandemic and the expiration of warrants earlier this year.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19,
2020

We resolve to enter whatever downturn was on the horizon with strong relative and absolute capital ratios.

At 10.4% common equity Tier 1 capital and an allowance for credit losses relative to loans of 1.9%, we
still have one of the strongest capital ratios within the large regional bank space.

Another major positive this quarter is the loan deferral and delinquency story, which Keith and Michael will
address in greater detail shortly. And I'll just highlight that with what we are seeing in real-time economic
data such as credit and debit card spending, various business and consumer sentiment indicators
and relative linked quarter stability in loan rates within the industries' most adversely affected by the
pandemic, all of these indicators support our conclusion that our allowance for credit losses in the second
quarter was at an appropriate level for -- at the end of the quarter was at an appropriate level for the third
quarter, rather.

That resulted in a provision for credit losses that was generally consistent with our net charge-offs in the
third quarter, a decline of 67% from the prior quarter.

Slide 4 shows our earnings per share. Both the second and third quarters had larger onetime items in the
noninterest expense line that were very similar in size, $28 million in a pension termination charge in the
second quarter and $30 million for a charitable contribution, which we had noted earlier and that's made
possible by our success with the PPP program in the third quarter.

The largest single difference between the second and third quarters was the provision expense, which
explains about $0.52 per share, the $0.67 differential. Fee income was also noted as a meaningful
contributing factor, which if one excludes the securities gains and losses and credit valuation allowance in
both quarters, contributed an increase of about $0.06 per share.

Turning to Slide 5. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $267 million in the third quarter. And as
noted, if you further adjust this for the charitable contribution related to the PPP program of $30 million,
it would have been $297 million or a decline of $3 million compared to the prior quarter. You can see the
outsized provisions relative effect on profitability on the chart on the right, especially when compared with
provisions in periods prior to the pandemic.

On Slide 6, we highlight the balance sheet profitability metrics, with the outlook for credit quality being
more stable than in the prior 2 quarters. Profitability has improved to a level that I wouldn't necessarily
label as totally satisfactory, but certainly much better than what we experienced in the prior 2 quarters.

With that, I'm going to turn a little bit of time over to Scott McLean, our President and Chief Operating
Officer. Scott?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Thank you, Harris, and good evening to everyone. Let me direct you to Slide 7.

Over the last few months, we've spoken frequently about our success with the Small Business
Administration's Paycheck Protection Program. As noted on this page, we ranked as the ninth largest
originator of PPP loans in the country. Yet when measured by deposits, Zions is the 37th largest financial
institution in the country.

Our share of PPP originations was 3.6x our deposit market share and 25% to 50% of the units or dollars,
depending on what you're measuring of the 3 largest participants, which were banks that were -- that are
approximately 35x our size. This significant outperformance was a function of our history as a bank for
small businesses and our ability to combine the efforts of 1,500 plus customer-facing bankers with best-
in-class technology and workflow processes.

This effort helped stabilize more than 47,000 businesses that employed hundreds of thousands of workers.
If measured by the number of loans rather than by balance, about 75% of these loans were less than
$100,000 in size.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19,
2020

So now we're engaged in the forgiveness aspect of the program. At this point, more than 10,000
customers, representing about $1.7 billion of volume have applied for forgiveness. We have a highly
controlled process for handling the forgiveness process, and we've engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to
assist this.

We've also chosen to be an active participant in the Main Street program, although initial volume is light
as has been reported across the country. From a financial perspective, the short-term benefit of the PPP
program will serve as a meaningful cushion against the abrupt decline in interest rates and the economic
volatility caused by the pandemic.

As a longer-term benefit, we have more than 14,000 new-to-bank PPP customers with whom our affiliates
are laser-focused on building deep relationships.

Particularly, timely with this calling effort is the introduction of what we call Treasury Select, which is a set
of small business treasury management products, offering a simplified version of the nationally recognized
treasury management products, we have provided to larger businesses for years. Perhaps of greater
importance is the 33,000 plus existing customers who received a PPP loan, most of which were previously
deposit-only customers with whom we can now build an even more meaningful relationship.

This focused calling effort by our bankers is also being reinforced by a branding campaign that highlights
our PPP results as well as our long-standing commitment to small businesses.

Moving on to Slide 8, shifting gears a bit. A few years ago, we set out to significantly expand our
capabilities and profitability in the residential mortgage area. As a result of this enhanced focus, lower
interest rates and our ability to gain market share, 2020 mortgage production has been considerably
stronger than the year ago period. You can see this on Slide 8.

Slide 8 notes several key successes related to the rollout of what we refer to as Zip Mortgage, our digital
customer-facing application process.

This digital application will verify employment, pull internal revenue service information and pull all of the
customers' bank statements, the 3 largest frustrations among mortgage applicants. This new process has
also allowed us to reduce our turn times by 25% and improve our customer service levels.

Originations exceeded $1 billion in the prior quarter. And despite the moderation in the refinancing wave
in the third quarter, we still funded more than $920 million of residential mortgage loans in that quarter.
Correspondingly, selling income is serving to offset pandemic-related fee declines, fee softness that we are
experiencing in other areas.

Credit metrics remain consistent with our traditional practice, and they are provided on the bottom of
this slide. Residential mortgage lending continues to be a natural for us, particularly given our large small
business customer base.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Thanks very much, Scott. And before we turn the time over to Keith, I'd just like to take just a moment to
express my thanks on behalf of all of our shareholders to Ed Schreiber who's been our Chief Risk Officer
for the past number of years and who retired on October 1.

Ed was really instrumental in helping us to strengthen our risk program and has just done a phenomenal
job, and we really want to wish him all the best. He's going to continue to do a little bit of consulting for us
for the next few quarters. But he'll have a lot more time to snowboard and do some things that he loves
to do. He's succeeded by Keith Maio, who many of you know, Keith served for several years as the CEO of
our National Bank of Arizona operation and for the past few years, has been our Chief Banking Officer, and
he's really just an exceptional banker and will do a wonderful job in this new role as our Chief Risk Officer.
So Keith, let me turn a few minutes over to you.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19,
2020

Thank you, Harris. And I'll begin my comments this evening on Slide 9. Because of the relatively minimal
credit risk within PPP loans and because prior quarters would not be comparable, we have presented the
credit quality ratios, excluding PPP loans. Classified loans this quarter increased to 3.4% of total non-PPP
loans from 3.1% in the prior quarter.

And nonperforming assets, including loans that are 90 days past due, increased 5 basis points to 79 basis
points of non-PPP loans and other real estate owned from 74 basis points in the prior quarter.

About 1/5 of the nonaccruals are within the energy sector, which is a similar proportion to a prior quarter
and hotels, restaurants and recreational businesses also accounted for about 1/5 of nonaccrual loans,
up from about 10% of nonaccruals in the prior quarter. The remainder of nonaccrual loans is distributed
across various industries.

Net charge-offs bumped up in the third quarter to 43 basis points from 26 basis points last quarter. About
1/3 of gross charge-offs were attributable to the energy industry. Retail businesses were also a significant
contributor to this quarter's charge-offs.

As we review classified nonaccrual and delinquent loan ratios, it's worth repeating what we've said
in various investor meetings, including our Investor Day in February. In the past, Zions' generally
experienced much lower loss rate relative to problem loans than most of our peers. Like most other banks,
we underwrite loans based upon stressed cash flow assumptions, but we typically secure the loan with
collateral, for example, real estate or other business and personal assets.

We also require personal guarantees on most of our loans, and many borrowers have external sources of
capital that is available to support their investment during a period of difficulty, particularly if the problem
is considered to be transitory.

During the global financial crisis, the value of collateral plunged, but in this pandemic, many assets are
perhaps somewhat softer, but generally holding up and in the case of residential property, the values have
generally increased. The dark-blue columns on the chart have been quite small relative to the classified
ratios. And when compared to other large regional banks, Zions typically screens in the best or lowest
loss-severity quartile.

I might also highlight the time series of the chart to help put this recession in perspective. We've included
the average of those same credit ratios in the global financial crisis, '08 and '09, and during the oil and
gas downturn, '15 and '16. Although we are not yet declaring mission accomplished, with a strong risk
management infrastructure, the preparations we made to prepare the portfolio in advance for a downturn
and the significant support of the government relief provided to consumers and businesses, the credit
deterioration has been much less than we might have expected it to be.

When comparing the classified loan ratio during the global financial crisis to the level today, we are
experiencing only about 1/4 of the level of problem loans.

Moving to Slide 10. We and most other banks engaged very early in granting payment deferrals and
payment modifications. We did not broadly reach out to customers with an offer to defer a payment, but
we granted such deferrals liberally if we were requested so by a customer. At June 30, loans on payment
deferral status were 6.3% of non-PPP loans. While at September 30, that same ratio was just 0.6%, less
than half of which were re-deferrals.

The next question one might ask is how are delinquencies now that loans have come off deferral. On the
right side of the chart, showing total loans that are delinquent by 30 days or more, which declined 0.2
since June. Of these loans that had been granted a payment deferral at one point and have since come off
deferral, only 1% of those or slightly more than $40 million are delinquent in their payment by 30 days
or more. We attribute part of this to risk management practices we've employed and also to our early
outreach calling program.

Next, I'll turn the call over to Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer. Michael?

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19,
2020

Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Thanks, Keith. I'll start on Slide 11. We introduced an earlier variation of this in April, which we further
refined the definition of what is now included, and we've reviewed the performance of these sub
industries. But this is relatively the same chart that you've seen in prior quarters, the high-risk COVID
categories.

The industries are represented here are the ones that have the greatest risk of default, with a weighted
average risk rate of 9.2 on a 10 scale, with worse grades than 10 being the regulatory grades that you
would expect, special mention, substandard nonaccrual, doubtful. But I would like to reemphasize a point
that Keith has made about collateral, the probability of default grade is not necessarily predictive of the
loss-given default.

As you can see in the bottom 4 lines of the chart on the right side of the page, the collateral coverage
is good for this $4-plus billion of loans, with 98% being covered by collateral, most of the time by real
estate, with roughly a 52% median loan-to-value ratio, with only 3% of the loans having LTV ratios
greater than 90%.

Slide 12 shows the same 3 groupings that we've highlighted on previous slide in a time series. The top
left chart shows loan balances and columns with the weighted average risk grade shown in the 3 lines
where the elevated risk portfolio experienced general stability since June, which you can see on the light-
blue line, where it does show stability and flattening out in Q3. The oil and gas portfolio experienced a
deterioration of 0.2 on risk grade, the rest of the portfolio experienced general stability.

It's worth noting that the probability of default between grades is not linear. For example, the probability
of default for grade 10 loan, the worst class grade in our grading range, is significantly greater than a
grade 9 loan, et cetera. The elevated risk portfolio has a weighted average risk grade of 9.2 while the
other portfolio, the other being the rest of the commercial and consumer book, has a grade of 7.0. The
loan grades shown here do not reflect the loss-given default estimations, although the combination of the
2 is one of the more significant drivers of the allowance for credit loss.

The top right chart shows the trend in classified and nonaccrual loans, with the classified ratio being the
larger number and the nonaccrual ratio being the smaller number within each bar. The relative stability
of the other loans nonaccrual ratio, which again represents 87% of the total non-PPP loan portfolio, is
encouraging.

On the bottom left, you can see the utilization rates of the various portfolio segments. We continue to be
encouraged with the credit implications of the COVID-19 elevated-risk line utilization rate falling yet again,
down to 29% from 34% last quarter.

Finally, in the bottom right, you can see the net charge-offs related to these groups. The oil and gas
portfolio tends to experience elevated charge-offs, and in some cases, later recoveries. And that is the
case for a few charge-offs that we've seen in the recent past, including situations where we receive equity
for debt that may be forgiven or charged off.

I would note that we reduced the allowance for credit loss on this portfolio, the oil and gas portfolio, in
the third quarter relative to the prior quarter due to continued reports from line bankers, credit partners
and borrowers that the companies are faring better than previously expected. There are several factors
that contributed to that decision, beginning with roughly 25% to 30% rebound in the price of oil across
the futures curve as well as spot price improvement, favorable developments with wells that have been
shut as many are back into production and a number of prepackaged bankruptcies as the second liens
and senior debt will be whittled away through the prepackaged bankruptcy and will end up with borrowing
bases in the upstream oil and gas portfolio that are totally conforming.

Not shown on the page, but perhaps worth noting our delinquencies. Keith already highlighted the
substantial improvement in delinquencies. I might just add that the loans within the COVID-19 elevated-
risk category had a somewhat higher 30-day or more past-due delinquency rate than the overall portfolio
at about 1.1%.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19,
2020

Additionally, we feel that the small and micro-sized business loans within our portfolio are weathering the
storm reasonably well. For example, commercial loans with commitments less than $50,000, which by unit
count, are significant and the company have a delinquency rate of just 106 which is about the same as it
was a year ago, which was 102.

So taking a step back and considering all the factors as a whole, from the improvement in delinquencies
and deferrals, the relative stability within the COVID-19 elevated-risk grade portfolio, the outlook for oil
and gas loans improving for reasons cited previously, good levels of consumer and commercial spending
as compared to the year ago level, to list a few, we are more and more comfortable with the credit
situation than we were just a few months ago. Still, we will remain vigilant and disciplined as always.

So I'll now turn the time over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer. Paul?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Michael, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 13, which details our allowance for
credit losses.

On the top left, you can see the recent trend in our ACL. The total ACL was $917 million at September 30.
Excluding the allowance on PPP loans, the ACL was $915 million or about 1.9% of non-PPP loans. On the
right side of Page 13, we described the factors leading to the ACL change in the most recent quarter.

The bar chart on the bottom right shows the broad categories of change. The first bar represents the
change in forecast category. The $50 million increase from the prior quarter is our estimate of the change
in credit losses due to modest changes in the economic forecast employed in our loss models. Credit
quality factors represented by the middle bar include risk-grade migration and specific reserves against
loans, which, when combined, ad $24 million to the ACL when compared to the prior quarter.

Finally, portfolio changes, driven by non-PPP loan balances declining, the aging of the portfolio and other
similar factors generated a $71 million reduction in the ACL. Ultimately, the ACL was relatively stable when
compared to the prior quarter.

Slide 14 shows an overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart on the left
depicts recent trends in both. The net interest margin in the white boxes has compressed in the current
quarter relative to the prior quarter. This is attributable primarily to loan yields moving lower, which
adversely affected the margin by 12 basis points, reflecting the downward shift across the yield curve
over the past several quarters and a greater weighting or mix of lower-yielding PPP loans relative to total
earning assets.

The second most significant factor in the linked quarter margin compression was the composition and
yields of the money market and securities portfolio. Due to the increase in average deposits of $3.5 billion
and with average loans only increasing $725 million, the surplus cash went to paying down borrowings
and increasing short-term investments, which increased $1.5 billion from the prior quarter. At a yield
of just 25 basis points, the increasing levels of short-term investments has a dilutive effect on the net
interest margin, but not necessarily on net interest income. Net interest income contracted by $8 million
or 1% on a linked-quarter basis.

With the average earning asset balance decreasing by -- I'm sorry, the average earning asset balance
increasing by 3%, the decline in net interest income was largely driven by the decline in loan yields
and the change in earning asset mix described earlier. Notably, the $6.8 billion in PPP loans on average
contributed $52 million of interest revenue in the quarter. As an important note, late in the quarter, we
modified outstanding PPP loans to a term of 5 years, which is consistent with the terms of PPP loans made
later in the process.

This action will reduce the yield on PPP loans to about 1.7% in the fourth quarter and beyond unless --
and this is an important consideration, the loans undergo a forgiveness or other prepayment event. As
a reminder, the net fees attached to PPP loans serve as the mechanism to augment the PPP loan yields
beyond the 1% stated coupon and as such, are amortized over the life of the PPP loans.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 19,
2020

Upon maturity or forgiveness, these fees will accelerate into net interest income. As Scott illustrated
earlier, measured by volume, we have received an application for forgiveness on about 25% of our PPP
loans.

Slide 15 highlights loan and deposit growth and breaks them down by both rate and volume. Relative to
the prior quarter, average PPP loans increased $1.8 billion, as depicted by the lightly shaded bar, while
average non-PPP loans declined $1 billion or 2%. Because the PPP loan yield was only 3% in the third
quarter, this remixing of the portfolio contributed to linked quarter loan yield compression.

Shifting to the chart on the right and funding. Average total deposits increased 5.6% over the prior
quarter, not annualized. Many banks, including Zions, are reporting relatively strong deposit growth, one
could speculate that this may be attributable to the significant fiscal and monetary programs designed to
support the economy during the pandemic. The cost of deposits declined to 11 basis points from 15 basis
points in the prior quarter.

Turning to Slide 16. Our balance sheet sensitivity has increased as benchmark interest rates have fallen.
We are comfortable with the increase in rate sensitivity because we believe the risk to lower interest rates
is limited. The recent increase in short-term investments may be deployed into longer duration securities
over the next several quarters, which would likely impact overall balance sheet sensitivity. The charts
on the right show the interest rate reset profile of our loan portfolio and include additional detail on the
interest rate swap book.

On the lower -- on the upper right, the volumes, maturities and associated fixed rates for the swaps used
to hedge our floating rate loans are shown, while on the bottom right, we see a highlight of our loan
repricing characteristics. Loans with longer maturities are expected to reprice downward if the current
interest rate environment does not change.

On Slide 17, customer-related fees increased $9 million from the prior quarter, reflecting increased
residential mortgage, retail deposit and card activity.

Noninterest expense, shown on Slide 18, increased to $442 million in the third quarter. However, as
discussed elsewhere, after normalizing for the $30 million charitable contribution, the total noninterest
expense was $412 million in the quarter. Year-to-date, on this basis, adjusted noninterest expense is
running about 4% lower in 2020 when compared to 2019. This view is intended to illustrate that we have
been able to effectively manage costs to help offset the decline in revenue while continuing to invest in our
business, as Harris noted at the beginning of the call.

While we have suspended forward-looking guidance given the nature of the current operating
environment, we are encouraged by the continued strength of our balance sheet and have been impressed
by the creativity and resiliency demonstrated every day by our colleagues, our customers and our
communities.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, please open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rochester of Compass Point.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

You guys had some great deferral trends this quarter, and you really didn't move the reserve around that
much. But just wondering where the reserve sat on that COVID-at-risk bucket at this point, that 8.4% of
loans.

And I know Moody's includes more stimulus in at least one of their scenarios. So just wondering if you
guys assume more stimulus as well. And if we don't get that, if you have a sense for what the sensitivity is
to the reserve you have on that bucket or at least the PPP customers in that bucket? Or overall, that would
be great.

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Yes, this is Michael, Dave. I'll take that.

The reserve is fairly substantial on the COVID-19 portfolio. So we didn't move that down much.

The PPP loans don't carry much of a reserve at all. We don't consider there to be a lot of credit risk on that
book, given the federal guarantee, the 100% guarantee.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Yes. No. I guess I was just talking about the customers that you already have loans outstanding
that also have PPP loans for you guys if there are any sensitivity there. If you don't get to re-up on the
PPP or if they don't get more funds through that, if there's any sensitivity there?

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Well, there's definitely a correlation. There will be a correlation. And on the larger exposures, I would
not expect there to be a huge correlation. On the smaller exposures, like some of the small business
and micro loans that we talked about earlier, there will definitely be a relationship if stimulus 2.0 doesn't
deliver to the small business owner.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

In terms of quantifying that at risk reserve ratio, do you happen to have what that is? I know it's
substantial. But just curious how large that is.

Michael Morris

I think we'll have to get back to you on that.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I might elucidate. It's Harris. I think it's useful to note that if we take kind of the smallest of those
loans, under $50,000, we have -- it's relatively -- it's very small outstandings. It's about $165 million in

outstanding, exclusive of some card balances, but those balances are also very small. So it's not -- it's just
not a big portfolio. When you get a little larger, you get up to under $250,000, we've got a little over $1
billion outstanding. So as you get -- as the business get a little larger, the exposures get larger.

But I think it's really these micro businesses that are probably most at risk, and it's not a big exposure for
us. And so far, the delinquencies, even after most of them would have been expected to have exhausted
their PPP funding, are actually holding in really well compared to where they were even just a year ago. So
I would agree with Michael. There'll be some impact, but I don't think it's going to be particularly severe
for us.

David Patrick Rochester
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then maybe just one more quick one on the margin. Given you've got securities
reinvestment rates here at the 1.2% level. You've got a little chunk of loans here that's still scheduled to
reprice this year and more next year. I was just wondering, do you have enough leverage on the cost side?
I know you can reduce CD cost, but can you do anything else in the borrowings? Can you do anything else
in the interest-bearing core deposit side to offset that pressure? Or do you think that the NIM inevitably
has to move lower from here, ex liquidity and the PPP fees that are coming?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Paul. The -- there is limited -- on the liability side, there is limited
opportunity to continue to move that down. There's a little bit of opportunity on deposit rates. There are
CDs. You can see on the book, there are CDs that have term rates attached to them that have been put on
over the course of last year. Those will run off and out over the course of time. And then obviously, we will
limit our borrowing because we're in a sort of a net overfunded position. And that will reduce the overall
cost of borrowing.

But really, the repricing of assets -- I would expect the repricing of assets to exceed the repricing of the
liabilities. And we've been talking about margin compression here for the last several quarters, and that
we're seeing that now. And I would expect to continue to see that at least in the near term.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Maybe just staying on that point, what is the average yield on the new loans that you actually added in
3Q? And could that new loan yield compress further from here?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, I'm not going to quantify the new loan yield necessarily, but the yield is a function of 2 things, rate
and spread -- rate and credit spread, right? And that given where the yield curve is today, the only thing
that's going to create additional compression on loan yields will be either a change in credit spread by
the market repricing credit spreads lower or by the composition of our portfolio change. So for example,
you've seen over the course of the last 5 years, commercial real estate maybe loans have grown a little
slower and municipal loans have grown a little faster. And there's a differential in pricing there as there is
also a differential in risk.

But by and large, my personal expectation is that I don't think that new loans being put on are going to
look a lot different from loans that may have been added this quarter, PPP loans being the exclusion. And
so I think what you're going to see the margin compression is really going to be driven by the change in
yield associated with older, longer-term fixed rate loans running off and being replaced by newer loans. So
it's really a function of the flatness of the curve.

2020

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

No, I understood, Paul. And I guess that's the reason for the question, which I was trying to get a
magnitude of how much the yield differential is between that existing portfolio and then the new loans.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Right. And what I'm saying is that it's hard to be very specific about that because there are so many other
things that can impact that. I'm hopeful that we can get back to a day soon where we can start to provide
some forward-looking guidance. But the environment right now is just so uncertain.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. Maybe asked a different way. If we just look at total, the decline in loan yields on Slide 15, it looks
like it's down about 15 basis points. I guess some of that is the PPP, and I'm sure it looks like it's going to
compress further with the change that you made to the PPP program. But if we think about 15 basis points
a quarter, is that a reasonable decline in loan balances -- or loan yields going forward?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, as you said, and I think we do on Page 17 of our press release, I think we do a pretty decent
job of really trying to break out and provide as much granularity as possible for investors to know and
understand how the portfolio yield is changing. And so you can see that our commercial loans, for
example, excluding PPP, are down less than 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter from $405 million to
$396 million. So the PPP loans clearly have had an outsized impact on yield. And I would encourage you
to look at that page, Page 17, because I think you can get a pretty good indication of how loans have
changed last quarter.

What's going to happen is that over time, you're going to see fewer and fewer loans repricing in any given
quarter. And I think we do a decent job on Page 16 of the earnings slide showing the maturity profile of
our loan portfolio so that you can get a feel for kind of how many -- how many of those loans are repricing
in any given period over the course of the next 5 years or so. Hopefully, that's helpful.

Kenneth Allen Zerbe
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

It is very helpful, yes. And if I can just change topics really quick, but one last question. It looks like
expenses, if we exclude the contribution, did run a little bit higher than recent history. How much of that
relates to the additional PPP expenses? And should it remain at that level going forward?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Well, as I said -- I -- if you -- as I said in my prepared remarks, if you exclude that -- if you look at
adjusted expenses and you look at 2019 and 2020, and you exclude the $30 million associated with that
charitable contribution, our expenses are down 4% year-over-year. And I think that's largely -- I think
that's pretty indicative of the current expense run rate.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

I just note that we did -- yes, we did spend a little more in the quarter. We mentioned we've done kind
of a branding campaign just trying to reinforce in businesses' minds that we're a good bank for business.
And we spent about $5 million in the quarter on that campaign. So that's -- that produced a little bit of
additional bump, but I wouldn't expect you'll see a decline.

Our next question comes from the line of Peter Pancari of Evercore ISI.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

It's John Pancari. So a question on the loan growth front. I know you're -- you've given us a lot of color on
the NIM side. Just trying to back into how this could impact spread revenue. So on the loan growth side,
we saw some pretty good declines on end-of-period balances in most areas. And just given the backdrop
right now around commercial demand, I guess, just can you help us think about how you expect loan
balances to traject from here? Is it fair to assume ongoing declines?

Scott J. McLean
President, COO & Director

Yes. John, this is Scott McLean. We're going to continue to see softness in total loan balances. That
shouldn't be a big surprise with the level of economic activity. And quite frankly, it's what you would
expect during this time, as you know, obviously. And so the weakness, the softness we're seeing in C&I,
if you look back at that slide is in the appendix and it's Slide 22. The weakness we're seeing in C&I is just
what you would expect. It's -- revenues are down for our C&I clients and consequently, their working
capital requirements are less. And they're borrowing less, building liquidity.

And so really, it's just softness across the C&I spectrum. But naturally -- but we're also seeing softness in
1-4 Family and HELOCs, our residential products, principally because of the refinancing boom that's going
on. So I think you're going to continue to see it at sort of the rates we're experiencing today. And then
when the economy does start to turn, whatever that is, I think we're going to see a pretty nice rebound
with a fair amount of pent-up activity coming back. I think people are ready to get back to work.

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. All right, Scott. That's helpful. And then on -- separately, on the credit front, just -- in looking at
charge-offs, we saw a pretty good increase this quarter. And I just want to first confirm, fair to assume
that we're still going to see upside pressure? I'm assuming you would expect that here. And then if you
have maybe any color on when do you think charge-offs could peak. If you could just give us a little bit of
insight there, whether you've factored that into your outlook and when that could be?

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Sure, John. This is Michael. I'll take that question. Yes. We had several credits that kind of tipped over in
Q3 that were already a little troubled. You could say the same about a few industries, like the restaurant
industry going into COVID already had some stress. So in some of our numbers are some of those credits
that were already in workout.

And then the market softened in the secondary market. So the note sale world changed pretty
dramatically. Can't really predict what we're going to see going forward. You just -- you don't know. But
the bulk of net charge-offs, I don't think we're going to see this year.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

And I think it's fair to say that there's just -- there's nothing material that's kind of living on the radar
screen in terms of larger credits that I'm aware of anyway, Michael, that's...

John G. Pancari
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Got it. Got it. And related to that, just my last question, just -- is it fair to assume then that given
all that you factored into your reserve and is it fair to assume those charge-offs rise that we should see
some reserve releases as we go or at least declined in the overall reserve balance aside from any new
reserves for loan growth?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

I'll jump in on that, John. The -- as you know, the reserve under -- in CECL land is based on so many sort
of various items. All other things equal, generally speaking, our reserve is set to our best expectation for
where we think losses are going to occur over the course of the life of the loan portfolio. And so without a
change in expectations or outlook, it would be hard to speculate on when we may or may not see reserve
growth or releases.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Moss of B. Riley Securities.

Stephen M. Moss
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just following up on credit. I believe you guys mentioned earlier that there's a high proportion of NPLs are
tied to hotels and restaurants. Just wondering, was that a similar driver in the criticized loans as well?

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Yes. I wouldn't say -- this is Michael. I wouldn't say one industry stands out over the other outside of
those 2, hospitality and full service restaurants, quick service restaurants are faring quite well. But I would
not say that there are other industries that really stand out. They do in terms of criticized and classified,
but in terms of forecasting net charge-offs, there really aren't other industries that jump out other than
the COVID-19 heightened-risk industries that we pointed out on these slides.

Stephen M. Moss
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And in terms of just curiosity, what are you seeing for activity -- in business activity at the hotel/
motel exposure you have?

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Well, I'll speak generally to what we're hearing from the street, not necessarily our exposure. I mean our
exposure is quite a mixed bag. We have some high-end. We have some low end. We have hospitality loans
that are in -- mostly in our footprint, if not almost exclusively in our Western footprint.

And we're seeing leisure and tourism pick up a little bit. We're seeing some of the hotels that we have
in the recreational markets. And I'll call those markets like Park City, Zion National Park, Scottsdale, a
few select markets in Colorado in the mountains, some coastal hospitality, doing well. The business and
convention hotels are struggling. Occupancy rates getting back to the 30%, 40% range, where the tourism
is up somewhat back to pre-COVID, in many cases, 60% occupancy, 70%.

September were higher than they were a year ago, which I found quite amazing. People are returning to
kind of outdoor, kind of the outdoors these recreation areas, just to underscore what Michael is saying.

Stephen M. Moss
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful. And then if I get one last one. Just on capital here, a little bit of an uptick in your
CET1 ratio again. And I know you're getting deposit growth and so your leverage ratio plus with PPP
leverage ratio a little tighter. But just kind of what are your thoughts about the potential for share
repurchases in the future?

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

Paul, do you want to -- I mean, I'll just say, we're in favor of them. Well, yes. I mean we're -- it may be
still a little early, but I'm hoping that if we can demonstrate, the credit remains in pretty good shape. And
we can keep PPNR in relatively decent condition. I hope we'll be back in a position to be able to resume
that as we get into next year. But it's too early to probably call that yet.

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

And I'll just add, as I think you know, we are rerunning our models with the stress tests provided to the
CCAR banks. And so stress testing is a very large component of our capital management exercises. So
we're going through that, but I think we all feel pretty good about the level of capital that we have. And to
the extent the economic outlook becomes more certain, back to John's question about the allowance for
credit losses, there's -- a lot of good things will happen as the economic outlook becomes more certain,
and I would expect that to include share buybacks. As Harris said, we're all in favor of them when the time
is right.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Paul, I just wanted to follow up on the restriking of the PPP loans. So if presuming that there is -- if you
didn't have forgiveness coming, is the only delta that we need to do is just to take that 3.03% yield,
change it to 1.7% and then have to restrike the amortization schedule out to -- was it 5 years instead
of the 2 years. So can you help us frame what that looks like in terms of just the contribution from PPP
before you get to forgiveness in the fourth quarter maybe versus that $52 million you saw in the third?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. So the -- I'm not sure what the $52 million is, I'd have to have a reminder on that. But the -- but
you're right, a little over 3% to about $170 million in the fourth quarter and under GAAP, it's a level yield
sort of accounting. So I would expect those -- all other things equal, those loans to be yielding $170
million for the remainder of their lives, again, before forgiveness.

And we outlined at the footnote of one of our pages, I don't remember which one. But in our slide deck,
we actually footnote that there's basically $140 million of capitalized fees that are going to come into
income over the life of the loans. And as I said in my prepared remarks, to the extent we do experience
loan forgiveness or prepayments, that would accelerate the revenue attached to that loan into current
quarter net interest income.

Right. So the $141 million is just the -- that's the all that's left? Or is that just the -- is that the all that's
left, if we just do the 4.5% over the book?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

That's a September 30 number, and that's sort of the fees, net of costs that are capitalized against the
loan. And again, the purpose of that is to augment -- the coupon is 1%. So the way the program was
designed, it was designed to augment the yield.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Right. So that's -- the yield would be in addition to the $141 million?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

The 1% coupon would be in addition to the $141 million that would amortize in. Yes.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Understood. Okay. Got it. And just one long question on the CRE side. Interesting that the CRE business
is actually growing for you guys and for a lot of other industry participants. Just wondering what you're
seeing in terms of is there a little bit of back to banks? Is it that projects are getting reopened that might
have been quiet? Just any color on what you're seeing inside the CRE business and if you expect that to
continue?

Michael Morris
Executive VP & Chief Credit Officer

Sure. Ken, this is Michael. I'll take that. A lot of what we have seen have been construction loans that
have converted to term. We don't -- we're not actively out looking at originating large CRE term loans
today, and we haven't been for several quarters. It's mostly conversion. And there's the occasional
acquisition that we'll finance, but the CRE activity has been fairly strong relative to the other food groups
of C&I and consumer, just overall.

We're monitoring collection rates of the different asset classes. We're seeing positive performance in
multifamily. CRE retail is a challenge, but we haven't seen material problems arise yet, collection rates
are on the way up in CRE retail. Industrial is in favor. We've seen quite a few industrial transactions. In
fact some of the growth that we've seen in CRE has come from the industrial asset class. And of course,
there are certain asset classes that we are pausing on, hospitality being probably the most notable. Is that
helpful?

James R. Abbott

Your next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet of UBS.

Brocker Clinton Vandervliet
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just in terms of capital, kind of philosophically, we've climbed the mountain, so to speak, with CECL,
continuing to build capital, 10.4% CET1, all that's looking good. On the back side of this, where do you
kind of place the bogey of the appropriate capital level, whether it's CET1 or some other metric?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

That's -- as we have tried to describe before we entered into 2020, the level of capital that we're trying to
achieve -- striving to achieve is really heavily predicated on the outcome of our loss models, which is why
we generally publish the results of our stress test, so that investors have some insight into that primary
mechanism for managing capital. But I would say coming into this year, we also said that we expected to
hold capital at a level that was kind of at or above peer medians, with the concept that we believe we've
got, on average, sort of lower balance sheet risk.

And if we can demonstrate lower risk in a modestly level -- a higher level of capital, we think that creates
a really good balance for shareholders. So I don't know that that's changed other than the environment
that's a lot more uncertainty -- uncertain. But I feel really good about how our balance sheet was
positioned coming into this environment.

Scott J. McLean

Jennifer, this is Scott. And we did see in the second quarter -- third quarter, as we noted, a nice
improvement in retail and business service charges as well as card. And so we had -- year-over-year had
experienced a pretty significant decline as has the industry. But for the first time, we saw a lot of rebound
in both retail and business service charges and in cards. So that's encouraging. And in terms of how we're
progressing so far here in October, it's too early to really provide any color on that.

Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.

Erika Najarian
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

One question. Conversations with investors prior to your reporting earnings indicated that the
underperformance of the stock really had to do with PPNR concerns and where that would reset to rather
than credit. And I guess, I just wanted to go back to some of the margin questions that were asked earlier
in the call. As we think about 2021 and normalized ROEs and ROAs for Zion and no change in the interest
rate environment, it seems like, Paul, you indicated that the NIM could go down to 2.9%-ish in the fourth
quarter, just based on doing quick math on your exchange with Ken Usdin. And then obviously, there's
a little bit of repricing still. Where -- I mean, where does the NIM bottom from here? Is it without any
change, major change in liquidity profile and interest rates and growth? Is it bottom around the 2.8%,
2.9% range?

Paul E. Burdiss
Executive VP & CFO

Erika, I can't be very specific, obviously, about where the NIM sort of bottoms out. But I think we have
been telegraphing for some time that we have been expecting margin compression. And we've seen that.
The mitigant will be balance sheet growth and loan growth. And clearly, we saw that with PPP loans that
grew pretty substantially here through the first couple of quarters. And as a result, we've had a pretty
decent cushion to what might otherwise have been a modestly declining sort of PPNR number.

So the key for us is being focused on loan growth and balance sheet growth. And that's -- at the end of
the day, as you know, it's a volume and rate conversation. And to the extent the interest environment is
so difficult, it's incumbent upon us to really offset that with loan growth where possible.

Harris Henry Simmons
Chairman & CEO

I might just add. I mean I think the -- there's also the very real possibility that you're going to see around
2 of PPP in a smaller scale and for more impacted industries. But that could provide sort of another kind
of a booster shot and prolong this somewhat. But it's -- the PPP at the end of the day is a temporary
phenomenon. And underlying that is this very real pressure, and I think that's going to be with us for a
little while.
