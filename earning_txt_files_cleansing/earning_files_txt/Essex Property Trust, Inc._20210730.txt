ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.

As a reminder: Today's conference call is being recorded. Statement made -- statements made on
this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current
expectations, assumptions and beliefs; as well as information available to the company at this time.
A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further
information about these risks can be found on the company's filing with the SEC.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael -- Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive
Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you.

Mr. Schall, you may begin.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call.

Angela Kleiman and Barb Pak will follow me with prepared remarks, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A.

On today's call, I'll start with our second quarter results, which were driven by a strengthening economy
and positive fundamentals that underlie a robust recovery on the West Coast. I'll also discuss the status of
reopening the West Coast economies and related factors, concluding with an overview of the West Coast
apartment transaction markets and investments.

Our second quarter results were ahead of our initial expectations entering the year as the economic
recovery from the pandemic occurred faster than we expected. With a strong economy and high
vaccination rates, we are now confident that the worst of the pandemic-related impacts are behind
us. As noted on previous calls, our strategy during the pandemic was to maintain high occupancy and
scheduled rent, both necessary for a rapid recovery. To that end, net effective rents surged during the
second quarter, along with year-over-year improvement in occupancy, other income and delinquency. The
recovery in net effective rents continued unabated in July. And we are now pleased to announce that July
net effective rents for the Essex portfolio have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels, with our suburban
markets leading the way, while the downtowns are improving but still generally below pre-pandemic
levels. Obviously, these higher rents will be converted into revenue as leases turn. And Angela will provide
additional details in a moment.

Having past the midpoint of 2021 and looking forward, we made a second set of positive revisions to
our West Coast market forecasts, which can be found on Page S-17 of the supplemental. Driving the
changes is an increase in 2021 GDP and job growth estimates to 7% and 5%, up from 4.3% and 3.2%,
respectively, from our initial forecasts. As a result, we now expect our average 2021 net effective rent
growth to improve to minus 0.9% from minus 1.9% from the beginning of the year. To put this into
perspective, consider that our net effective rents were down about 9% year-over-year in Q1 2021. Given
our current expectation of minus 0.9% rent growth for the year, year-over-year net effective market rents
are now forecasted to increase about 6% in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Cash delinquencies were up modestly on a sequential basis at 2.6% of scheduled rent for the quarter and
well above our 30-year average delinquency rate of 30 to 40 basis points. The American Rescue Plan of
2021 provides funding for emergency rental assistance, which was allocated to the states for distribution
to renters for pandemic-related delinquencies. During the second quarter, collections of delinquent rents
from the American Rescue Plan were negligible, as the pace of processing reimbursements has been
slow since the program launched in March. We expect that to improve in the coming months. We expect
delinquency rates to return to normal levels over time as more workers enter the workforce and eviction

protections lapse on September 30 in both California and Washington. At this point, only about $7 million
of the $55 million in delinquent rents shown on Page S-16 of the supplemental has been recorded as
revenue. Given uncertainty about the timing of collections, no additional revenues are contemplated in our
financial guidance.

Even with the approved job and economic outlook, the reopening process was gradual through the second
quarter, with full reopening declared in mid- and late June for California and Washington, respectively.
The unemployment rate was still 6.5% in the Essex markets as of May 2021, underperforming the
nation. Through Q2, we have regained about half of the jobs lost in the early months of the pandemic.
Employment in the Essex markets dropped over 15% in April 2020, and while job growth in our markets
outpaced the nation in the second quarter, we are still 7.9% below pre-pandemic employment compared
to 4.4% for the U.S. overall. We see the gap as an opportunity for growth to continue in the coming
months as we benefit from the full reopening of the West Coast economies. We believe that many workers
that exited the primary employment centers during pandemic-related shutdowns and work-from-home
programs will return as businesses reopen and resume expansion that was placed on hold during the
pandemic.

As we proceed through the summer months, we edge closer to the targeted office reopening dates set
by most large tech employers in early September. As recent reports about Apple and Google suggest,
the COVID-19 Delta variant could lead to temporary delays in this reopening process. Our survey of job
openings in the Essex markets for the largest tech companies continues to be very strong, as we report
33,000 job openings as of July, a 99% increase over last year's trough. New venture capital investment
has set a record pace this year, with Essex markets once again leading with respect to funds invested,
providing growth capital that supports future jobs. Generally, economic sectors that fell the furthest during
the pandemic are now positioned for the strongest recovery in the reopening process, led by restaurants,
hotels, entertainment venues, travel and filming. Return-to-office plans, which remained focused on hybrid
approaches, will continue to draw employees closer to corporate offices. Given that many workers won't
be required to be in the office on a full-time basis, we expect average commute distances to increase. As
we highlight on Page S-17.1 of our supplemental, this transition has already started in recent months,
as our hardest-hit markets in the Bay Area once again experienced net positive migration from beyond
the NorCal region. In particular, since the end of Q1, the submarkets surrounding San Francisco Bay have
seen positive net migration that represents 18% of total move-outs over the trailing 3 months compared
to minus 8% a year ago. These inflows are led by residents returning from adjacent metros such as
Sacramento and the Monterey peninsula; as well as renewed flow of recent graduates arriving from
college towns across the country, a notable positive turnaround from last year. In Seattle CBD, we've seen
similar or even stronger recent inflows and we're likewise experiences -- experiencing a strong market
rent recovery.

On the supply outlook, we provided our semiannual update to our 2021 forecasts on S-17 of the
supplemental with slight increases to 2021 supply, as COVID-related construction delays shifted
incremental units from late 2020 into 2021. We expect modestly fewer apartment deliveries in the second
half of 2021, with more significant declines in Los Angeles and Oakland. While it is still too early to
quantify, recent volatility in lumber prices and shortages for building materials may impact construction
starts and the timing of deliveries in subsequent years. Multifamily permitting activity in Essex markets
also continues to trend favorably, declining 200 basis points on a trailing 12-month basis as of May 2021
compared to the national average which grew 230 basis points. Median single-family home prices in
Essex markets continued upward in California and Seattle, [ growing ] 18% and 21%, respectively, on a
trailing 3-month basis. The escalating costs of homeownership combined with greater rental affordability
from the pandemic have increased the financial incentive to rent. We suspect these trends will continue,
given muted single family supply and limited permitting activity, and believe these factors will be a key
differentiator for our markets in the coming years compared to many U.S. markets with greater housing
supply.

Turning to apartment transactions. Activity has steadily accelerated since the start of the year, with the
majority of apartment trades occurring in the low- to mid-3% cap rate range based on current rents.
Generally, investors anticipate a robust rent recovery, especially in markets where current rents are
substantially below pre-pandemic levels. With the recent improvement in our cost of capital, we have

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

turned our focus once again to acquisitions and development while remaining disciplined with respect
to FFO accretion targets. With respect to our preferred equity program, we continue to see new deals,
although the market is becoming more competitive. Lower cap rates from pre-pandemic levels have
produced higher-than-anticipated market valuations, which in turn has resulted in higher levels of early
redemption.

That concludes my comments. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our COO, Angela Kleiman.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Thanks, Mike.

My comments today will focus on our second quarter results and current market dynamics.

With the reopening of the West Coast economy, the recovery has generated improvements in demand and
thus pricing power. Our operating strategy during COVID to favor occupancy while adjusting concessions
to maintain scheduled rents enabled us to optimize rent growth concurrent with the increase in demand,
resulting in same-store net effective rent growth of 8.3% since January 1. And most of this growth
occurred in the second quarter. A key contributor of this accomplishment is the fantastic job by our
operations team in responding quickly to this dynamic market environment.

While market conditions have improved rapidly, during our second quarter -- driving our second quarter
results to exceed expectations, I would like to provide some context for why sequential same-property
revenues declined by 90 basis points compared to the first quarter. The 2 major factors that drove this
decline were 50 basis points in delinquency and 50 basis points in concessions. Delinquency in the first
quarter was temporarily lifted by the onetime unemployment disbursements from the stimulus funds.
As expected in the second quarter, delinquency reverted back to 2.6% of scheduled rent versus the
2.1% in the first quarter. On concessions, the nominal amount increased from higher volume of leases
in the second quarter relative to the first quarter of this year. To be clear: Concessions in our markets
have declined substantially and are virtually nonexistent, except for select CBD markets. Our average
concession for the stabilized portfolio is under 1 week in the second quarter compared to over a week in
the first quarter and over 2 weeks in the fourth quarter. Although concessions have generally improved in
the second quarter, they remain elevated, ranging from 2.5 to 3 weeks in certain CBDs such as CBD L.A.,
San Jose and Oakland.

Given the extraordinary pandemic-related volatility in rents and concessions over the past 1.5 years, I
thought it would be insightful to provide an overview of the change in net effective rents compared to
pre-COVID levels. As of this June, our same-store average net effective rent compared to March of last
year was down by 3.1%. Since then, we have seen continued strength, and based on preliminary July
results, our average net effective rents are now 1.5% above pre-COVID levels. It is notable that this
1.5% portfolio average diverged regionally, with both Seattle and Southern California up 5.8% and 9.3%,
respectively, while Northern California has yet to fully recover, with net effective rents currently at 8%
below pre-COVID levels. On a sequential basis, net effective rents on new leases have improved rapidly
throughout the second quarter. And preliminary July rent increased 4.7% compared to the month of June,
led by CBD San Francisco and CBD Seattle, both up about 11%. Not surprisingly, these 2 markets were hit
hardest during the pandemic and are now experiencing the most rent growth.

Moving on to office development activities, which we view as an indicator of future job growth and,
accordingly, housing demand. In general, the areas along the West Coast with the greatest amount of
office development have been San Jose and Seattle. Currently, San Jose has 8.1% of total office stock
under construction, and similarly, Seattle has [ 7.7% ] of office stock under construction. Notable activities
include Apple leasing an additional 700,000 square feet. And LinkedIn announced recent plans to upgrade
their existing office in Sunnyvale. In the Seattle region, Facebook expanded their Bellevue footprint by
330,000 square feet. And Amazon announced 1,400 new web services jobs in Redlands. We expect in the
long term areas with higher office deliveries such as San Jose and Seattle will have capacity for greater
apartment supply without impacting rental rates. While these normal relationships were disrupted during
the pandemic, we anticipate conditions to normalize in the coming quarters.

Lastly, as the economic recovery continues to gain momentum, we have restarted both our apartment
renovation programs and technology initiatives, including actively enhancing the functionality of our
mobile leasing platform and SmartRent home automation.

Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Barb Pak.

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Angela.

I'll start with a few comments on our second quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance,
followed by an update on our investments and the balance sheet.

I'm pleased to report core FFO for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of the revised range
we provided during the NAREIT conference by $0.08 per share. The favorable results are primarily
attributable to stronger same-property revenues, higher commercial income and lower operating
expenses. Of the $0.08 beat, $0.03 relates to the timing of operating expenses and G&A spend, which is
now forecasted to occur in the second half of the year.

As Angela discussed, we are seeing stronger rent growth in our markets than we expected just a few
months ago. As such, we are raising the full year midpoint of our same-property revenue growth by 50
basis points to minus 1.4%. It should be noted this was the high end of the revised range we provided
in June. In addition, we have lowered our operating expense growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint
due to lower taxes in the Seattle portfolio. All of this results in an improvement in same-property NOI
growth by 80 basis points at the midpoint to minus 3%. Year-to-date, we have revised our same-property
revenue growth at the midpoint up 110 basis points and NOI by 160 basis points.

As it relates to full year core FFO, we are raising our midpoint by $0.09 per share to $12.33. This reflects
the stronger operating results partially offset by the impact of the early redemptions of preferred equity
investments, which I will discuss in a minute. Year-to-date, we have raised core FFO by $0.17 or 1.4%.

Turning to the investment market. As we've discussed on previous calls, strong demand for West Coast
apartments and inexpensive debt financing has led to sales and recapitalizations of several properties
underlying our preferred equity and subordinated loan investments, resulting in several early redemptions.
During the quarter, we received $36 million from an early redemption of a subordinated loan, which
included $4.7 million in prepayment fees, which have been excluded from core FFO. Year-to-date, we
have been redeemed on approximately $150 million of investments and expect that number could grow to
approximately $250 million by year-end. This is significantly above the high end of the range we provided
at the start of the year. However, this speaks to the high valuation apartment properties are commanding
today, which is good for Essex and the net asset value of the company.

As for new preferred equity investments, we have a healthy pipeline of accretive deals. And we are still
on track to achieve our original guidance of 100 million to 150 million in the second half of the year. As
a reminder: Our original guidance assumed new investments would match redemptions during the year.
However, the timing mismatch between the higher level of early reductions, coupled with funding of new
investments expected later this year, has led to an approximate $0.10 per share drag on our FFO for the
year.

Moving to the balance sheet. We remain in a strong financial position due to refinancing over 1/3 of
our debt over the past 1.5 years, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment to reduce our
weighted average rate by 70 basis points to 3.1% and lengthening our maturity profile by an additional
2 years. We currently have only 7% of our debt maturing through the end of 2023. Given our laddered
maturity schedule, limited near-term funding needs and ample liquidity, we are in a strong position to take
advantage of opportunities as they arise.
This concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Maybe starting, Barb, on the comments you just made on the preferred equity and the mezz loan. In
terms of the pipeline today, are you seeing any compression on yields or expected returns or any changes
to the computation there?

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Nick, this is Adam. To answer your question: Yes, we're seeing compression on cap rates. We're seeing it's
a much more competitive market now with proceeds going well above where we're typically comfortable
and rates going significantly below where we've been in the market. So to sum, yes, we are seeing
absolute compression on valuations.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So then in terms of the early redemptions that you've seen, I mean, is there a risk of further early
redemptions that could at least create an air pocket on the earnings side?

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

Nick, at -- this is Barb. At this point, I think we've factored that all in based on what we know today.
And we're already almost in August. So I think we've factored that into the current guidance, so I'm not
expecting any more redemptions at this point for the rest of the year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I wanted to just come back to sort of the trends that you're seeing in your markets. And I appreciate
all the color and commentary you gave us, but I'm hoping you can compare and contrast what you're
seeing in your market specifically versus maybe what someone typically thinks about in San Francisco,
Los Angeles, the broader West Coast urban markets. So specifically, are you seeing people still continue
to migrate in? Are you seeing people migrate out? What are those trends in your markets that give you
confidence relative to maybe some of the urban market trends?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Rich, it's Mike. I think I'll handle that one. And others may want to comment as well, but I think we feel
really very good about what's happening here, noted in my comments that we're fully recovered with
respect to market rents versus pre-pandemic levels while only recovered about half the jobs, so far. So
that -- I think that's a powerful place to start. And if we look around the West Coast, we feel great about
what's happening, and we expect good times to continue. The consumer is super optimistic. They've
saved money via COVID, versus COVID by not traveling and a variety of other things; millennials forming
households. And there's a lot of hiring here on the West Coast, so that's why we talk about the top 10 tech
companies and how many open positions they have. They've come a long way in the past year. And after

8

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

what we perceived as them pulling back mid-COVID on their expansion plans, I think that they're now
turning that corner or have turned that corner, hiring more people, pursuing things that they put on hold a
year ago. And so everything feels like it's in good order at this point in time.

As you go to the cities, the main driver of job growth at this point in time has been the recovery of
all the industries that have been so dramatically affected a year ago, including the leisure, hospitality,
restaurants, filming in Southern California, et cetera. And as we look at the world, we're looking at
whether we believe these industries are poised for future growth. And we think absolutely they are. We
think that we're in affluent areas. Affluent areas demand services. You're starting to see those services
come back in terms of restaurants and a variety of other areas, and so we see this turning around nicely.
And again I wouldn't have expected to be fully back with respect to rents at a time when we've only
recovered about half the jobs that we lost. Makes sense?

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, it makes perfect sense. I was just waiting to see if anyone else was going to follow up. That's perfect,
Mike. As we look forward and at the risk of asking you to guide, which I'm not, we had this obviously
pretty significant trough that came late last year and early this year. Is it sort of reasonable to think that
2022 will be the mirror image of that and then maybe we can -- we maybe even continue to push rents
above a normal trend over the medium term?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

It's a good question. And Barb will look at me very strangely if we start talking about '22 at this point
in time, so -- and you know how we are. We tend to be pretty careful in terms of guidance. And so we
don't want to go too far out there, but I would say that I would expect certainly the return to office to
be a good thing for the downtown locations because most of the top 10 tech companies or most of the
tech companies in general have announced a hybrid type of approach which means that people are going
to have to be closer to the offices to show up, let's say, plus or minus 3 times per week. As a result of
that, the people that moved to the hinterlands or the most suburban parts of our portfolio probably are
going to need to come back. And I think about Ventura. I don't want to pick on Ventura because it's done
great, but it's a long way on a commute pattern from Ventura into the -- where the jobs are in L.A. And
I don't think people are even going to want to do that 3 times a week. So I think that kind of frames the
dynamics. The -- those that had a year, given the pandemic, to make a different choice about where to
live, I think, will likely make a different choice going forward now that there's more clarity about what the
-- what companies are going to do with respect to their work-from-home or return-to-office programs.

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

And -- this is Barb. The only other thing I would add is leases we're signing today will have half the
impact to the rents this year to our rent roll, and that will carry forward into next year too. I mean, look,
[ as Angela has mentioned ], we had a strong July. And so that is going to only affect part of this year's
numbers, so [indiscernible].

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, I got it. I'm not sure that's entirely what I wanted, but I appreciate the response.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Well, maybe Barbara [indiscernible] -- that's -- sorry. Continue...

Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just kind of curious what your mark to market is in your portfolio; and maybe if you have it by region, like
Seattle, Northern California and Southern California.

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

[indiscernible]...

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Are we talking about loss-to-lease numbers?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Loss to lease.

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Yes.

Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes, loss to lease. Sorry.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Yes -- no, that's all right. That's all right. Well, in terms of the loss to lease, we actually are in a much
better position and in a level even better than pre COVID. So if we look at July loss to lease for the Essex
portfolio, it's now at 7.4%. And so -- and that, of course, varies: Seattle at the highest at about 12%,
Southern California in the middle of the pack at about 8% and Northern California at the lowest at about
3.5%.

Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay, awesome. And in your guidance range, what are you assuming, as far as like a recovery for the rest
of the year and rate for the Northern California market?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

I'll start. In the second half of the year, you -- as each -- we have to turn leases in order to impact our
same-store or our revenue. And so you -- as you get toward the end of the year, it becomes less relevant
and more relevant obviously next year. So take a transaction in October. You only have 3 months of that
new lease in 2021. The rest of it is going to be in 2022. So there is an inherent lagging concept with
respect to what's going on with market rents, which Angela just talked about, versus how it shows up on
the income statement. So I think that's important. In terms of just looking at market rents, we've tried to
provide a little bit of color on that. And with respect to S-17 is what we're trying to get at, that overall our
economic rent growth on S-17 is at minus 0.9%. And that's 1/12 of every month throughout the year. So
January 2021 versus January 2020, plus February, through the year, divided by 12 is what that number
represents. So we started the year at a -- in the minus 9% to minus 10% range. That implies, to get to
0.9% -- minus 0.9%, on S-17, that the fourth quarter will be plus 6%. And that does not anticipate a lot
of rent growth between now and then, which is pretty typical. We typically hit the peak of market rents

10

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

in July, at the end of the peak leasing season, and then it flattens out for the rest of the year. So that's
what's assumed in those numbers.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

It seems possible that your markets could experience an extended leasing season. It's certainly come up
on other calls. And some seem pretty optimistic about the prospects, but clearly as you identified, there
are some risks to take into consideration, so just wondering kind of how you went about your back half
guidance. And did you assume typical seasonality or sort of that another leg up in demand in the late
summer-early fall time frame?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. This is Mike. And I agree with you. We did not. We assumed more or less the typical trend with
respect to market rents, so kind of peaking in July and not a lot of growth for the rest of the year. If -- as
we think about it, however, there are some things that are different. For example, will the tech companies
continue hiring? Normally what happens is hiring tails off at the end of the year. Companies give business
plans at the -- towards the third and fourth quarter and then they start implementing them in the first
quarter. That's what really drives the peak leasing season. So the question here is will companies continue
hiring at a higher level, given COVID, than they have in the past. I think there's a very good chance that,
that could happen. I also -- this work-from-home and return-to-office concept could have an impact on
that as well. If more people are, yes, moving back into the more urban areas from -- the people that
were displaced as California and Washington were shutting down a year ago, if those people continue to
come back later this year, that could possibly push rents higher in the second part of the year. So we've,
again, assumed based on our experience and what typically happens a normal curve with respect to rents,
but there are some things that are different here and so we could end up with [ being a ] surprise to the
positive side.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Great. That's very helpful. And then Angela, I think you mentioned that you're restarting the
redevelopment program. Could you give us kind of the scale of that or the annual run rate and then
maybe offer up some additional details on sort of the economics? That would be really helpful.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Sure thing. We -- normally, pre COVID, our run rate was about -- in terms of units about 4,000 units a
year. And what we did was scale back significantly last year. So second half of last year, we only renovated
about 600, a little over 600 units, 650 units. So the target to -- the restart for the second half of this
year is to double that, so to achieve close to 1,300 units this year. We are looking at a couple of large
developments for future -- for next year that will have greater opportunities, but in terms of just the
return on investments, we're actually looking at ranges [ pretty darn ] consistent with pre-COVID levels.
And so while -- cost has gone up, but rents have gone up as well concurrently. So we think we're in a
pretty good spot.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And what are those numbers on the economics?

They tend to range depending on the asset and the scope and the market, but I'll give you a range. That
might be a little bit better than a hard number. They tend to range, stay in the high single digits to the
high double digits, so it's a pretty wide range.

Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer with Robert W. Baird.

Amanda Morgan Sweitzer
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

[ Following up ] on some of your comments on ramping up your development spending, can you just
provide an update on areas you're targeting for those potential projects as well as underwritten yields you
think you could achieve?

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Amanda, this is Adam. Were you referring to redevelopment or development?

Amanda Morgan Sweitzer
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I had thought you mentioned ramping up development along with acquisitions earlier in the call, but I
could be mistaken.

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Okay, yes, I'm happy to take that one. So on development, yes, given where our stock is trading and
given some opportunities that we're seeing out there now where we can make sense of accretive
transactions, we are definitely looking at ramping up the development pipeline. I'd say our main areas of
focus would be primarily Northern California, Seattle. Those, I see as probably the 2 best markets in that
respect, but we're looking throughout our portfolio and throughout our footprint for deals.

Amanda Morgan Sweitzer
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

And then any change in terms of underwritten yields you think you could achieve on those projects versus
pre-COVID levels?

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

So yes, good question. So what we're seeing, we've underwritten several dozen deals over the last few
months. The deals that we see going down primarily, cap rates have definitely compressed. So on the
development side, we're seeing on untrended rents return on costs at about 4 to 4.25 basically. So still
a gap between where existing deals are trading, which are in the, call it, 3.25 to 3.5. We're going to look
at numbers higher than that. We've not -- we wouldn't transact at a -- call it, a 4 development yield, but
we're going to -- we would be looking in the 4.5 to high 4s.

Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

So I'm interested in this 17 supplemental -- or S-17.1, I should say, the migration trends that you
referenced in your prepared remarks. Is that everything? Or is it predominantly kind of close-in like
Monterey, Sacramento type of net migration or in-migration? And does it net out people that are leaving
California entirely? Is this the full number, number one? And number two, what do you think about this

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

18%? Is this like a sort of a knee-jerk response to working remotely but closer to the office and that
probably this is peaking out at that -- this time and it starts to come back down? What's the feeling on this
graph, do you think?

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

Rich, this is Barb. Yes, on S-17.1, the 18% is a net number. So if you look back a year ago, we did have
out-migration, and that's what's showing in the negative 8%. And now we have people moving back. And
they're really coming from Sacramento and some of the outer-lying areas within California, but we're also
noticing people moving in from college towns, some people -- recent college grads are coming here for
jobs and it's really geographically dispersed. I mean it -- there's no discernible pattern from where they're
coming from. It's kind of all over. And we do think that it does speak to the strength of our markets and
people coming back and returning after the services have reopened and the economy has reopened. Now
we're seeing the people return, and so we think it's a good sign and a good leading indicator. You should
note that this -- Seattle in our portfolio looks similar as well. We're seeing a big in-migration in Seattle as
well. So we didn't show it here, but it's Bay Area and Seattle both have a similar chart where there is a
big influx. And I think you're seeing it in the rent growth that Angela spoke to and San Fran being up 11%
in the CBD. And NorCal and some of the other suburban markets in NorCal having bigger sequential rent
growth more recently is partly due to this in-migration.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Rich, I have a -- Rich, can I [indiscernible] make a broader comment? And I would say -- the broader
comment is that the migration out of the West Coast, our view, was largely driven by businesses being
shut down and putting people in the position of not having a paycheck and effectively forcing them to
move to somewhere else. And I know that sort of it doesn't fit the narrative. The narrative is that all these
people wanted to leave California. I think the reality is completely different from that. And therefore, I go
back to my basic comment, which is do we feel comfortable with the businesses that are here and with
job growth going forward. And when you look at the components of that: Okay, the hotels are now mostly
open here on the West Coast. The restaurants are opening and -- but we were still at 50% of capacity a
month or 2 ago. So we opened completely on June 15, but that process has been relatively slow. And I
think that's why job growth has lagged the U.S. as we've come out of the pandemic. And -- but I guess
the key point here is most of the migration that occurred was not voluntary migration. It was caused
by shutting down businesses. And then if you look at the flip side of that, are those businesses likely to
reopen given COVID is mostly behind us? And we feel 100%, absolutely convinced that, that will occur.

And so when we look -- we have some more broader information on migration in general. And a lot of
the same things that we talked about a year or 2 ago are still in place. The inflows into our markets tend
to be the high-cost East Coast metros, and the outflows tend to be into lower-cost Western areas. So
those trends really haven't changed all that much, but Barb, this -- S-17.1 is trying to address specifically
the cadence of what's coming in and what's going out. And to your point, yes, of course, everything is in
there. We're not here to try to push a narrative that is not reality because, if we do that, we're just going
to shoot ourselves in the foot. So there's no evidence, I think, of Essex trying to be overly optimistic. And
so we're trying to communicate what's really happening out there and what we're really seeing. So I guess
that would [indiscernible] -- yes.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Yes. I wasn't implying that. I just -- you mentioned sort of [ near and ] areas with in-migrations. I just
want to make sure I was looking at the same thing. So the second question: 15, 20 years ago, Mike Schall
and Keith Guericke were the heroes with 10%-plus growth, and California was the place to be. Now if
you had at that point made some investments in the Sunbelt, you'd be a hero. So the torch is passed, at
least for now, but I assume your reversion of the mean is your mindset certainly sounds like what you're
saying. And do you see now as a particularly interesting time to be investing in your markets for all the
reasons you just described but also particularly special because of what's happened outside of California

and Washington and what you think might come back and that there will be sort of a narrowing of the
performance gap over the next several years?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes, no -- hey. It's a great question, Rich. And our Board is pretty focused on this geographic diversity
issue and some of the challenges that we've had more recently with respect to regulation and other
things, but we don't want to get too far away from sort of this longer-term pattern because we -- it isn't
like we're going to grow every year the same. Conditions change, but we remain focused, in our analysis,
on which areas have the highest CAGRs of rent growth over time. And it may surprise you because you
can say the West Coast has dropped off of that. More recently, yes, but if you look back, let's say, 15
years because I have these numbers right out of our strategic plan in front of us, Seattle led all the major
markets by -- with a 5.6% 15-year rent growth CAGR from 2004 to 2019. So to the pre-COVID level. And
Northern California was pretty close to that. And we start going down the list. And certainly Boston and
Miami are pretty attractive in that respect, as is Northern New Jersey, but then there are a lot of markets
that really have fallen well below that. And so our whole thesis here has been let's try to identify the
things that promote long-term rent growth and let's invest in those markets. And we can -- as you know,
we've looked at some things on the East Coast before, and we'll continue doing that, but I guess, as we
think about things, let's -- let me just make a simple comparison. Let's compare San Jose with Austin. And
there are cities of about the same size, same population.

Austin has about 28,000 multifamily units in construction, whereas San Jose has about 8,000. We also
don't produce very much housing or for-sale housing in San Jose, and the median price is well over
$1 million. So as an apartment owner, we look at that and say, are we better off being in San Jose or
in Austin? And we conclude that it's better to be in San Jose. I mean Austin has to get extraordinary
amounts of growth over and above San Jose, which of course is driven by the tech companies which are
doing really well. And they hire a lot of people, so I guess I would say the bloom is not off the West Coast.
Yes, we grew really fast from 2011 through 2016, when by the way, we had job growth in the 4% to 5%
range on the West Coast. And then it slowed down because of affordability issues, because you can't have
rents grow twice as fast as incomes over long periods of time without creating affordability issues. So
there is a long-term approach to the business, and I think that making vast portfolio decisions based on --
with all the unique circumstances in COVID would be misguided.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Just first, Mike, Angela, it seems like in a lot of your prepared comments the risks of COVID or the Delta
variant [ throwing rents into the recovery ] seem like -- maybe I'm understanding wrong, like lower or
something that you're really not maybe weighting a lot. And I guess my question on that part is are --
have you thought about the Delta variant, how it's spreading a lot quicker? I think I've just seen some
studies that say like vaccinated people can also spread it as well, like, as easily as unvaccinated. And
the markets that you're in are most likely to re-shut down and reimplement restrictions if cases rise,
hospitalizations rise, et cetera, so given that that's likely to happen as the fall comes, what kind of
weighting do you kind of give to that notion of a potential hiccup from reimposed restrictions?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's a good question and an important question. And I guess I would say, unfortunately, we have
no way to really figure out what COVID might do going forward and -- but we're definitely aware of the
risks. And one thing that I think is a little bit different in California, clearly we've got population densities
that are pretty high, and so the risk of COVID is perhaps greater given that. And I think the government
actually has done a very good job here of trying to promote vaccination rates in the Essex markets. And
I think our vaccination rates are pretty high relative to the rest of the world. So the information I have

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

is that the people with at least one shot and are 12 years and older were in California and Washington
about 82% vaccinated versus 67% for the U.S. So I think that what's happened here is we've tried to --
the government has tried to react to that risk by really pushing the vaccination rate, and they've done a
very good job of that. So I think that lowers our exposure, to some extent, but no doubt areas with high
population density have a different COVID risk than some of the other areas. And in this case, I think it's
been dealt with effectively.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's a really helpful stat. Other one for me is in your previous comment you talked about not
making, I guess, rash decisions or thinking about things on a historic level. And I guess, if you look [ at
a few ] large peers -- people don't like to say names, but coastal players have recently announced pretty
significant capital plans in Raleigh, Charlotte, Atlanta, Dallas, Austin. And I would imagine they have
Boards and a lot of stakeholders that they probably consult it with before they allocate a lot of capital, so
kind of with that being said, does that -- I mean, do you give credence to that at all? I mean, does that
-- does it make you think maybe a little bit more about that? I mean you referenced that permitting is
down in your markets, and maybe that isn't like a good thing. Maybe that's like a bad thing of people are
focusing their growth prospects and capital elsewhere.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I -- it's a good question and very valid. And this is why we spend so much time in our prepared
remarks talking about what's going on with the top 10 tech companies. We created that index so that
we could keep our eye on where are the open positions for the top 10 tech companies. Are they moving
more to some of these other locations? And if so, what do we do about it? So yes, I didn't mean to imply
actually that we're so focused on 15-year CAGRs of rent growth. So definitely the historical information is
important, but we're trying to supplement that in a hundred different ways with a ton of data sources that
are either confirming or raising questions about what the future looks like. That's why Angela is talking
about how much office construction. If you're going to build office buildings, presumably there are going
to be employees in there and we're going to need to build apartments to house those employees. I mean
these are all indicators of what's happening in the future. Keeping our eye on the top 10 tech companies
and their hiring trends, again both within California and outside of California, super important in that
regard.

Again I go back to the industries. What are the driving industries? What are the industries that sort of
drive the entire machine? We can -- it's certainly not the hospitality and the restaurant workers that
are driving it. They are really the result of affluent, wealthy areas [ demanding those ] services. And
guess what. They pay a lot more than in other places of the country because of that. And so I think
what's happening here is we're in the process of -- all those people that were displaced from shutting
down restaurants and other services, we're going to need to draw them back into the area, but I think
that, given the demand for those services and given the wealth that has been created here by the tech
community, by motion pictures in Southern California and other people that want to live near a beach,
let's say, those services are in demand. And they're going to come back. It's -- it will take a little bit of
time perhaps to do that, but again, we're trying to say, okay, let's stay focused on what are the drivers of
the economy here. And again as I look at it, and hopefully, everyone will agree, tech is not going away or
hasn't gone away. Certainly all the information that we've given out with respect to the tech companies
over time confirms the thesis that they're here. They're not going away. They continue to invest in our
markets. Motion pictures in Southern California: You can't shoot, film where you require 50 to 100 people
on a set during COVID. Completely shut down. Demand for content, not going away anytime soon.
Therefore, there's a very good chance that, that is going to resume. And I can go on beyond that, but I
think that, that sets the point.

If the drivers are intact, the things that follow, the demand for services, restaurants, et cetera will follow.
And the thesis of the company in terms of job growth remains intact. And then if you don't produce
enough housing supply, I would view that as a good thing.

Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So Mike, 2 questions. First, the data on S-17, that is super. So if -- like if we were out in the Bay Area like
a month ago and saw San Francisco sort of empty, are you saying that -- with this 18% increase that now
like San Francisco will be active? And all of the apartment REITs that have reported this quarter who have
all shown that -- San Francisco to be the weak link, that will -- you're saying that we will see that change
substantially over the next few quarters.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

So you're referring to the -- this movement back to the inner Bay Area portfolio on 17.1.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes, yes.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Well, we're saying that the trend has reversed and the movement back to the Bay Area has begun. I
would -- yes, I'd caveat that. I think most of that is the service businesses, restaurants. And leisure and
hospitality is the leader in terms of jobs coming back. It -- that was the area that was most severely
disconnected during the pandemic, but -- and then we have coming at us in the not-too-distant future
the tech companies and the return-to-office programs. So I think that, that continues that trend. And
again there are a lot of restaurants that converted to a takeout-only mode. I think we'll go back to a more
normal type of situation where those restaurant workers continue to come back as well. So yes. I think it's
[ meant being ] not as fast as we want to. Again I go back to the initial premise, which is we've gotten all
the rent back -- all the rents back to where they were pre COVID with half the employment. I think that's
a pretty powerful statement.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay, but I'm just trying -- I guess my -- if you look at like Manhattan. I know you guys are not in New
York City, but the city came back a lot quicker than many expected even though work from home --
only, whatever, 20% of the buildings have people in them, but city rents and the occupancy rates have
rebounded strongly, whereas San Francisco and Seattle downtowns, respectively, were still lagging. So I
guess I'm curious if your view is that within a few quarters we will see the downtowns of San Francisco
and downtowns of Seattle rebound strongly like we've seen in New York, based on what you guys are
showing in this attachment S-17.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes, no, it's a good question, Alex. So New York: If you look at trailing 3-month job growth in New
York, it was 10.2%. San Francisco was 5.2% and San Jose was 5.2%, so you have a pretty dramatic
underperformance with respect to overall job growth. So -- and I'd attribute that to the -- again the West
Coast needing to open up. We were still, well into June, at like 50% of capacity in restaurants and that
type of thing, whereas I'm assuming that New York -- I don't know exactly what they did, but they did
something that caused a fairly dramatic difference in terms of their resurgence [ and ] employment that
hasn't happened yet on the West Coast. I think it's coming, but we're just a little bit slower than some of
the other metros, including New York.

Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then the second question is, Barb, on the guidance you said that, because of the mismatch in
terms of accelerated debt and preferred equity redemptions versus what you guys can put out, there is
about a $0.10 drag. So is that $0.10 only in NAREIT FFO but not in company FFO, or is it in both?

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

It's in both. This is because, the prepayment penalties or fees that we receive this year, about $7.5
million, those are only in total FFO and not in core FFO, but what I'm referring to is just a timing issue.
We've been redeemed, gotten money back early, so we don't have any of the interest income from those
investments. And we haven't put any money back to work. And so that's the $0.10 that I'm referring to.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

[indiscernible] we're looking at -- since that prepayment penalty has really compensated us for having our
money outstanding for a certain period of time, I'm advocating with Barb to change that so that it's not a
noncore item because we -- it's really we have a minimum earned preferred return, and unfortunately it's
showing up in the noncore category rather than core.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes. That -- Mike, that was going to be my point, is you guys are very productive on this. And whether you
get paid out over time or you get redeemed early but they pay up and pay you a penalty for that, that is
core part of your business. So that was my question, is why you would exclude the positives that come
from this platform. And I mean it sounds like you guys are having an internal debate, but I mean you're
successful at it and no point in not really showcasing the earnings potential there.

Barbara M. Pak
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's we're -- we have looked at it. We obviously have to follow GAAP accounting rules. And so it's
more complicated than it appears on the surface, but yes, there is an internal -- debate internally. But
what we've booked year-to-date has all been noncore for the prepayment fee.

Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Regarding Northern California and the recovery. I think Angela mentioned in the prepared remarks that
July effective rents are still 8% below pre-COVID levels. And I'm not sure if that was a market rent
concept or for Essex, but I was wondering if you're going against easier comps, given you were more
aggressive on concessions beginning of third quarter last year, and if the recovery could be faster than we
think.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I'll let Angela comment on the number for San Jose, but I would say what's happened here is --
and we had callers on previous calls that have said, "Hey. With negative job growth, how are you able to
maintain high levels of occupancy in the cities?" And obviously a great question. And the answer to that
was, of course, that we drew people because the price point was lower. We drew people from other places
into some of the better locations. So they improved their location given lower rents. And so now you look
at this equation that we're 96% occupied. People are starting to come back and there's no availability,
and therefore market rents are doing what they're doing. So I think a lot of this is really driven by our

17

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

strategy during the pandemic. And now it'll be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of
years because market -- with market rents now back to where they were pre-pandemic levels, what is the
movement within the portfolio both in and out of those locations that have much higher rents? So in the
case of San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland, they're still substantially below the prior rents, so there's
still reason to believe that those -- the people that moved in given lower rents will stay, but that may
uncouple over the next several years.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And so was -- that 8% figure that Angela quoted, was that for Essex or for the market overall?

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

That was for Essex.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. Mike, you mentioned cap rates in your markets are low to mid-3%, which sounds like it's
compressed about 50 basis points at least from last quarter. Can you comment on the assumptions that
you think the market is placing now that's changed, whether it's rental growth or exit cap rate; and
whether or not you agree with those assumptions or believe they're rational?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start with the comment and the comparison to last quarter and then flip it to Adam to talk about
cap rates more generally, but I think, last quarter, what we said was in some of the hard-hit areas -- that
buyers were pro forma-ing some rent recovery. So it probably wasn't a whole 50 basis point reduction. It
was really that they weren't using really the current net effective rents. They were assuming a bit higher
rent level. So that reconciles part of that, but Adam, do you want to talk about cap rates in general?

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Yes, sure. So I think the general assumption that buyers are making is that there will be a full recovery.
And by that, I mean with rents greater than pre-pandemic levels. And we're already seeing those rents
that we've already talked about during the call. So yes. It's in the low 3s. I think pretty robust rent growth
over the next few years and then probably mellowing out is what I -- is -- the various people that I have
talked to, that's what they're modeling. And then on exit caps, I think it's as aggressive as ever. So I don't
think there is much assumption that there is a big expansion on the exit side. So it -- underwriting has
definitely gotten more aggressive.

John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Is there a big difference between your markets or urban versus suburban?

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. Good question. So going kind of North to South: Seattle, we've seen, we've actually seen a pretty
big pickup in transactional volume. And that's probably amongst the most aggressive markets that we're
seeing. In the CBDs, on kind of current net effective rents, we're seeing high 2s to low 3s. And in the
markets that really didn't do too much of a hit on rents, we're seeing those like maybe in the 3.25 to 3.5
range on the much more suburban outer markets. And then going down, very little in Northern California
is traded, so it's hard to really opine there, but it's in that probably low 3s range. And then down to like
San Diego, Orange County and -- those markets performed better from a rental aspect. So those cap
rates on current net effective aren't quite as low as what we've seen in those harder-hit markets. So it's

18

probably closer to that 3.4, 3.5 kind of range. And very little in L.A. is traded as well. So it's down in the
kind of low 3s, but there's very few data points.

Yes. It's Angela here. So out of -- I think we reported that we have about $55 million of delinquencies
out there, and we've applied for about $18 million. And to date, we've received $4 million, so that's still
about a 20-some-percent recovery rate. As far as we could tell, it's really more of a slow going because
California just has a more complicated and slower reimbursement process. So in our view, that $18
million, we don't view that $18 million as having significant risk from that perspective. The reason we
didn't bake it into our guidance for this year is really the timing is the question and just given that the
rate of reimbursement has just been much slower. And so that's really the key driver of why it's not in this
year's guidance.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay, got it. And that $4 million, I assume that's largely been this month just given you said there wasn't
-- it was sort of negligible in the first half. Or is that right?

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Yes, yes, for the most part, this month.

Bradley Barrett Heffern
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay, got it. And then just one administrative sort of one, if I could: In the press release there was a
6.3% blended rate number for July, but then in the commentary I heard a 4.7% number. I just wanted to
verify what those 2 things we're talking about.

Angela L. Kleiman
Senior EVP & COO

Sure. So the 4.7% is a sequential month-to-month. So what I was trying to do is provide a real-time
picture of what's happening in our markets. So comparing July to June of this month, it's already up
sequentially 4.7% on a net effective basis. And so what's in our supplement, that blended lease rate is a
year-over-year. So that compares July of this year to July of last year.

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates.

Alexander Kalmus
Zelman & Associates LLC

Looking at your Southern California occupancy. It's quite high. And we've heard a lot this quarter from
others that the delinquencies are -- in their portfolios are sort of concentrated in this part of the country,

so I'm just curious. What would happen if -- once the moratoriums are up? Does that affect the occupancy
levels on a physical basis, in your mind? Or how do you see that playing out there?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. This is Mike. It's a good question. Yes, we agree with the others that Southern California and really
specifically Los Angeles is a big part of the delinquency, the largest part of the delinquency. And therefore,
there's some question about what might happen, but it's not a huge percentage. And we expect to work
with our residents to the extent we can and so I don't think it will have a huge impact on occupancy
overall. So -- but it remains to be seen because we can't envision exactly what that scenario is going to
look like. And so we -- but it's just not enough, I think, to really severely impact us.

Alexander Kalmus
Zelman & Associates LLC

Got it. And just thinking about the regulations on rent increases that are in place and when you're sort of
internally discussing the difference between holding occupancy or pushing rate, is there any momentum to
say you'd rather keep the base rates pretty high to then expand a little more there and maybe lose a little
occupancy as a sacrifice? Or is it -- it is still hold occupancy as a primary driver.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's different by -- in each region. And so there's a thousand different pieces to that equations
because there's been so much movement in rent. And so we're going to -- so the answer is going to vary
by region and so it's difficult to generalize throughout the portfolio, but we think that we will be able to
work with residents. We've tried to do that in the past. That will continue going on in the future. And
certainly with respect to any of the delinquency that's not covered by some of these programs, to make
good on the COVID-related delinquencies, we'll try to work with our residents we -- as we have in the
past. Again it's a little bit difficult to try to figure out exactly what that means from different areas because
there are sets of regulations in a variety of different places, from emergency orders to state rent control
and the like. And so it's sort of a case-by-case basis. It's difficult to generalize.

Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Adam, I appreciate all the cap rate commentary. I'm trying to square those really low cap rates to the
commentary about ramping or being more positive on external growth because, from the cap rates
quoted, it feels like you guys are trading at an NAV discount. So can you maybe just help square the
external growth appetite and the prevailing private market pricing?

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Sure, yes. I mean you hit the nail on the head. It's the reason why we haven't been super active on the
external growth side is that these are -- that most of the transactions that have gone down have not been
accretive; and to your point and from an NAV standpoint, not accretive as well. We're seeing a few more
opportunities out there that will fit. And our stock is recently up, although still I'd say, when you're looking
at low 3s, that still -- that puts us in the trading below NAV range. So we're underwriting everything, being
more aggressive where we feel like we can make some -- make a difference on growth accretion as well as
FFO, but yes, you nailed it. It's that's why we haven't done much, so far.

John, I would add that -- this is Mike, obviously. I would add that we're closer now than we were 30 or
45 days ago. So we're getting close. I mean debt rates have come down quite substantially, as you know.
And so there at least is a hope that we will be more -- we're looking at a lot of deals. Adam is looking at
a lot of deals. And so we're [ pricing ] things out and trying to make the numbers work. And again we're
going to remain disciplined [ to -- and review ] the company versus what we're seeing out there in the
transaction area. We think that's the fundamental behind the success of the company over long periods of
time.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Okay. No, understood. Things are moving quickly. Maybe just Adam or Mike, based off prevailing private
market prices today, if you had to double down on a market and you had to exit a market, what are kind
of the top and bottom picks?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

I'll let Adam deal with that one.

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

Good question, yes. Thanks, John. So double down. I'm a big fan of Seattle in general, and I would say
East side especially given the jobs picture there. Even though supply is slightly elevated, I think the jobs
picture there is significant. And it's lots of tailwinds. To exit a market? [ We love all of our ] markets, but
maybe Hemet...

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

We're definitely interested in exiting Hemet, yes. That's one property...

Adam W. Berry
Executive VP & Chief Investment Officer

No. It -- yes. I joke. Ventura has had a pretty good run here as of late. And it continues to do fine, but
again if we had to pick a market -- like I said, we are focused on our entire footprint. And so we'll go in
where we see opportunities.

Operator

There are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing
remarks.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Okay, very good. Thank you, Doug. Appreciate that. And I want to thank everyone for joining us on the
call today. Appreciate your time. And we know we've covered a lot of ground. If there are any follow-up
questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us. And we thought it was a great dialogue. And we look forward
to seeing many of you, hopefully, at a conference and in person in the near future.

Thanks for joining the call.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You
may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.
