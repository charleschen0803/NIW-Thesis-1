Good early morning from San Francisco
Thank you for taking the time to join us
As always, we welcome this opportunity to speak directly to you, our shareholders
You show us your faith in Twitter as an open platform for what's happening in the world and you drive us to do our best work
Profound thanks and gratitude to the people who use Twitter goes without saying, but I say it anyway
They inspire us every day
Aside from a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in daily actives, growth in video and accelerating year-over-year growth in our data revenue, I want to briefly underscore five highlights from this quarter in the areas of focus, growth, product, safety and leadership
You may recognize some of these statements from my first earnings call back in 2015. I emphasize the connection only to illustrate how steadfast our team has been
In 2015, we mentioned a need to better communicate our value
Twitter is what's happening in the world and what people are talking about
Twitter's value is in focus now more than ever with all functions aligned and marching to the same beat
In 2015, we said simplify our service to deliver Twitter's value faster
We have developed what we believe are simple, steady, and sustainable engines of growth, which brings me to my third point
In 2015, we asserted a need to ensure a more disciplined execution
Our discipline in this regard is now robust
We're shipping products faster than ever and this empowers us to build features that can enable strong future growth
People are reporting significantly less abuse on Twitter today than they were six months ago
We take action on 10 times the abusive accounts daily compared to this time last year
Blocks after @mentions from people you don't follow are down 40%
Strong progress here but as always, there's more work to be done
This quarter we brought in exceptional leadership
We introduced Bruce Falck, who heads our Revenue Products, we're proud to have Candi Castleberry-Singleton as our Head of Inclusion and Diversity; and Ned Segal will start as our new CFO, and we look forward to having him on our next call
Finally, often described as Twitter's soul, it makes me happy to have my co-founder Biz Stone, back at Twitter full time, already making a big impact
With that, I'd like to open up the call to questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Thank you for the question, Michael
So we've been focusing a lot of our energy on making sure that we have some of the best leadership in the world, and we made a lot of progress over this past three months in bringing in a few folks
Really excited about Bruce, who joins us to lead our Revenue Product
He has been spending the past six weeks sitting down with the team, validating all of our plans and our strategy, and continuing to simplify and differentiate the product and really focus the team on ROI
And we're getting some – making some good progress there
Candi joined us as our VP of Inclusion and Diversity, and Ned is joining us on our next earnings call as our CFO and we're really excited about his principled, engaging and rigorous approach to the CFO role
I spend the majority of my time on recruiting and we're looking for more engineering and product leadership throughout the company
One of the things that brings people to Twitter is our purpose, and being a place – the first place in the world to see what's going on and what's happening and what people are talking about
It's a strong purpose that people want to join and they also want to help with a company and a service that they feel is really critical and important for the world
So first and foremost, we look for purpose
We look for passion
And we look for great people who can help us focus and continue to help our discipline and help our execution and continue to drive the results that we've been seeing in the consumer product
Thank you, Lloyd
As it relates to the video strategy and our differentiation, we think we have significant differentiation in the live video premium category given the uniqueness of Twitter
Twitter is what's happening, and our audience is coming, leaning forward, looking to see what's happening
It's an influential audience, it's an audience in discovery mode and it's an audience that's connected to each other
The biggest point I want to emphasize is the one I made upfront which is we're building live off of a position of strength
That position of strength is that people have been on the platform for more than a decade talking about these events already
All we're simply doing is taking all those tweets and bringing them together through our machine learning and putting it into a great timeline that gives them the best of that conversation with the companion video that goes along with it which should more conversation, faster distribution, and more discussion
The greatest testament we have for our ability to compete in the marketplace while we may be smaller than others is we're renewing our deals
We've renewed the vast majority of our deals that we've anniversaried and the signs on the deals that we've already done and that need to be renewed are very positive
Getting to 1,200 hours of live streaming content up from 600 hours in our first quarter of Q4 is also a testament to the value proposition we can deliver
We've gone head to head with a number of our competitors with the same exact content streaming at the same exact time, and we've been able to beat our competitors whether it's in sports, whether it's in news and politics, whether it's in eSports because we have a different audience that's highly engaged with this content already and has an interest in it
And so that has helped us deliver
Our advertising product is also very differentiated
We have mid-stream video ads as well as pre-roll ads
We're not just licensing live content
We're licensing the live content for all of the Twitter windows, in-progress, highlight windows, post events windows, and then on-demand windows and that's also differentiated
It allows us to put more of the content into the home timeline which is where people spend the majority of their time and create somewhat of a productivity loop across that live video that is the starting point for the windows that come after it, all contributing to the value for our advertising partners and of course our content owners that are trying to reach a younger, global audience that's hard to reach
One of the points I'll give you anecdotally is that we've been able to deliver an audience for our content partners that's younger than their other forms of distribution and that has been incremental, but we recently did a study that actually showed not only do we drive incremental reach for our content partners, we're also doing it for our advertising partners
We did a study – couple of studies with Nielsen on total ad ratings and based on those studies we've been able to provide an average of a 6% incremental reach to television campaigns against targeted demographics
The incremental reach that skews toward the 18-year to 24-year olds is actually 25% relative to what they get on TV and that's an audience that hard to reach in that medium and so we're adding incremental value and reach for advertisers as well with a format that they're familiar with and comfortable with, which is their video content in advertising
As it relates to your second question, our over-the-top strategy is much broader than Roku
We have a video app that's on Apple TV
We also are on Amazon Fire in addition to Microsoft Xbox and Roku is a new addition to that distribution
As we move to 24/7 programming in sports and news, we think those larger screens will be more accessible and more valuable to individuals as opposed to episodic content throughout the week, so we'll always be on
We want to be a dependable place for people to see what's happening in live and these over-the-top platforms will give a better viewing experience for that type of content
And, Ross, we've been working over the past few months on some really foundational work, and Twitter Lite represents one of these
One of our goals is to make sure Twitter is accessible to anyone in the world
And Twitter Lite exactly hits on this particular goal
Especially in places like India, we found that our app was just way too slow to access
So we have areas in the world where network infrastructure is more costly, and we could be a lot better in terms of serving those markets and those countries
So it's way too soon to assess the usage trends, but our initial results look really positive
But it speaks more broadly to a foundational approach we're taking to make sure that Twitter gets more and more accessible to people all over the world, independent of their device type or the network that they're on
The other foundational move that we launched over the past few months is a redesign
And this redesign went across all of our services; the app on iOS, on Android and on the web
And typically, this would take the team months to complete, and we were able to do this in weeks
And we're really proud of that because it speaks to our ability now to execute across the entire service much, much faster
The redesign was also really important because it clarifies a bunch of areas that new people were having trouble with or confused by, and it gives a lot of room for our team to move much faster and to build more cohesive end-to-end experiences
So we've laid some really good foundation down that allows more people to access Twitter, and we're really excited to see what people do with it
We have made a commitment to improve our stock-based compensation as a percent of revenue from where it was at over 40% a couple years ago down to the level of our competitive peers in the high single digits as a percent of revenue to low double digits
We have made great progress in that regard
This is our second quarter of reporting results and we have improved our outlook for stock-based compensation decline on a year-over-year basis once again in our guidance
We still feel comfortable that we'll be able to achieve the objective over the next couple years in SPC as a percent of revenue and the progress we've made so far is quite significant
If you dig into the numbers you'll see a sizable absolute increase as well as a relative increase as a percent of revenue
It is a commitment that we have to get there and we're doing it in three ways
One, we're anniversarying some initial grants from people prior to the IPO in 2014. Two, we're replacing some stock-based compensation with cash bonuses at year-end, and then three, obviously growing revenue will be a key driver of getting it down as a percent of revenue
So it's a focus
And last point I'd make is we're committing to keep our net dilution in the low-single digits, and we've been able to do that since 2014.
Yes
Thanks, Ron
So we've been investing pretty heavily in machine learning and deep learning throughout the product
We've been focusing most of our energy on the timeline and notifications, and the more relevant we make the timeline, the more we show relevant tweets to people, the more engaged they are
And that's both in likes and retweets and also replies and tweeting itself
So we've progressed in a pretty significant way along the timeline, along notifications
Explore represents a new approach for us where we're organizing not around accounts but around topics, and topics that people are interested in as well
So within Explore, you find Moments, you find Search, you find Trends and you also find some of our live content as well
And more and more, you'll see more experiments around organizing Twitter in a topic-forward and interest-forward way, which allows us to experiment in terms of really getting to what people I think come to Twitter for, which is to follow their interests to follow their passions and to follow the debate and the conversation
So it's a good way after you exhaust your timeline to find new things around what's happening in the world, whether it's topic based or location based or if it's a particular live event
So machine learning and deep learning is fueling both the timeline, notifications and everything that we do in the Explore tab and it just gets better and better every single day
The team has a really clear roadmap ahead for each
Thank you again for your questions and for your continued faith in Twitter
I'm very proud of the team for our achievements and focused growth execution, safety and products and our leadership additions
I'm confident we are on the trajectory to success in products, revenue and in building Twitter into a company of enduring value
Have a wonderful day or night depending on where you are and see you on Twitter
