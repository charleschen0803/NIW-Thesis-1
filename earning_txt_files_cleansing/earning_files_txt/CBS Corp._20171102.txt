Thank you, Adam, and good afternoon, everyone
I'm pleased to tell you that CBS has delivered solid third quarter results
Revenue was up 3% to $3.2 billion and EPS was up 6% to $1.11, marking our 31st consecutive quarter of EPS growth
So we're on our way to completing another strong year with an even better 2018 on the way
As always, the heart of our continued success is our content
The only thing that's changing is the way in which viewers want to consume it
The good news for CBS and its shareholders is that we've been anticipating these changes for a long, long time
And because we see change as opportunity, we've moved early to set up even better success both now and in the years ahead, because as the industry has changed, we've often been there first
We were the first broadcaster to get fair compensation for our content through retrans and reverse comp from our affiliates
We were the first network to launch its own SVOD service
Most recently, we've been a pioneer in skinny bundles as well
No matter how people want to watch us, we've made sure to be there
The implications of this are clear and they make us different than virtually any other company in the media space
Where others worry about cord cutters, we don't
We are ready for them
We welcome that
In fact, where others are losing subs to cord cutters, we are growing
This is significant
When you put together our traditional bundles, skinny bundles, and our over-the-top services, we have more subs today at both CBS and at Showtime than we did a year ago
That's right, our subs are growing, unlike those of most other media companies
Best of all, as consumers cut the cord and switch to skinny bundles or go over-the-top, the economics get better for us
So not only are we growing subs, but we're also growing our rates as well
Let me explain
At CBS, when a consumer switches from a traditional to a skinny bundle, we get double the fees
If they move to CBS All Access, that revenue sometimes tripled from what we get from traditional distributors
At the same time, our base is growing in retrans with each new deal that we do, and that's not to mention the advertising, which is sold at a higher rate on these platforms
This dynamic is also benefiting Showtime, where we are now at 25 million subs across traditional and digital platforms
Here once again, over-the-top is a more profitable business model, with a sub rate that is more than substantially higher than what we get from Showtime's MVPD distributors
So let me say this again, because it is very important
Not only are we not affected as others are by cord cutting, it has real measurable upside for us
This is what sets CBS apart from the pack
As the industry moves ahead to more viewer choice and newer subscription models, there will continue to be a widening gap between the haves and have-nots, and clearly we're on the right side of that divide
Plus, at the same time that we're seeing growth in rates and subs, we're also very pleased with the consistency of our advertising revenue, which is strong and steady year after year
Consider this
In each of the last five years, we've generated a very consistent $4 billion in network advertising, and that doesn't even include the Super Bowl, which is in addition to that total
When 2017 is complete, we expect once again to be just north of that number
So even though advertising is now a smaller part of our revenue, only 40% year to date, our total is still very steady
And as we look ahead, we're beginning to capitalize on new opportunities to grow our advertising in significant ways
These opportunities are developing because as technology advances, our analytics become more sophisticated
Taking a page from our friends in the digital space, we're now moving beyond selling solely based on a viewer's age and increasingly reaching them with strong data on what products and services they want to buy
This is significantly more valuable to our advertisers, and it gives us much more revenue per impression
And we have more impressions to sell all the time, thanks to delayed viewing
Many of our shows are seeing a lift of 3 million, 4 million, and even 5 million additional viewers in the seven days after they first air, and in many cases as much as 50% over the original viewing number
And these extra viewers are increasingly coming to us via digital platforms, where we're getting paid even more
To seize this opportunity, as we told you about during our last call, we recently took a big step forward by combining all of our network and digital sales
We brought in the top executive of domestic sales from Facebook to work with our terrific network sales team
This will fully combine the benefits of targeted high-CPM digital sales with the unparalleled reach of broadcast television
Now virtually every network sale has a digital component and vice-versa
To build on that effort, just yesterday we announced the hiring of Radha Subramanyam, who is one of our industry's leading experts in data analysis
Going forward, Radha will work alongside the incomparable David Poltrack, giving us the best research team in the business
And, we are able to attack this opportunity with the number one watched network in all of media
The CBS Television Network has the top two shows, three of the top five, and six of the top 10, including Young Sheldon, which had a premiere episode that has been the most watched show on all of television so far this season, and which comes back on the air tonight
Along with Young Sheldon, we have two of the three top new series this fall, most notably SEAL Team, which is produced by our CBS Television Studio (sic) [CBS Television Studios] (8:17), and was just picked up for a full season order
Every new owned hit we launch goes into our content value chain that we can monetize for years to come
For example, just a few weeks ago we announced a series of multi-platform syndication deals for Madam Secretary, where we were able to license the show at a higher combined rate than in the old world, where we would have sold the shows to just one buyer
In addition, we are currently in a number of active negotiations for NCIS: New Orleans, so expect an announcement imminently
These are just two of an all-time high 65 shows that our in-house studios are creating for 11 broadcast, cable, and streaming outlets
That's more than double what we produced in-house just five years ago, and it includes all kinds of content, whether it's the mass appeal hits we create for CBS primetime, or the ultra-premium series we do for Showtime or CBS All Access, or the content we create for more niche audiences at The CW and Pop, or our industry-leading first-run syndication programming
We do it all, and we do well
And owning this much content allows us to sell it in more and different ways all the time
We can choose whether to keep a show in-house or license it to an outside partner like we just did with our highly acclaimed new series, American Vandal, which we are producing for Netflix, and which we just picked up for a second season
And also like we did for Carpool Karaoke and Drop the Mic, which we developed with James Corden and recently launched on Apple TV and TBS respectively
Corden, by the way, continues to be a big hit for us across all digital and linear platforms
And of course, Stephen Colbert continues his terrific run as well
Outside of the 2009-2010 season when Conan O'Brien replaced Jay Leno mid-season, we are number one in late night for the first time in 20 years, and we're winning by a large margin
Colbert is also the only late-night talk show that's up in all key demos, including a 25% increase in viewers from last year
Turning to sports, while NFL ratings have been up and down this season, it is still the best game in town
There's no better way for advertisers to reach a mass audience, and it still provides the best promotional platform to us to launch our new shows
It's also been great to see Tony Romo become a true sensation for us in the broadcast booth working alongside the great Jim Nantz
Over at CBS News, we had another very welcome addition to our talent ranks this fall when Oprah Winfrey joined 60 Minutes
Thanks to Oprah and the entire 60 Minutes crew, this show has continued its dominance in its 50th season
In three of the last five weeks, 60 Minutes has been a top-10 show, including one week where it reached number two
Last week we named Jeff Glor as the next anchor of the CBS Evening News
Not only does Jeff have the experience we were looking for, but as an original anchor on our streaming news service, CBSN, he represents the next generation of anchors that will carry CBS News into the digital age
Meanwhile, nearly three years after its launch, CBSN continues to grow at a rapid clip
For the first nine months of the year, streams are up 37% over 2016, which is all the more impressive when you consider that that was a presidential year
Even as we continue to invest in it, CBSN has become profitable for us in a very short time
As we look ahead, we're just beginning to take the next step for this asset by distributing it as a standalone channel in skinny bundles and virtual MVPDs
And we look forward to replicating its success with a new OTT sports service, called CBS Sports HQ, that will launch in the coming months
But the big story for us in over-the-top is our two major services, CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, and our premium content is key to the success of both of them
At All Access, we are benefiting from the one-two punch of a full season of the NFL and the launch of Star Trek: Discovery, and the results have been phenomenal
Star Trek: Discovery in particular has been a game-changer
premiere episode led to new records for the most All Access signups in a single week, and in the show's second week we topped that record once again
Internationally, the show has been a huge hit in many key territories
As a result of this terrific performance, we have already renewed Star Trek: Discovery for what we know will be a great second season
In addition, this month on All Access, we'll be launching a new comedy from and featuring Will Ferrell called No Activity
It will premiere right after the season finale of Star Trek: Discovery and also be produced by CBS Studios
Then next year, we'll have the return of The Good Fight along with a new drama from Ridley Scott called Strange Angel, and more on the way
And now another important announcement, today we're pleased to tell you that All Access will be the home of a new version of one of the most iconic television shows of all time, The Twilight Zone
We're sure that we will dramatically boost subscribers once again, and that's not all
With Star Trek and now Twilight Zone, we've just begun to tap the intellectual property we have at our disposal for future series
And once again, all of these new shows for All Access are being produced by our own television studio
So, All Access has grown into a remarkably powerful platform for us, and we're now gearing up to scale the service in a whole new way overseas
We have seen the success the other streaming services have had globally, and we think this is fertile ground for All Access too
So we will begin to expand into the international marketplace, starting with Canada next year, followed by Australia
Australia is a natural extension for All Access thanks to our pending acquisition of Network Ten
In addition to owning one of the big three broadcasters in Australia, this acquisition will also give us control over our content across all forms of distribution in that market
So we will combine the reach of a major television network with an emerging streaming service playing right into our expertise
Sound familiar? The combination of traditional and new is also key to our success at Showtime, which continues to have some of the best original series on television
As we mentioned at the top, sub and rate growth at Showtime has been a great story for us, and it's all driven by our premium content
Following the success of Twin Peaks in the second quarter, we brought back Ray Donovan in the third, when of course we also had the Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor fight
Thanks to this event, by the way, we've now had the three highest grossing pay-per-view events in history with Mayweather's fights against McGregor, Manny Pacquiao, and Canelo Alvarez
Up ahead, we'll have a new season of our murderer's row of hit series, including this weekend's return of Shameless, Showtime's number one comedy, followed by two of our biggest hits, Homeland and Billions, in January
Along with Showtime, publishing also had a terrific quarter, driven by a strong slate of titles from well-known authors across several genres
In fact, during the last full week of the quarter, we had the number one titles across eight different New York Times best-seller categories
These include: the number one in hardcover fiction, The Cuban Affair, by Nelson DeMille; the number one in hardcover nonfiction, What Happened, by Hillary Clinton; and the number one how-to book by Tom Brady, The TB12 Method
Turning to local media, our TV stations also performed well for us during the quarter, with total non-political revenue up mid-single digits
Our stations continue to benefit from the strength of our primetime schedule and live event programming, including the Emmys, which set a sales record for us during the quarter
Local media becomes obviously really important when covering crucial breaking news in all of our communities
In that regard, I'm particularly proud of the programming and information we provided during the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, where we own stations, and the $10 million our entire station group raised for hurricane relief
So yes, we are in a time of great change across our industry
But at CBS, as you have seen, we have been anticipating these changes for years, and we have been actively innovating and investing in our businesses to stay ahead of them
And what distinguishes CBS is how time and time again, we've turned change into new growth opportunities
First, it bears repeating that you should not think of us the same way as you think of other media companies
Thanks to the combination of traditional bundles, skinny bundles, and OTT, our subs are growing at both CBS and Showtime, so cord-cutting is an opportunity here at CBS
And in advertising, advances in digital will make our number one content that much more valuable
If people want to watch our programming live or a month after it airs, we're on a path to monetizing all viewing in increasingly lucrative ways
And in terms of licensing our content, whether we sell our programming to the leading SVOD services or to linear cable and broadcast networks, we're constantly expanding the capabilities of our prolific CBS Studios, both domestically and around the globe
All of these opportunities will drive our success into the future, and we look forward to updating you along the way
And with that I'll turn it over to Joe
Thanks, Ben
Look, the NFL, obviously there's been a lot going on
The ratings are down a bit this year
There's been a lot of talk on it
Obviously, there were political issues that came up about kneeling during the anthem, and it became very controversial
Look, the product, as I said before, is still the best thing on television
The ratings are still extraordinarily high
I think all the networks are very happy they have the product
And you see when you compare it to other things, live events are still working phenomenally well
Yes, there's a lot of experimentation going on with these shorter ad spots
There's been experimentation with – this year there are four pods per half versus five, which are slightly longer
So there are all sorts of things that are being tried
In addition with the challenges that the coaches have, they are being shortened and the game is trying to be expedited
There's a lot of product there, there's no question about it
I think everybody is looking at everything
We've had Thursday Night Football for the last four years
There are a lot of real values to it in terms of being a promotional vehicle and having those five Thursday night numbers are still very, very strong for us
I think everybody is going to take another look at what's going on as we proceed forward
But once again, we're still happy we have the NFL
It's still a great product
Regarding programming, it's a very interesting question, and it came up when we started talking about Star Trek
Every division at this company wanted Star Trek
Showtime wanted it, the network wanted it
If you remember, earlier versions of Star Trek were even syndicated from station to station
We felt as we were doing are planning for All Access, we said we need something extraordinary, we need something that people really feel is worth paying for outside the norm
And we said that's the perfect place for it
It's a very expensive program, as you know
Fortunately, Netflix covers a lot of the cost by the international rights
So the kinds of programming that's on All Access will probably somewhat will be more premium, let's say, than it would be on CBS
We are spending more on the product
We don't need as mass an audience as we may do on CBS, but it needs to be more specialized
It needs to stand out quite a bit
As I said earlier, I am blessed since I'm a content guy with having Showtime and All Access and CBS and The CW
We do all sorts of all different kinds of programming, and we have different development units at each division
And in certain cases, like Star Trek, there's a jump ball, and I will generally make that decision
And for this one, we felt we were launching a very important new product, and the good news is the bet is paying off
I don't know of one sponsor that has pulled out of any spot that they had
I don't think it's affecting advertising or their desire one iota
Thanks, Ben
It's a very good question, and there is a long lag, and frankly we're not getting in all the numbers, and you often have to wait literally three or four weeks before you see the results
So anybody who's basing anything on overnight ratings is either 20 years behind or crazy
So putting the different pieces together and how we're selling it and how we're measuring it is changing so rapidly that we have to look at new systems
Obviously, Nielsen is still a very big player and an important player and they're adding more and more services, but there are other players getting into the marketplace
And measurement and our dealings with advertising agencies become much more complex than ever before
As you know, only a few years ago we began C3. Now it's C7. Now we're selling some up to C35. There are all sorts of numbers that are coming in from DVR playing, from VOD, et cetera, et cetera
So it's very complicated
I don't quite understand it
I don't get the same thrill as I used to when I put ER on the air and I saw a 40 share in the overnight ratings
Now I have to wait a month to get my thrill
So it's a very different ball game and it's rapidly changing
So it's a very valid question
Thank you, Jessica, next question, please
Let me talk about the demographic
Obviously, as I said before, in terms of the programming, we're looking to distinguish it from CBS, from regular CBS
Obviously, the demographic, what we've noticed, it's approximately 20 years younger than our average viewer
So we are getting a younger demographic, which is really good
As I said, it doesn't have to be as broad
It can be much more niche
We started out with Good Fight, which obviously brought a great deal of the female component over from CBS because it was a very female-skewing show
Star Trek is more male than female and also, as you would expect, a younger demographic as well
Star Trek will continue to expand it
We're looking
The good news about All Access, we don't care whether you're 8 or you're 80. We're bringing in people from all over the place
And different people are watching for different reasons, some to get old library product, some to get catch-up on our current series, and obviously a lot of people that are looking to see the new product
So it's very interesting, it's very exciting, and we're going to be adding new content all the time
Yeah
And let me just add on to that
The 65 comes from – we started out, number one, Showtime, CBS, obviously producing more content for ourselves
Then you add in The CW, where either Warner or we are producing or co-producing together
Then you add in All Access, which is obviously only produced shows
And then suddenly, as you heard us mention, we're selling to 11 different services
With the aftermarket being as strong as it is in terms of both domestic and international syndication, the idea of selling to all sorts of different people has become very, very lucrative, which is why virtually every time we invest in a new show, we already know it's going to be profitable from day one
So when we sell a show to Turner or we sell a show to Netflix or we sell a show to anywhere, to Apple, we already know these are going to be in profit before day one of production
And that means that we're going to continue to increase that 65 number to a lot more
Thanks, Mike
The skinny bundles, it is way too early to judge on the success or not success of what they're doing
I think the concept of skinny bundles is a smart one
It's based on the idea that people really want to pay for what they're watching and that they're paying the huge amount of money for 12 to 15 channels that they watch and they're getting 180 channels
So I think they are absolutely viable
Will they all succeed? I don't know
By the way, the technology on them, they're pretty cool devices to use
And they make it easy to watch the content and watch what you want to see
I don't think, as I said to you, the success or failure of various skinny bundles, once again, doesn't matter to us
Because when people cut their cord, they're not going nowhere
They're going somewhere
So they either go, they're on a traditional bundle or one or two of the skinny bundles or All Access
So if people are going to – we don't view people as trying to squeeze us for price, because we're going to be must-have television
Every deal that we make, we are convinced that bundles will not work without CBS on them
You've seen us make a few deals in the last few months, and I think it's proven that you can't have a complete bundle without CBS
Look, Netflix and Amazon are throwing a lot of money at a lot of product out there, and there's no question it makes the marketplace more competitive
Having said that, once again, we have been fairly diligent in that we know how to produce shows for the maximum value
Obviously, each platform has a different price point
Shows at Showtime and All Access generally cost more than shows at CBS, and shows at The CW cost somewhat less than CBS shows as well
But by the same token, we take that into account
We know what our international output deals are
We know what our domestic syndication probably is
We also once again can regulate what the back-end participation is for our producers here, and there's a real upside for them for coming here versus Netflix or Amazon, where oftentimes they will be giving their rights away
But every show that we do, we do ultimate
So if we are spending more like on a Star Trek, we know, A), what Netflix is going to pay for the international rights
We also know what it's going to mean to CBS All Access
Before we green-light a show on the CBS Television Network, we have an absolute based on, as I said, international output deals or international deals in general as well as the domestic potential
So as costs may go up somewhat: A), we're able to control them better; and B), we know we're going to be profitable on every single one of the shows
So the outlook for us is good, and that's why we will invest in more programming, and that 65 number very well could turn into 80 within a couple years
There's no question
The NFL, as we may have told you, you may remember, we only had the last two weeks last year of the NFL season
So having it this year certainly helped the subscribers
Probably helped more by Star Trek, but having those two things both go on in September-October has certainly launched a number of subscribers
As you know, we're not giving the numbers, but it definitely has helped
And every Sunday, we do see a spike in the number of signups
So I think it's really important
As we look down to the next big contract in 2022, obviously digital rights will be an important part of it
We expect that some of the larger players will be involved
But who knows, we may get all the digital rights ourselves at the same time
I'll take the last question first
TV City was formed in the 1950s
It was a production facility
It's on very valuable real estate
We're in the very preliminary stages
We have received an offer from one of the people in the neighborhood, and so we hired somebody to explore the possibility
As I said, it's very expensive real estate
It may be money that can be used better elsewhere
But it's at the very preliminary stages
I'll turn the rest to Joe
