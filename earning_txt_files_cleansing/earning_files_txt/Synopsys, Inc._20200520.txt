Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call
for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2020. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being
recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead.

Lisa Ewbank
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-
CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone
that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-
looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent
our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and
performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from what we expect.

In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future
results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release. In addition, we
will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings
press release, financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items plus the
most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared
remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.

Finally, we are all participating from different locations today. Please forgive any delays, technology
glitches or awkward handoffs in the Q&A session as we navigate this new virtual dynamic.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Good afternoon. I'm happy to report outstanding second quarter results with record orders, revenue,
non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow. We substantially exceeded all of our key guidance
metrics. Revenue was $861 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $0.71 and non-GAAP earnings
of $1.22. Orders were substantially greater than our internal plan driven primarily by digital design
software, and we continue to make good progress on our margin expansion goals. As a result of our first
half strength and the resilience of our business, we are reaffirming our revenue and non-GAAP margin
guidance for the year while raising our non-GAAP earnings and cash flow targets. Trac will discuss the
financials in more detail.

Before providing quarterly highlights, let me comment on the market landscape, which is, of course,
dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its substantial recessionary pressure on the global economy.
While in a matter of weeks, many companies around the world have adapted to widespread work from
home. The semiconductor sector has stayed busy as the electronic system and system design continues
unabated. Driven by the sudden need for bandwidth and compute for home, be it for work, schooling
or entertainment, advanced chip design is not slowing down. We've seen this continuous design activity
in previous downturns. Regardless of where a company or industry is in its business cycle, continuous
investment in new technologies, be they AI and machine learning, 5G, IoT, automotive or cloud-end
markets, is the best way to be ready when the economy turns up again. Synopsys is at the core of this
enablement.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

Combining that with our time-based business model, our high level of recurring revenue and a
noncancelable backlog of $4.8 billion, Synopsys is well positioned to withstand the uncertainties of today's
macro environment. With that context, let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with
EDA. Our unrelenting innovation push throughout our Fusion Design Platform is driving momentum
in technical benchmark wins, increased competitive displacements and new breakthrough products.
In Q2, our hallmark Fusion Compiler product drove a doubling of the number of tapeouts as well as
significant business commitments by customers ranging from the world's largest microprocessor and
consumer companies to mobile, networking and automotive system designers. Key competitive wins
included a leading Asian 5G edge computing chip supplier for next-generation 5-nanometer design, a
prominent North American graphics company on an advanced gaming GPU and expanding competitive
displacement at some of the world's leading mobile semis on multiple designs ranging from 12-nanometer
to 5 nanometer. The Fusion concept, a revolutionary invention with impact that goes far beyond even the
breakthrough Fusion Compiler solution, resonates very well with our customers and partners. This quarter,
we expanded our collaboration with Broadcom, who is widely deploying our Fusion Design Platform to
accelerate delivery of its innovative 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer designs.

And our innovation continues at a rapid pace. In March, we announced several exciting new products,
including DSO.ai. The result of a multiyear initiative with leading industry partners, it includes learning
engines that can automatically adjust and optimize throughout the design flow. The result is impressive
productivity improvements in terms of project time as well as further optimizations in chip performance,
power and area. Using state-of-the-art AI and machine learning as well as a cloud-based burst
computation, it enables design teams to tackle more projects, handle larger parts of a project and lets
designers focus exclusively on leverage high creativity and value-added tasks.

Another seminal new product is a 3DIC Compiler. Advanced designs are now so massive and complex that
they require a brand-new approach. 3DIC Compiler is a single environment that enables the combination
of multiple die together on a chip. This provides far better performance and capacity than conventional
chip and package approaches for customers such as Samsung Electronics, who refer to it as an industry
disruptor. 3DIC is also a great way to extend the power, performance and density benefits of Moore's Law
as it supports the high-speed parallelism and massive data needs of new AI architectures. This opens a
new path to very powerful multi-die computational engines for years to come.

Meanwhile, in custom design, our multiyear innovation push has resulted in a highly competitive product
that is being used for the most advanced FinFET designs and driving ongoing full-flow competitive
displacements. For example, Alphawave replaced its legacy custom design tools with our custom design
platform for development of high-speed connectivity IP. Here too, productivity was the reward as our
solution helped them meet aggressive design targets in a notably shorter time frame. A major foundry in
Asia expanded its internal deployment and now has more than 10 custom compiler projects underway. We
also secured new deployments for memory, silicon IP and microprocessor designs.

Let me now move to our Verification Continuum Platform, where significant technology innovation
continues to cement our market share leadership. In verification software, we're seeing notable
expansions at influential hyperscaler companies, traditional semi and systems companies and global
start-ups. Across the platform, our technology is strong. On the hardware side of our verification
solution, which caters uniquely to unrelenting design complexity growth, demand for our products is
also high. Competitively, our emulators and prototyping systems are differentiated by raw speed, higher
reliability, easier installation and maintenance and overall lower cost of ownership. Just this quarter, 13
new customers purchased our hardware products, and we have more than 30 repeat orders. Here too,
we're seeing good momentum with customers ranging from very large semi and systems companies to
hyperscalers and start-ups. While the timing of hardware deliveries creates a tough comparison with the
first half of last year, we continue to gain momentum with both new and existing customers.

Now to IP, where we are growing with solid momentum. As the #1 provider of interface, embedded
memory, logic libraries and foundry specific IP, we provide the broadest portfolio addressing the most
complex requirements, accelerating time to market and lowering design risk. With more than 330 wins
for foundry specific 7-nanometer IP, customers are clearly placing their trust in our leadership in high-
performance cloud-computing applications. Most recently, we achieved significant competitive wins,

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

including a major Internet service as an AI company, who adopted our production proven IP subsystems
and PCI Express 5.0. And a major Taiwanese fabless semiconductor company who licensed our silicon
proven HBM2E for multiple networking customers.

Our unrelenting focus on enabling advanced process designs continues. We recently announced availability
of the broadest portfolio of IP for TSMC's 5-nanometer process for high-performance computing SoCs. A
multinational technology giant in cloud services and AI selected our PCI Express 5.0, CXL and Foundation
IP. And a leading e-commerce company chose our Die-to-Die HBI IP because of our performance, power
and area differentiation.

Our product momentum for ARC processors also continued with the introduction of our first 64 bit
processor IP. This is our highest performance ARC processor to date, targeting high-end embedded
applications such as storage, automotive control and infotainment.

Now to Software Integrity. This is one area of our business that felt more of an impact from COVID as
companies delayed business decisions while working to adapt to shelter-in-place mandates. While revenue
growth improved sequentially, we did see a slowdown in orders that will moderate our revenue growth
this year to the low double-digit range before returning to higher growth longer term. The breadth and
road map of our portfolio are uniquely well suited to serve today's DevSecOps requirements. By providing
high-value products, a great new platform and strategic consulting services, we are well positioned to help
companies develop more secure, high-quality software for a very interconnected world.

Industry recognition of our vision and product breadth has grown significantly over the past several
years. Just a few weeks ago, Gartner updated its Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing. We
are pleased to note that Synopsys is again at the farthest top right position in the leader quadrant. We
made progress during this quarter in several areas. We achieved multiple competitive displacements as
customers embraced the benefits of our broad portfolio and the integration onto the Polaris Software
Integrity Platform. We saw a notable broadening of agreements as customers expanded the number of
products they adopt. One example is a very large global electronics company who replaced the incumbent
and significantly expanded its adoption to a broader set of our solutions. This quarter, our customer
base continued to grow with new logos ranging from very well-known consumer electronics leaders to
hyperscalers, to industrial and financial services companies. Our next objective is to scale this business to
reach $500 million to $1 billion in revenue over time.

Before I hand it over to Trac, let me comment on our practical handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. I
will begin with a sincere thank you to the many southwest caregivers who keep us safe. I also want to
thank our employees, who have shown incredible commitment and agility over the past several months to
execute on the dual objectives of health and business. I believe that our execution during this period has
been stellar.

In addition to the rapid actions we took to implement global shelter-in-place orders, we continue to
partner with our peers, local governments and health agencies to ensure a safe work environment for
those returning to the office. Our IT, HR, facilities and operations teams have done an amazing job, quickly
adapting our infrastructure and systems to support work from home.

Our R&D teams continue to execute very well and have effectively worked through some hardware supply
chain and logical challenges. The large number of new products and excellent benchmark results give
us strong confidence in our product pipeline. This also applies to our worldwide IP team, which had the
foresight to rapidly enable remote development and delivery of high demand advanced titles. We are able
to ship our products and our customers

[Audio Gap]

support from our application engineering teams. Last, as witnessed by the strongest orders quarter on
record, our sales team also demonstrated stellar execution.

As we now see a gradual opening of businesses in many countries and states, our leadership is planning
a very gradual shift back to the office in coordination with local authorities and sensitive to our employees
well-being. In closing, Synopsys is executing well. We delivered outstanding second quarter results with

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

record orders, revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow. Design activity remains
strong and enduring. We continue to introduce innovative new products throughout our portfolio and our
benchmarking strongly. Notwithstanding the extraordinary world circumstances, we continue to target high
single-digit revenue growth, substantial ops margin expansion, mid-teens non-GAAP earnings per share
growth and strong operating cash flow.

Trac will now highlight the financial perspective.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. Our record results are especially noteworthy, in light of the
considerable challenges faced by ourselves and our customers over the past few months. Given our
history of strong execution, sometimes it's easy to forget how much hard work goes into delivering
results like these. So I'd like to add my thanks to our employees for their dedication under these
difficult circumstances. Complementing our excellent execution in the first half is our very solid business
foundation, technology leadership, a diverse customer base and nearly 90% recurring revenue. These
elements position us well for periods of high demand as well as during times of greater stress. This rare
combination gives us the confidence to reaffirm our annual revenue and non-GAAP margin guidance and
to increase our non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow targets.

Now to our second quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Orders
substantially exceeded our plan, driven in large part by EDA, particularly digital design. Ending backlog
was $4.7 billion. We generated total revenue of $861.3 million, above our target range, driven by broad
strength and some revenue that moved in from Q3. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue
was $773 million, with strong growth in EDA software, moderated by tough hardware comparison over a
strong Q2 of last year. Excluding hardware, EDA software results remain within our long-term target range
of mid- to high single digits.

A quick note on hardware. While COVID-19 has presented some minor house related supply chain
challenges due to shelter-in-place mandates, we're managing through them well. Our contract
manufacturing partners are gradually increasing capacity. And because our products are considered
essential, they are top priorities. Software Integrity segment revenue was $88.3 million, 10% of total.

Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $735 million, which includes approximately
$30 million in restructuring costs associated with our previously communicated program to optimize
resource allocation for sustainable long-term growth. These are not COVID related. Total non-GAAP costs
and expenses were $640 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.7%. We are on track
to generate approximately 2 percentage points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion for the year.
Adjusted operating margin for the Semiconductor & System Design segment was 27.1%. And for the
software integrity segment, 13.3%.

Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $0.71 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.22, well above our
target range due to excellent operational execution.

Turning to cash. We generated a record $380 million in the operating cash flow. We initiated a $100 million
ASR and have now completed $200 million in buybacks year-to-date. We've repurchased $2 billion of
our stock since 2015, approximately 75% of our free cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy has not
changed. We'll continue to evaluate the best use of cash each quarter and will remain prudent as the
global macro environment evolves. Our balance sheet is very strong. We entered the quarter -- we ended
the quarter with a cash balance of $856 million and total debt of $236 million as we paid down $90 million
of our revolver.

Now to guidance, which continues to assume the current entity list restrictions remain in place for the rest
of the year. Consistent with our expectations, revenue was skewed to later in the year due primarily to a
scheduled timing of hardware and IP deliveries.

For fiscal year 2020, our targets are: revenue of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion; total GAAP costs and
expenses between $2.99 billion and $3.03 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.63

billion and $2.66 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%; GAAP earnings
of $3.74 to $3.9 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $5.21 to $5.28 per share; cash flow from operations of
$815 million to $840 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $170 million.

Now to the targets for the third quarter: revenue between $875 million and $905 million; total GAAP costs
and expenses between $721 million and $737 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $640
million and $650 million; GAAP earnings of $1.12 to $1.22 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.33 to
$1.38 per share.

In conclusion, despite the unprecedented challenges faced by our employees and customers around the
globe, our focused execution, portfolio strength and resilient business model enabled us to deliver a very
strong quarter, reiterate our full year revenue and non-GAAP margin guidance and raise our non-GAAP
earnings and cash flow targets. Our strong balance sheet and thoughtful approach to capital allocation
position us well to navigate the current environment.
And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham &
Company.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats to the team on delivering very solid results in a challenging environment. First, just on the
order commentary, I think you said you saw stronger than expected orders primarily in core EDA. I was
wondering if you could give any color on sort of what drove that strength. And if you thought it was maybe
timing related? Or if you think that was sort of a net increase in demand relative to your original plan?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, I think there are multiple things have played in all at the same time. Obviously, in a time like this,
we all pay a lot of attention to execution. And so we'll give some credit to just working hard at it. But I
think the other thing that happened is that a number of the new products that we introduced last year
and some that we announced just recently are very attractive and benchmark extremely well. And so the
hunger for more sophisticated products continues because during the same time frame, what we're seeing
is that a number of the advanced customers are moving now from 7 to 5 nanometer. And so that has both
implications on the IP that they're using and on the strength of tools that they want. And so the demand, I
think, was absolutely there, and it was for us to make sure that we find a way to get at it.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And just one more on the SIG business. One, could you say what the bookings were there? I know
they were pretty good last quarter despite the relatively modest revenue growth. And two, any progress
on getting a business unit, a new business unit head there?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

So we normally don't disclose the bookings for any subpart of the company. We did communicate that they
were lower this quarter than expected, and therefore, that has some ramifications going forward. It's not
completely a surprise because a lot of the interactions early on in the COVID time were very impacted by
people essentially hustling for shelter or from home. On the recruiting, we have started a search. And so
we expect that in the next 6 months this will be fulfilled. And now we're looking at candidates.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Congrats again on a nice quarter.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Thank you very much, Rich.

Operator

Next we turn to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

Maybe first a question on the hardware business. At this point, is that completely outsourced? Or do you
still do -- or do you do a final assembly and test in-house? And just curious if COVID was a bigger issue
for your suppliers or for your own internal assembly and test.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, it's an excellent question. So we do a little bit of all of that. We outsource, obviously, as much as
we possibly can. There are -- depending on what the status is of the hardware, we assemble some of it
ourselves. And as you would expect, when you have a global disruption of all the markets, initially, you
have to watch out where all the parts are coming from, who is doing the assembly, et cetera. And the
issues that we looked at initially were HAPS related. I'm quite impressed by how quickly our team was on
top of that. And after that, the fact that this is essential equipment benefited us as the assembly people
we work with gave us high priority. And so I think the problem is mostly resolved at this point in time.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. That's great to hear. And then Trac, when I look at the midpoint of guidance for, I guess, the third
and the implied for the fourth quarter, pretty strong revenue growth, not a lot of model leverage off that
revenue growth though. I'm curious is that because it's more hardware centric? Is it conservatism or is
there something else going on?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

It is a little bit of the hardware mix. You got COGS ramping up with expenses as well. And the profile
is that it does have some additional expenses in terms of hiring. But I do expect that you'll see an
improvement in operating margins from Q3 to Q4.

Operator

And next we turn to the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.

Joseph D. Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Apologies if this came up. I joined a little bit late, but just a current events question. I'm wondering if the
recent proposals around new export restrictions have either impacted Synopsys any way or maybe since
the April quarter close, caused some of your customers maybe to reconsider certain spending decisions.
Or just any impacts from the past couple of weeks and some of the news that's been coming out?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, the bottom line of the answer is, no. The recent announcements were 1 or 2 weeks old. And while
fairly complicated, we're able to get a good sense of it. And our conclusion is it does not affect us beyond
what is already prohibited in the entity. We have also not had any follow on of customers that we're
worried in any form. So I think that interpretation has been fairly universal.

Joseph D. Vruwink
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then on Software Integrity, I guess the qualitative commentary just in terms of some of
the buy in to Polaris and the fact that you're getting competitive displacements for Polaris at this point,
that strikes me as pretty positive. So I guess my question is, did it surprise you to have platform traction
in a more difficult environment created by COVID? And does that give you maybe some optimism and
thinking about bookings for the back half of your year?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

Well, we live with optimism, and actually, this is a good example of it because the whole point of a
platform is to get the benefit of multiple tools that work well together. And by the way, for the buyer, it
has another benefit, especially for larger companies. They are trying to maintain an environment that is
not overly complex with tools from many, many different vendors. And so being able to bring multiple
capabilities together in a structured fashion that over time will gain more and more value because things
work well together is actually precisely the direction that we are counting on. And the fact that a number
of customers have actually bought Synopsis precisely for that reason is extremely encouraging.

Operator

And next we turn to the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I wanted to focus a little bit on the -- hello? Can you hear me?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Yes. We can hear you.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Yes. Sorry. Yes, so I wanted to focus a bit on the operating margin here. So the implied number, it looks
like you guys are going to get to the kind of the high 20s exiting the year. So I really have 2 parts to
my question. The first one is just that is that correct that you're going to kind of exit at 29%? And then
secondly, does that imply that '21 should actually be better than your high 20s target? Because now you
guys have kind of got a work-from-home dynamic, you don't have to have as much T&E expense. It's
something we've heard that a lot of companies, particularly software companies are able to do. So is there
any way you guys are going to be able to squeeze extra basis points out of the OpEx line going forward?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Let me work backwards on your question, Mitch. You're right. We are -- we would be exiting in the high
20s for the year. But keep in mind that it's largely a profile of the revenue ramp. We remain committed to
our long-term goals of driving margin expansion. But at this point, it's too early to talk about FY '21. We'll
comment on that later in the year. As far as savings from COVID, certainly, we're seeing some elements
of that flow through -- that benefit flow through to the results. But the results are largely driven by us
executing the plan that we set out to do for the year, which is continue to focus on our spending, be more
diligent about where we're investing and driving a plan that's going to deliver good margin growth this
year and over time.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And then just one small one, if I could, I know I've asked multiple questions there. So just was
there any revenue impact you guys could quantify in terms of what the hardware shipments would have
been? Or if you had any pushouts in terms of sales? Because I'm curious to why the full year guide didn't
go up. I would think that you'd be able to get at least above -- towards the high end, I guess, the revenue
guide. So was there any sort of push out or anything related to COVID in the quarter?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

No, not really. COVID had a really small effect on the results or immaterial effect on the financial results.
As we mentioned, we had some initial challenges with the supply chain when the shelter-in-place
mandates went into effect, but we were able to overcome that and execute on the numbers for the

quarter. Good execution in Q2. The results were strong on its own, but we did see some revenues move
in from Q3 to Q2. At this point, we're providing our best view of the outlook for hardware, and it really
reflects a profile of it growing in Q4. And so far, we feel confident in our ability to execute to that. That's
why we're reaffirming guidance.

Operator

And next we turn to the line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan.

Jackson Edmund Ader
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

The first one to Aart is a follow-up actually on some of the trade restrictions. You addressed, I think, the
entity list and Huawei's, I guess, tighter restrictions having already been factored in. But what about the
military end user or military end-use case, I guess, control actions that were put out at the end of April?
Do you expect any impacts from that?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

No, we don't. So fundamentally, the guidance that we have given you encompasses all of our
interpretation of all of the various actions that have been taken over the last 1.5 years. And I think we feel
very solid in that interpretation at this point in time.

Jackson Edmund Ader
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. All right. Great. And then follow-up. Yes, just quickly on cash flows. Are customers -- are there any
customers either in Software Integrity or in the Semiconductor business that are looking for maybe some
payment flexibility? I saw that the provisions for doubtful accounts went up. But just curious where the
strength in cash flow is expected to come from.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. For the most part, we haven't seen any meaningful impact of that or of customers coming back and
renegotiating terms. And so far, that's been very positive. We're prepared to -- we're prepared for that
kind of potential. But so far, we haven't seen much of an impact. The strength in the cash flow outlook is
really the confidence in the P&L and what we're guiding to, it's pretty solid growth for the year as well as
good margin improvement, and that's going to eventually translate to cash, and it's a reflection of both
strong collections and more effective disbursements or lower disbursement.

And next we turn to the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Let me extend my congratulations as well. The 7% sequential increase in backlog is commendable. And --
but reading between the lines, I see that your average license duration is spiked quite significantly. And so
does that speak to, I guess, the concentration of the record orders with perhaps one customer renewal?
Or is there some more diverse overall bookings trend there?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

It is the second. It's not a single customer at all, it is multiple customers. I think in general, there are
often variations in length of contracts. At this point in time, it is encouraging that the contracts have not
become shorter as in times of economic stress, people could be worried about it. That's obviously not be
the case at all. And I said, from a use and approach to design, we see no difference. If nothing else, there

are a number of companies that are really accelerating as they hope to have good opportunities in next
year with new products. So the technology advances are on track and the business, I think, reflects that
directly.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Gary, I would also add that the -- it's nice to have at the back that large backlog in an environment like
this, in general, but particularly in an environment like this. Now the Q2 bookings was not only a record in
absolute numbers, but we also saw a very good run rate growth in the quarter. So I'm pleased with that
combination.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And as my follow-up question, with the shelter in place, I guess, largely still intact there in the Bay
Area and perhaps affecting access to your facilities in access to labs and whatnot. Is that a hindrance to
completion of some IP deliverables? Is that perhaps an explanation why the fourth quarter may be so
back-end loaded?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, initially, there were a number of questions of how to best get access to labs. How to manage that?
Can we manage it? I think there too, we were able to find practical solutions pretty quickly. And I'm
actually very positively surprised that how well the IP group is executing as we continue to send chips to
manufacturing as we can -- as we continue to deliver new cores. And so I think the distribution of revenue
is more a function of the uptakes from the customer than anything else.

Operator

And next we turn to line of Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America.

Adam Gonzalez
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

First on the Software Integrity business. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on some of the delayed
business decisions that you alluded to on -- in the prepared remarks. And then what gives you the
confidence in the low double-digit growth target that you implied the business would grow this year? And
then secondly, how have your sales efforts been impacted by the shelter-in-place orders in SIG? And have
your spending plans changed at all versus what they were last quarter?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Yes. Let me go backward on that. As the working at home started to become -- acted on with many of
our customers, it did slow the interaction somewhat. We also saw some slowdown in our ability to hire
people as quickly as we had planned. And those are the type of things that then tend to impact the orders,
rates that one gets in. And so one can certainly always point at things that we could do better on the
circumstances. But all in all, the reception to the type of capabilities that we have and the need have
not diminished at all. As a matter of fact, you can see how a wave of concern has gone through many
of our customers as they established work from home and immediately, the security of many of those
installations was somewhat in question. Now we ourselves barely touched that -- that is not the field
that we're in. But the secondary ramification of that is that people will look again harder at what to do
in the software to protect from future security breaches. So from that perspective, I think the business
opportunity is just as healthy as it was before. The circumstances will evolve. And I think our execution
can improve and that's what we're focusing on.

SYNOPSYS, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 20, 2020

Great. And then my follow-up, just generally speaking, do you see any read across to the EDA industry
more broadly from the duplication of semis and tech supply chain that we seem to be progressing toward?
Just asking following up on TSMC's decisions to build a fab in Arizona.

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the first -- you said something across, but I'm not sure what the something was.

Adam Gonzalez
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Do you see any read across the EDA industry broadly from the duplication of supply chain efforts with U.S.
and China?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

That is an interesting question because whenever supply chain start to duplicate efforts, they actually
become less efficient, which is actually not a bad thing for the people supplying to them in turn. And so
I don't think that we see an enormous amount of effort in that yet. But clearly, there are sort of fairly
big macro discussions on different countries wanting to have a high degree of independence of other
countries, all the way to manufacturing of semiconductors, as you saw per the recent announcements of
TSMC. And so I think that we're going to see a fairly dynamic evolution over the next year. And given that
we're connected to all of those people very well. I certainly intend for us to participate in whatever they're
going to build and whatever they need to construct in a fashion that is good for our business.

Operator

And next we turn to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.

Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division

Aart, needless to say, the comments about record orders was quite important and the same about record
backlog. If I'm not mistaken, the last quarterly record for bookings was 7 years ago. The question is, how
will this momentum in in EDA influence or your direction or allocation of internal resources? Normally,
when we see that kind of strength in EDA, again, driven by demand and new product adoption, we would
see, for instance, a significant ramping up of AE capacity as a coincidental or leading indicator for that kind
of strength in EDA. So perhaps you could talk about that kind of internal investment you're thinking of
incrementally for EDA? And conversely, what you might be doing differently in terms of SIG investments
as you go through this slower period of growth and maybe Trac can comment a little bit more elaborately
on the -- yes, the restructuring intent? And then my second question is back on EDA. You, in the last year
on a couple of conversations we've had, spoke about 2 big trends, driving the EDA industry. One was
moving from the general to the specific or specialty chips, as you call them, and that the next big thing
in EDA was, as you described it, prototyping, broadly speaking, at different levels of abstraction. I'm sure
you remember those comments, is there any way to parse how either or both of those is directly having a
business impact incrementally versus, let's say, older forms of design or older methods?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Okay. I will try to answer that in less than half an hour. Let me start with the very good results from an
order perspective. And frankly, I didn't know that was 7 years ago. At that time, we were more colored by
single large customers making an impact. This was much broader.

Nonetheless, when we entered the global pandemic crisis, it became instantaneously clear that there were
more questions than answers of what this would do to the market, to the behavior of the customers and
so on. And it was also instantaneously clear to Synopsys that it was all hands on deck to make sure that
we maintain strong relationships with the customers, first from a support point of view to make sure that

they do well. And secondly, from the perspective of continuing to bring in the business in order for us to
be able to fund however long the downturn may be.

We executed on that clearly well. And as mentioned, I think one of the very early questions today, I think,
partially it is because we focus extremely well, but also because we are at a good time with new products
and new necessities from a design point of view, such as the new nodes, the advanced technologies, the
increase of IP reuse, et cetera.

And so we will continue to manage the way we've always done, which is we committed to you -- to
obviously optimize the growth rate, but also to work towards the ops margin improvement, and this helps
in the right direction.

But this also ties to your next question, which is, what are the key trends behind this from a technology
point of view. And what I must have called many years ago, specialty chips, now we would call AI and
machine learning chips because that is really the whole generation that has completely readdressed
architectures.

And it's important to understand just a little bit why that is relevant to us because no matter what,
when you do computing engines, such as for AI, you want speed, speed, speed, except these computing
engines are extremely large machines of parallel small processors with very big data rates and often a big
bandwidth. And so there, every company that is invested in that is doing their own thing and trying to be
differentiated. And so they are truly specialty chips.

And what is particularly interesting is a number of these are now splitting into multiple chips and that is
why 3DIC Compiler is such an interesting product. Because after many, many years of worrying about
Moore's Law may be slowing down a little bit, and it has slowed down somewhat, although it's much more
alive than people think, this is a great answer if one can go to multiple chips that are extremely well
connected. And so the specialty chips, as you call them, are the architectures that are precisely driving the
notion of bringing more chips together.

Now in that context, the prototyping is just as relevant because the other half of a product is the software
that runs in it. And the more complex these specialty chips are, the more complex the software is and
the more there is risk that the software doesn't work when the chip comes out or that the chip doesn't --
wasn't quite responsive to the software it was intended to be on.

That is where prototyping sits in the middle. It allows people to check and run their software before they
actually have the hardware. And so I expect that we will see continued attention and growth to this and
certainly, we are investing strongly in these areas.

So bottom line is nobody will ever argue that strong orders is not a good thing. Obviously, we have to
execute now in the next few quarters. We'll see what the global economy does. I think that semiconductor
is actually in a good spot, relatively speaking to most other markets, and we have not seen a slowdown.

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Jay, in addition to that, to your question regarding the restructuring, we're committed, and we remain on
path to driving margins up over time. In addition to that, we'll continue to invest in the business because
all of the segments that we're in, we're seeing good growth opportunities. The restructuring is really a
reflection of fine-tuning the investments and making sure that we're placing heavier bets in the areas
where we think we can get the best combination of growth and profitability.

First question, maybe Trac, can you maybe go into the comments around the pull forward of some
revenues from Q3? Was this more on the EDA side or the hardware side?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

Mostly on the EDA side. What we saw in EDA, particularly in Q2, was just a few shorter contracts, they're
FSAs. And so we saw that benefit. And that's why you might see a little bit higher on the time base
relative to the upfront. But overall, the profile for the year, there is really good growth and strength across
the board.

Jason Vincent Celino
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Great. And then my follow-up, the SIG margins did increase 300 basis points, probably the highest SIG
margins that you reported since breaking that segment out. How much of this was from the restructuring,
maybe the slower hiring? And then would you look to prioritize managing profitability for this segment,
while the growth profile is a little more challenged?

Trac Pham
Chief Financial Officer

It's a little bit of all those things that you described, you're right. The margins did come up to around
13%. We mentioned at the beginning of the year that we were going to try to invest further in that
business to invest for growth. I think we're still committed to that plan. And the profile from margins will
kind of vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on the ramp up in expenses. I would extrapolate that out
to the full year or as a new plan, we'll continue to balance investing the business while making sure it fits
into the overall company. So…

Our -- next we turn to the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Aart, quick question just going back to China. I appreciate all the color you gave on the recent Huawei
licensing news from last week and the military use. But I'm just kind of curious, just given how critical
EDA is to the software to the semiconductor ecosystem and China's desire to kind of build that system out,
you guys become a really important sort of pawn on the geopolitical sort of chessboard. And so I'm kind
of curious, you break out Asia Pacific revenue, but you don't break out China revenue specifically. Can you
help us kind of just ballpark that? And I guess as you look inside of China, what percent of the customers
are you supporting in China today that if for some reason you couldn't, that demand would probably get
soaked up somewhere else, i.e., Huawei can't ship into phones, but maybe MediaTek and Qualcomm can?
And to what percent of the Chinese customers do you think are maybe a lot of start-ups that if you're not
shipping to them that demand probably doesn't go elsewhere?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Well, this is a very difficult hypothetical question because there's so many geopolitical forces de facto
in play at the same time. I can tell you that so far, a number of companies have picked up very quickly

where others could not develop themselves. And I expect that to continue because after all, globally
speaking, it's a very open market, and people jump in when there's an opportunity one way or another.
And so really since the entity list came about, which was May last year, we obviously have learned how
to live with that and really have not felt much change. Growth continues well in China. Actually, growth
continues well overall in the world, but China, particularly. And there are many, many companies that are
jumping in both there as well as in other parts of the globe.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe for a follow-up, just back to SIG. I'm just kind of making sure I
understand this. Is the growth sort of slowdown here a function of your inability to actually bring on new
headcount and drive channel growth there? Or is it actual customer activity? And I guess I'm asking the
question, I'm just trying to get a better sense of why the confidence that once we get through this COVID
phenomenon growth will reaccelerate there. What metrics are you looking at to support that view?

Aart J. de Geus
Co-Founder, Chairman & Co-CEO

Sure. Well, I think the most objective answer has to be that it's a combination of the 2. Meaning that,
yes, we did see a slowdown as a number of customers just have been sidetracked into their own survival
challenges in different ways. And that tends to slow down this type of investment. At the same time, and
you saw a little bit of that in our commenting that our hiring was slower than planned. That is our own
execution that is in question. So bottom line is, we will need to put -- continue to put effort in bringing
this part of Synopsys into a very good profile, and we're doing exactly that. Now what gives confidence,
what gives confidence is that the problem is not shrinking at all, and the solution that we have is getting
better and better. Now you say, well, that in itself doesn't give you money, but yes, you're right, we have
to work for that. But the problem will continue to grow. And it will continue to grow because so many
electronic systems are much more intertwined than they were before. And that will continue to happen in
the present pathway that electronics is on. Therefore, there will be needed more assurances that the sub
pieces have built in security in a variety of ways. That certainly is massively the case on software. But as a
side note, will also increasingly be the case on the hardware side.

So there's nothing that has changed in our opinion of this being a good market, a technically challenging,
therefore, a particularly good market for us. And the combination of the overall situation and perhaps
our own execution gave us -- led us to this point. But let's not underestimate, this is actually a very good
business for Synopsys. It is now growing a bit slower than we wanted this year, but it is well on track to
have a good future.
