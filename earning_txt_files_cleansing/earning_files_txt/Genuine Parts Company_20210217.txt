At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Sid Jones, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Please go ahead, sir.

Sidney G. Jones
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the Genuine Parts Company Fourth Quarter and
Full Year 2020 Conference Call. With me today are Paul Donahue, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer; Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Will Stengel, our newly

As a reminder, today's conference call and webcast includes a slide presentation that can be found on the

release issued this morning, which is also posted in the Investors section of our website.

Today's call may also involve forward-looking statements regarding the company and its businesses.
The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several
important factors described in the company's latest SEC filings, including this morning's press release. The
company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.

Finally, consistent with the prior 2 quarters, we've accounted for the business products segment, S.P.

Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for his remarks.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Sid, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings
conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and hope you're all staying safe and well.

Our fourth quarter results reflect the benefit of our ongoing strategic actions despite the continued
challenges of COVID-19. The GPC team was agile in adapting to dynamic conditions and executed on our
initiatives to deliver customer value, operational efficiencies and strong financial results. We are grateful to
our 50,000 associates for their unwavering commitment to excellence, while responding to unprecedented
business and economic conditions, which have continued for nearly 12 months. Our operational focus is on
ensuring a safe work environment, supporting our talented workforce and further strengthening our strong
culture.

In January, we are pleased to promote Will Stengel, the President, and we now welcome Will to this
quarterly call. As our Chief Transformation Officer since 2019, Will helped our business units work
to achieve a variety of strategic initiatives and significant cost savings in 2020. Will's vast skill set
and relevant experience in his previous career with HD Supply, have added tremendous value to our
management team. His exceptional talent, proven leadership and experience make Will an excellent choice
as our company's next president, and we look forward to his future contributions. You will hear from both
Will and Carol later in the call, and then we'll take your questions.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

So now turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Total sales for the quarter were $4.3 billion, down
1% due in part to the continued challenges of COVID-19. While our automotive sales were strong in Asia
Pac, the pace of recovery slowed in Europe and North America relative to the previous quarter. Industrial
sales grew progressively stronger during the final 3 months of 2020 and were much improved from
the prior 2 quarters. We further improved gross margin. And in fact, the fourth quarter was our 13th
consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. In addition, we successfully took action to reduce costs,
lowering our year-over-year operating expenses.

For the quarter, we generated an additional $40 million in permanent cost savings and realized another
$40 million in temporary savings related to our response to COVID-19. Our progress in these areas drove
a 14% increase in total operating profit and an 8.8% operating margin. This 110 basis point improvement
in operating margin from the fourth quarter of 2019 was supported by margin expansion in both the
automotive and industrial segments.

Our strong operating performance drove adjusted net income of $221 million and adjusted earnings per
share of $1.52, up 20%. Due to ongoing working capital and debt financing initiatives, we also finished the
quarter and year with a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and robust cash flow with $2 billion in cash
from operations in 2020.

Turning now to our business segments. Automotive represented 66% of total sales in the fourth quarter,
and industrial was 34%. By region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America, with 16%
in Europe and 11% in Asia Pac. Total sales for the global automotive group were $2.8 billion, a 1%
increase from 2019 with comp sales down 2%. Segment profit margin was up 130 basis points, driven by
improvement in each of our automotive operations.

Fourth quarter sales were led by strong growth in Asia Pac, with continued retail and commercial sales
momentum driving a second consecutive quarter of mid-teen sales comps. The Asia Pac team performed
well all year and deserves a special shout out on their exceptional results. So congratulations and a big
thank you to Rob Cameron and the entire automotive team down under.

In Europe and North America, the surge in COVID cases led to more restrictions on mobility and mild
weather through most of the quarter pressured sales of seasonal items. A second lockdown in November
significantly slowed sales activity across Europe, although sales gradually improved through December,
driving flat comps for the quarter.

We would add as well that despite the challenging conditions in Europe overall, our U.K. operations
continued to outperform with solid results for the quarter. Additionally, the positive impact of our cost
savings initiatives more than offset the sales pressure, and the European team produced a 100 basis point
operating margin improvement. This caps a strong recovery in Europe's operating performance over the
second half of 2020.

In North America, our U.S. automotive total sales and comp sales declined approximately 6%. Despite
the sales decrease, the U.S. team generated a 200 basis point improvement in operating profit margin. In
Canada, quarterly sales were down slightly. Comp sales declined 2% and and operating margin improved
by 40 basis points. Growth in sales to our retail customers continued to outperform expectations, while
sales to the DIFM segment remain challenged. Through the quarter, DIY sales were strong, driven by
COVID-related shifts in consumer behavior and stimulus payments and stronger NAPA sales positioning,
resulting from several key initiatives. These include our ongoing store refreshes, investment retail
specialists, the benefit of our NAPA Rewards Program with 12.5 million active members, targeted
promotions and enhanced merchandising initiatives. In addition, our growing omnichannel capabilities,
including direct-to-customer shipping from select suppliers, enabled our team to double our online sales
volume from pre pandemic levels. DIFM sales were down from 2019 as a slow recovery in miles driven,
mild temperatures and continued pressure in our large fleet and government customer segment, weighed
on sales demand. To address these declines and build positive momentum in 2021 and our team is
focused on several initiatives, including maximizing sales force effectiveness by repurposing our field
resources and doubling the number of professional salespeople calling directly on our end customers. The
professional repair garages.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Continued enhancement of our industry-leading commercial programs and promotions for the professional
customer, including NAPA AutoCare and AutoPro. Improving our inventory availability, utilize and enhanced
analytics to ensure more parts or more cars across our store network, strengthening our supply chain,
focusing on our global supplier relationship as well as ensuring we have multiple suppliers by category.
While we are seeing gradual improvement with supply chain service issues, there is more work yet to be
done. And finally, further optimizing our network, including DC consolidations, increasing automation in
our facilities and additional daily shuttles.

In 2021, we will also continue to execute on several global initiatives and invest in our omnichannel
strategy, both B2B and B2C to enhance and build new digital catalog and search capabilities, implement
strategic pricing initiatives, focus on value-added services and continue our rollout of the NAPA brand
in Europe and Australasia. We also have plans to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-
on acquisitions, changeovers and new greenfield stores to enhance our competitive positioning across
our automotive operations. These initiatives are designed to deliver customer value, sell more parts and
capture market share.

To that end, we are pleased to report a strong start in 2021, with January, average daily sales up low
double digits in the U.S. and for our global automotive group. Backing out the positive impact of FX and
acquisition revenues, comp sales were up high single digits in January. We would add that we continue to
see little impact of price inflation in our sales, although we expect to see more supplier increases in the
coming months and quarters, possibly in the 1% to 3% range for the full year.

So in summary, we believe improving product availability, colder winter weather in North America and
Europe and the gradual reopening up the economy are current tailwinds for automotive business. In
addition, favorable industry fundamentals, a growing total vehicle fleet, an increase in vehicles aged 6
to 12 years, and expectation for the gradual recovery in miles driven give us confidence in our growth
expectations for 2021 despite the ongoing uncertainties due to COVID-19.

So now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group. Total sales for this group were $1.4 billion, down
3.3% from last year. Comp sales were down 4.4%, a significant improvement from the 9% decrease in
Q3 and the 17% decrease we saw back in Q2. The steady recovery in sales over the last half of 2020 is
consistent with the gradual improvement in the industrial economy, which is evident in indicators such as
the Purchasing Managers Index and industrial production. Strengthening conditions, combined with our
ongoing initiatives to drive growth and lower cost resulted in a 70 basis point improvement in segment
profit margin and our strongest quarterly return on sales since the fourth quarter of 2007.

Sales in North America and Australasia showed similar sales trends for the fourth quarter overall, although
December was the strongest month in the quarter in North America. In addition, most key product
categories achieved positive sales growth in December with improved month-to-month sales trends among
virtually all the industries we serve. We expect to build on these favorable trends in 2021.

As we move forward into 2021, which is Motion's 75th year in business, the industrial team will continue
to execute on strategic initiatives to drive profitable sales growth, improve operational productivity
and deliver customer value. These initiatives include building out our omnichannel capabilities to drive
organic sales, optimize the value of the Motion website and accelerate e-commerce growth, growing
our services and solutions business to expand our expertise in areas such as repair, conveyance and
automation; ongoing disciplined M&A to further boost our products and service offerings, while expanding
our global footprint and market presence; enhancing our global pricing and product category management
strategies to ensure sales excellence, margin effectiveness and a product offering that evolves the Motion
brand globally; and optimizing our global distribution network, the enhanced automation and facility
rationalization to lower cost, improve productivity and deliver excellent customer service.

We are confident that our focus on these key initiatives will optimize our competitive positioning as the
industrial markets recover to full capacity. We are encouraged to see releases of capital project orders
that were on hold throughout most of 2020, which is a positive sign for our greater plant activity in the
months and quarters ahead. In addition, we are pleased that our supplier service levels are strong despite
extended lead times on select items, and our inventories are in good position to meet expected growing
demand.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Finally, we currently expect another year of reasonable 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers,
which compares to inflation of just under 1% in 2020. For additional perspective, we experienced positive
sales momentum in January, with average daily sales up 2% for the month. This is better than the sales
trends we reported in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 and is a testament to the great work done by
the entire industrial team. So despite the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 and its uncertain impact on
the global economy and our markets, we are confident in our plans for the Industrial segment and look
forward to a strong 2021.

So let me conclude by providing an update on our ESG initiatives. At GPC, we embrace our responsibility
to innovate in ways that also benefit our environment, our associates and the communities in which
we operate. Our ESG practices, including human capital management and diversity and inclusion, are
discussed in our 2020 corporate sustainability report. In addition, our Board of Directors adopted a formal
human rights policy, which communicates the company's commitment to upholding human rights in every
location in which we operate as well as our expectation that our suppliers, partners and affiliates also
respect human rights. Our company-wide commitment to sustainability is integral to our corporate growth
strategy. We invite you to visit our GPC website to view these documents and learn more about our ESG
initiatives.

So with that, I'll turn it over to Will for his remarks. Will?

William P. Stengel
President

Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. First, I want to say that I'm incredibly proud to be a part of
Genuine Parts Company. The company has an impressive history of success, and it's an honor to be on the
GPC leadership team. I'd like to thank Paul and the Board for their vote of confidence. As Paul mentioned,
I joined the company in late 2019 as Chief Transformation Officer. Previously, I held executive leadership
positions at HD Supply, including time as President and CEO of HD Supply facilities maintenance, and
various other strategy and operating roles. My experience in distribution-related businesses fits well with
GPC's portfolio, business model and strategic initiatives, where consistent profitable growth, operating
leverage, strong cash conversion and disciplined capital allocation are all key value drivers, with the
dividend an especially important part of the GPC capital allocation strategy.

I'm excited about the future potential of Genuine Parts Company. Each of our GPC businesses enjoy
leadership positions within attractive fragmented markets with scale and capabilities to win. We have
leading global brands and long-standing relationships based on reliable customer service and value-added
expertise. And our unique culture that is based on a clear set of core values and purpose, serves as an
important common foundation.

Strategic actions taken in 2020 accelerated the transformation momentum built over recent years as we
work to simplify the business and further define our critical focus areas. The global teams executed well
as we navigated the pandemic and demonstrated an ability to act quickly and deliver results. Our strategic
actions provided clarity for areas where we want to increase our focus, including profitable organic growth,
driving operating productivity through simplification and integration, disciplined and strategic capital
deployment and investments in talent to develop and build capabilities.

Despite a challenging and unprecedented year, our diverse businesses proved resilient and built solid
momentum as we enter 2021. In my new role, I look forward to working with Paul and the global
leadership team as we align resources within our focus areas to execute these initiatives and deliver
value as a team. I'm also looking forward to spending time in our operations and with our customers and
suppliers.

In addition, we'll continue to further refine and advance our longer-term strategic road map. We're excited
about the numerous potential opportunities that new technologies and emerging trends could present for
GPC. As we look to the future, we feel well positioned to execute our strategic priorities to the benefit of
all our stakeholders, and I look forward to working with the leadership team to drive results.

Thank you, and I'll now turn it to Carol for her comments.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Thank you, Will. As a reminder, our comments this morning primarily focus on adjusted results from
continuing operations, which excludes restructuring, inventory, transaction and other costs and income.
We will begin with a review of our key financial information and then provide our full year outlook for
2021.

Total GPC sales were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 0.7% from 2019. For the full year, sales were
$16.5 billion, down 5.6% or down 2.3%, excluding divestitures. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter
was 35%, a 40 basis point improvement compared to 34.6% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full
year, adjusted gross margin improved 100 basis points to 34.5% from 33.5% in 2019.

Our team has been focused on a number of margin-enhancing initiatives and the fourth quarter and full
year gains represent the 13th consecutive quarter and the fifth consecutive year of improved gross margin
for the company.

Our steady progress in expanding gross margin in the quarter and the year reflects a variety of factors,
including the favorable impact of sales mix shifts to higher gross margin operations, positive product
mix shifts, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and strategic category
management initiatives. In addition, the full year gross margin also benefited from acquisitions and
divestitures, which impacted our results through the 9 months. We would add these positive factors were
partially offset by a decrease in supplier incentives due to lower purchasing volumes.

And finally, as we assess the pricing environment in the fourth quarter and 2020 overall, there was
minimal impact of price inflation in our sales and gross margins. As Paul mentioned earlier, we'll see how
this plays out in 2021, but we have not had any impact of inflation to this point in the year.

Our adjusted selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 2.8%
from last year and representing 26.6% of sales compared to 27.2% last year. For the year, these expenses
were $4.4 billion, down 3.9% compared to last year and 26.5% of sales compared to 26% in 2019. The
decrease in operating expenses for the fourth quarter and full year reflect the favorable impact of our
permanent and COVID-related cost actions implemented throughout 2020, as previously discussed.

As mentioned on our third quarter conference call, in accordance with our 2019 $100 million cost savings
plan, we successfully achieved the $100 million annual target ahead of schedule. We are pleased to report
an incremental $40 million in savings recognized in the fourth quarter and $150 million in permanent
expense reductions for 2020. In addition, our team continued to execute on a number of additional
savings initiatives in response to the impact of COVID-19. These initiatives contributed temporary cost
savings of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter and $300 million for the full year.

Combined, we generated approximately $80 million in total savings during the fourth quarter and
approximately $450 million for the full year, driven by transformative reductions in payroll and facility
costs as well as temporary savings from furloughs, reduced travel and entertainment, government
subsidies and other initiatives in response to COVID. We expect our permanent cost savings to carry over
into 2021, and we'll continue to manage our expenses to further improve our cost structure and operating
performance.

Our total operating and nonoperating expenses were an adjusted $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, down
3.4% from last year. This represents 28.1% of sales, down 80 basis points from 28.9% in 2019. For the
full year, these expenses were an adjusted $4.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year and representing
28.4% of sales.

Our total segment profit in the fourth quarter was $374 million, up 14% on a 1% sales decrease and our
segment profit margin was 8.8% compared to 7.7% last year for a strong increase of 110 basis points.
For the full year, segment profit was $1.3 billion, up 3% compared to 2019, and our segment profit margin
was 8.2% compared to 7.8% in the prior year. This represents our strongest full year segment profit
margin since 2015.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

We had net interest expense of $21 million in the fourth quarter. And for 2020, net interest was $91
million, which is essentially flat from 2019. In 2021, we expect net interest of $70 million to $72 million,
which is down from 2020 due to lower interest rates related to our new debt agreements negotiated in the
fourth quarter as well as the expectation for lower debt levels. The corporate expense line was $33 million
in the fourth quarter, down from $37 million in 2019 and for the year, these expenses were $150 million.
We currently expect our corporate expense to be in the $150 million range again in 2021.

Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.1%, an increase from 24.6% in the prior year period.
For the year, our adjusted tax rate was 24.5% and in line with 2019. We are planning for a full year tax
rate for 2021 in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%.

Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was $172 million with earnings per share of $1.18.
Adjusted net income was $221 million or $1.52 per share, which compares to $186 million or $1.27 per
share in 2019 or a 20% increase. For the full year, reported net income was $163 million or $1.13 per
share, and adjusted net income was $765 million or $5.27 per share.

So now let's discuss our fourth quarter results by segment. Our automotive revenue for the fourth quarter
was $2.8 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Segment profit of $240 million was up 19%, with profit
margin at 8.5% compared to a 7.2% margin in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 130 basis point increase in
margin was driven by improved operating results across each of our automotive businesses for the second
consecutive quarter. So an excellent job of operating by our automotive team, and we look forward to
continue progress in 2021.

Our industrial sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, a 3.3% decrease from Q4 of 2019 and significantly
improved from the sales declines in the second and third quarter. Segment profit of $133 million was up
5% from 1 year ago. And the profit margin was up 70 basis points to 9.3% compared to 8.6% last year.
The improved margin for industrial reflects gains in both our North American and Australasian industrial
businesses for the second consecutive quarter, so strong operating results for industrial, which we expect
to continue in 2021.

So now I will turn our comments to the balance sheet. We continue to closely manage our accounts
receivable, inventory and accounts payable to improve our working capital position. In the fourth quarter,
we sold $300 million in receivables for a total of $800 million sold in 2020 under an accounts receivable
sales agreement. Our total accounts receivable is down 36% from 2019, and we remain pleased with
the quality of our receivables. Our inventory at December 31, 2020, was up 2% from the prior year and
accounts payable increased 5%, improving our AP to inventory ratio to 118% in 2020 from 114% in 2019.

We are pleased with the progress our team is making to strengthen our supply chain. And in 2020, these
key accounts were a source of cash from operations, and our total working capital was 7% of revenues.
We repaid $230 million of debt in the fourth quarter and our total debt of $2.7 billion at December 31,
2020, is down $749 million or 22% from the $3.4 billion in 2019. During the fourth quarter, we further
improved our debt position with new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provided
for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates. We closed the year with $2.9 billion in available
liquidity, which is up from $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019.

Through our efforts in these and other areas, we generated a robust $2 billion in cash from operations in
2020, which is up from $833 million in 2019. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion, an increase from $555
million in 2019. While we selectively scaled back our near-term plans for capital deployment in early April
of 2020 to conserve cash through COVID-19, we were very committed to several key priorities for cash,
which we believe serves to maximize shareholder value.

Our key priorities include the reinvestment in our businesses via capital expenditures, M&A, share
repurchases and the dividend. We have deployed $4.7 billion in capital across these areas over the last 4
years. In 2020, we reduced our original $300 million in CapEx plan by 50% and invested $154 million in
essential capital expenditures, which was down from $278 million in 2019. For 2021, we expect to resume
more normal levels of our reinvestments in our businesses and are planning for total capital expenditures
in the range of $275 million to $325 million for the year.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

We also pulled back on M&A activity in 2020, although strategic acquisitions remain an important
component of our long-term growth strategy. In 2020, we used $69 million in cash to acquire several
small businesses. And in 2021, we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement
our global automotive and industrial segments. As a reminder, we have not considered any of these future
acquisitions in our 2021 outlook.

The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928. Earlier this
week, our Board approved a $3.26 per share annual dividend for 2021, representing our 65th consecutive
annual increase in the dividend. This represents a 3% increase from the $3.16 per share paid in 2020. In
2020, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock prior to suspending our share repurchases
amid the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we were authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million
additional shares, and we expect to make additional opportunistic share repurchases again in 2021.

Turning to our outlook for 2021, we are reinstating our practice of providing full year guidance. In arriving
at our full year 2021 guidance, we considered several factors, including our past performance, current
growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends and the global economic outlook. In addition,
we consider the continued uncertainty of COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results.

With these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 4% to plus 6%. These
growth rates assume a relatively neutral impact from foreign currency translation, minimal price inflation
and as mentioned before, exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions. By business, we
are guiding to plus 4% to plus 6% total sales growth for the automotive segment, including plus 3% to
plus 5% comp sales growth. And a total sales increase of plus 3% to plus 5% for the industrial segment,
including an increase in comp sales of plus 2% to plus 4%.

On the earnings side, we currently expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.75.
This represents a 5% to 9% increase compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2020.

We move forward into 2021, confident in our strategic plans and initiatives to meet or exceed these
targeted results and deliver value. In addition, we believe that the underlying industry fundamentals for
our global automotive and industrial segments are favorable and will continue to provide us with sustained
long-term growth opportunities. So that's our financial update, and we look forward to reporting on further
improvement in our financial performance throughout 2021.

Thank you, and I'll now turn it back over to Paul.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Carol. Looking back on the quarter and the year, we are proud of our team for their continued
focus on executing our strategic growth initiatives and cost actions. The GPC team and our automotive and
industrial business proved resilient in meeting the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.

We closed the year strong with a strong financial performance. We want to thank each of our GPC team
members for their continued support, dedication and commitment to serving customers and being the
best. We entered 2021 as a stronger, more agile company, with streamlined operations and a more
optimized portfolio focused on the global automotive and industrial businesses. We are well positioned with
a stronger balance sheet and strategic plan to capture profitable growth, generate strong cash flow and
drive shareholder value.

We are off to a solid start to the year with global automotive sales growth and ongoing industrial recovery
and operational improvements. With the continued rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, we look forward to a
global recovery from the pandemic and a strengthening economy. For all these reasons, the GPC team is
excited about 2021 and we look forward to reporting on our progress as we move through the year. So

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

When you look at the NAPA U.S. trends, I guess, it wasn't quite clear on the commentary, it sounded as
if December ended flattish or December ended up? And I think could you talk a little bit about regional
performance as well as NAPA company-owned stores versus independents in the fourth quarter?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Happy to do so, Bret. And let me start with the company store versus our independents. Our
company stores slightly outperformed our independents in the quarter. We've seen that already reversed
in the other direction in January. That'll flip month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. So no real big news
there.

Regionality, what we saw in the quarter was kind of consistent with what we've been seeing. We saw really
good performance out West. I'm really proud of our Western division and the job that group is doing. Our
mountain team, as they have all year, had a solid quarter. And the mountain, Bret, just FYI, they stretch
from Colorado, Montana, all the way down to Texas. We saw some softness in the Southeast, we saw a
little softness in the Northeast as well.

In relation to your question about the cadence of the quarter and December specifically, we started out
the quarter okay. And I'm assuming that question was around U.S. automotive, Bret?

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Yes. Yes. That was U.S.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. October started out okay, pretty much in line with September. We saw softness in December,
and then we saw softness in December as well. I think the first couple of months were probably more
related to a little bit warmer weather than -- especially in November, plus we saw a little bit of a COVID
resurgence in the U.S.

December is a bit unique, Bret. And if you remember, we had a big December 1 year ago, 2019. We were
going up against some pretty tough comps. So that certainly impacted December as well. But look, here
is a good news, Bret, for us and the NAPA team is, we had a really strong rebound in January, both DIY
and DIFM, which we're really pleased to see the commercial business bouncing back in January. And that's
carrying into February as well.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay, great. And questions on the supply chain. It's sounded as if you were saying, maybe there's a
couple of categories where stock levels could be better. Is there anything to call out there? I mean, it
sounds like batteries have been a great category this winter. But maybe some supply constraints there? I
mean, are there any standout categories we should be looking at?

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Well, you hit the first one, Bret. We have had -- and we did have a good year in our battery business. And
I expect with this cold weather, we're going to see even in -- a greater surge in our battery business. But
supply has been a challenge. And I think you've heard that elsewhere.

Pleased to say, we're not seeing that in Europe. We have a strong battery business. We actually just
launched the NAPA battery across Europe. We have our suppliers taking good care of us over there. And
we're seeing really good business across Europe in the battery business.

But that would be the call out. There's a couple of other suppliers that are impacting us. And look, these
guys are battling labor shortages due to COVID, some shortages of raw materials. So I understand they
got their challenges, and we're hoping to see improvement here as we roll into '21.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

And I guess just a quick follow-up on Europe comment. It sounded as if you said both the U.S. and Europe
had sequentially softened a little bit from the third quarter. But could you talk a little bit how you saw
Europe roll through the fourth quarter and maybe there are trends into January?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. So Europe, they started out really strong. As you know, they had a great third quarter, mid double-
digit increase, Bret. We -- and we had a good October. They were up high single digits in October. We saw
a big reversal in November, a double-digit swing from October as Europe locked down due to COVID. So
we saw the third wave come through, and that just kind of knocked the wind out of our sales. December
bounced back a bit from that softer November. But again, good news, much like North America, we saw a
nice rebound in January, and our European team was up strong mid-single digit.

So we're encouraged. And we got a lot of good things going on with AAG. I would really, Bret, call out our
U.K. team. They had a really strong year despite some pretty severe lockdowns during the course of the
year. But again, I couldn't be more proud of our U.K. team.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First, a follow-up -- first of all, a follow-up question. So as you talked about the year-to-date in the U.S.,
you mentioned, do it for me, the Pro business getting better. Did that turn positive so far in January and
February?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Absolutely. Yes. We had a double-digit increase in January, and we saw it on both sides of the counter,
Chris. We saw it in DIY. As we did most of 2020, our DIY business was strong, like most in the industry.
But where we struggled a bit in '20 was in our commercial business. And our commercial business, I think,
is a bit unique compared to most. It's very, very heavy commercial fleet, government municipalities. But
again, really pleased to see that business turn positive in the month of January. And I'm hopeful, Chris,
with this some of the weather we're seeing and the reopening of the economies and the vaccines getting
out there that -- and along with a little bit of a lift in miles driven, we'll see some resurgence in our DIFM
business.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then following up there, as you think about the fleet business, how are you thinking about that?
Obviously, there's been some strain on colleges and governments and are you seeing any sequential

12

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

improvement in those businesses, presumably, they remain negative. And how are you thinking about the
outlook in '21?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Well, we do think we'll see improvement overall in that fleet business in '21. And January certainly is a
good indicator. Chris, look, there's a ways to go. We are -- by any stretch, we're not out of the woods in
relation to the upheaval caused by COVID, but we are seeing green shoots, and we are pleased to see a
real solid January.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. Understood. And then on the industrial business, if you're up 2% in January, that's not stimulus-
driven. And you're guiding, I think, 3% to 5% comps -- or 2% to 4% comps in that business in 2021,
and you did it down 8% in 2020. So is there something that you're seeing there that provides caution
why you wouldn't expect higher same-store sales in that segment? Or is that -- you're just trying to be
conservative given the unknown of COVID?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Well, look, Chris, there is a little -- certainly a bit of conservatism built into those numbers. We feel really
good about the prospects for a strong recovery in our industrial business in '21. We've seen now 8 straight
months of PMI. We generally trail that metric by a few months. So yes, we feel good. Especially when you
look back at 2020, Q2, we were down 17; Q3, down 9; and Q4, down 3 and then post a positive January.

But that conservatism that you kind of referred to, Chris, again, we're not out of the woods. We're
still seeing some plants shut down just in the last couple of weeks. We do a big business with the OE
automotive plants. We've seen a number of those shut down to raw material shortages. We're still
pressured in the southwest with oil and gas. So yes, we're -- we feel good, but we're also seeing still just
a few headwinds out there on the industrial side.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then last question is, Carol, can you talk about how you're thinking about gross margin rate in
2021 and as well as SG&A, given you did have a big COVID cost savings number that you're going to have
to lap against?

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes, happy to. As far as gross margin, and look, the team, we couldn't be more pleased with what
we've done in the gross margin area. We have -- and you saw we finally anniversaried the impact from
acquisitions and divestitures. So our core gross profit in Q4, really pleased to see our initiatives working.
We do expect, as we look ahead to have continued improvement in gross profit, may not be at the level
that it's been, but we would expect to see continued gross margin improvement. And we've called out the
initiatives in that area before from product mix and strategic category management and even our pricing
and global sourcing.

And then I'll make a few comments on SG&A and then maybe let Will add to talk about what we're going
to see for 2021. And you're right, we did have the temporary cost savings, but more importantly, our
permanent cost savings of $150 million do roll in to 2021. And we expect to -- while some of those,
certainly, the temporary savings come back in. When you look at our outlook for 2021 on SG&A, we have
improvement when you go back to, say, the 2019 levels. So we really have permanently reduced our cost
structure, if you will, but having said that, there's still things we're working on that we're going to see
headwinds in terms of payroll and freight. And I'll maybe let Will talk about a few things we're doing to
maybe offset some of those headwinds.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

William P. Stengel
President

Yes, Chris. So maybe just back on gross margin. I mean, gross margin is going to continue to be a focus
for us as we move forward. I think in the prepared remarks, we did a nice job of laying out kind of some
of the details in terms of what that means. But category management around pricing, global sourcing, et
cetera, will be important priorities for us as we move forward.

On the SG&A, there's really kind of 2 ways to think about it. First is the importance, as Carol alluded to,
of keeping these temporary cost savings out. So converting them from temporary to permanent, and
that's a daily activity that we work on with the teams here. But then obviously, very discrete productivity
initiatives around the globe around SG&A, ranging from labor productivity in DCs, evaluating and
analyzing indirect spend, low-cost country opportunities for back-office functions, et cetera. So we've got a
laundry list of very tactical actions, and we're excited about the momentum that we've got.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore.

Michael David Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Also, just wanted to offer congratulations to Will on the promotion.

William P. Stengel
President

Thank you, Mike.

Michael David Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So if I could start off -- just was on the SG&A front, first off. Is there a way to think about the potential
dollar growth year-over-year and/or the kind of organic comps that we would need to see to get natural
leverage there? Carol and Will, I think, historically, kind of 2% to 3% was the number, organic growth, but
if you could give us an update there?

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Look, we have -- and as you have seen, we are guiding to organic growth at -- in the 3% to 5%
range. We certainly expect to have margin improvement with that organic growth. And again, we're
looking at getting ourselves back to certainly to a sales level at where 2019 was but a profit and operating
margin level that's greater than that. So I think it's at the low end of the 3% that we can have margin
improvement. And I certainly think that you'll see that with some of the initiatives we talked about.

Michael David Montani
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. Great. And if I could, just on the NAPA front. Just wanted to parse out in the fourth quarter, if
there's any extra color you can share, Paul, on DIY versus DIFM comps? And then if you could help us just
to understand the traffic and ticket split for the comp.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Mike. I'll -- let me take the latter part of that question first. The -- as we look at ticket comps
and we look across the globe, I'm really pleased with the trends we're seeing in Australia. Our Asia Pac
business was up strong in both average ticket size and traffic. Canada, we were up both average ticket
size and traffic. U.S., our average ticket was up, which has been a trend we've seen for a number of
quarters now. Traffic was down a bit in the U.S., again, not a surprise because we saw a real surge in our

14

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

digital online, deliver to store, to -- pick up at curbside. So folks are still a little bit reticent, I think, to
walk into stores.

And then the other question, Mike, you asked was around DIY, DIFM in the quarter, in Q4. What we saw
was much like we had seen throughout the year with -- or the latter part of the year, I should say, with
DIY held up strong and DIFM was certainly pressured in the quarter. But again, as I think I mentioned
earlier in a question, really pleased to see both trending up in January. So we're cautiously optimistic that
we're going to see our DIFM return to solid growth in 2021.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.

Beth Reed Pricoli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

This is Beth Reed on for Scott. Just had a question on the acceleration in the U.S. auto business that
you're seeing into January and February. Is there any way to kind of quantify the impact of stimulus on
that acceleration? And any other factors you would call out that you think are the main drivers?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Thanks, Beth. Look, stimulus monies are definitely impacting the DIY business, I think, not only
for us, but our peer group. We -- but we are a dominant DIFM business. That's 80-plus percent of our
business that's -- so I don't really believe we see much impact, if any, stimulus on our DIFM business.

Yes. I think if I were to point to perhaps some of the lift that we're seeing early in the year. Look, the
weather is a factor. There's just no 2 ways about it. And we're seeing a return to a more normalized winter
that we haven't seen in a few years. What's unfortunate, Beth, and we don't want to take -- we don't want
to take this lightly. There are lots of folks out there in the Texas region that are without power. They've
been without power for a couple of days. So we don't mind seeing winter. I just wish it wasn't quite as
extreme and the impact that it's having.

We've got a number of distribution centers, branches, stores, that are closed throughout Texas, Oklahoma,
Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama. So it's definitely taken a toll here this week. We'll see the long-term
impact of a really cold weather, and it'll show up months down the road when parts begin to fail as a result
of some of this really brutally cold winter.

Beth Reed Pricoli
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

All right. Got it. And then just a quick clarification. Did you say January trends have largely kind of
continued into February?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Well, they certainly did. But what we're seeing right now is with the number of DC closures were across
Texas and the other states I just mentioned. Along with many of our industrial branches, I think the
number I saw yesterday, Beth, we had about 90 of our industrial branches were closed. So it's going to
have a little bit of an impact probably for a couple of days. But again, we'll recover, and I expect that will
have a positive impact longer-term on our business.

I'll pass my congrats on to Will.

William P. Stengel
President

Thanks, Dan.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Carol, I wanted to start -- apologies if I missed this, but trying to screw away the cost-cutting last year
with maybe some of the organic growth slowing. You targeted $100 million. Obviously, you exceeded
that meaningfully. I think you said $150 in permanent cost cuts. As you look back with hindsight, is it
possible, in some places, you may have cut too deep and that's part of the reason for the organic growth
slowdown? And then if not, can you maybe share some detail on where you did remove the cost, so we
can better understand why that isn't impacting service levels?

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Look, we -- as you look at our cost savings, and again, this was done early on in response to the very
drastic declines in volume that we saw from Europe starting at the end of Q1 to North America and other
geographies, we had -- Q2 was one of our worst quarters ever in the company's history. And with that,
there was actions that needed to be taken and it is related to reducing payroll, reducing positions. We had
furloughs, we had deferred travel and entertainment. We looked at facility and lease reductions. We looked
at our facility costs. We looked at -- I mean we looked at anything and everything. And it was -- again, we
did that without impacting our service, but we did it to adjust to the lower volumes.

And then as volumes have come back, we looked at those costs. Again, some of those costs had to come
back in. During this time, we also didn't let up on our investments in productivity and automation. So we
had a number of automation projects that we continue to work on that would help us with productivity
improvements, where we rationalize facilities and put in more automated conveyor systems. That helped
us as well.

So again, we -- the permanent savings go back to a year ago. Those were largely payroll-related, the
$150 million. Again, we were very comfortable to how those were done. The temporary ones were just
that. They were temporary in nature. And remember, part of that temporary was government subsidies.
So again, we had about $60 million in government subsidies that are nonrecurring. The fact of the matter
is we go into 2021 with a lower overall cost base and excitement about the initiatives we have in place to
keep our cost structure down.

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Daniel, I'll just add a comment to that as well because it's been mentioned before, and I touched on it in
my prepared remarks. But just to call out, in our NAPA business here across the U.S., we have over 3,000
sales professionals between our company stores and our independent stores that are working with our
shops and professional garages every day. So the thought of, did we cut too deep? We don't believe so.
And again, I think what we saw were some transitory challenges in '20 that are going to bounce back in
'21.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask a clarifier on the comp growth you said earlier, Carol.
I think you said within auto, 3% to 5% comps with 4 to 6 total revs, and then industrial is 2 to 4, with
total revs in 3 to 5. Most of those would imply roughly only 100 basis points of FX headwind. I guess can
you help me understand in how they have a similar amount of headwinds between the segments when
automotive has a much larger European footprint? So I would think FX is more of a tailwind to the auto
business. So trying to reconcile, yes, the magnitude of FX impact.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Just to be clear, the same-store sales guidance that we gave in relation to the total sales is more of
the impact of the carryover of acquisitions from 2020. So we had a number of bolt-on acquisitions in the
automotive space and then we also had 3 industrial acquisitions late in 2020. So the 1% differential is the
carryover of M&A. Our implication for foreign currency is really neutral. And we also have inflation neutral
in these numbers. As Paul mentioned, we expect we will see some inflation at some point. But this is truly
just what we know today as far as organic growth, plus a little bit of carryover from acquisitions that's in
that guidance.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of David Bellinger with Wolfe Research.

David Leonard Bellinger
Wolfe Research, LLC

I want to follow-up on January, but in a bit of a different context. So a few of your auto parts competitors
have indicated comparable sales accelerating into the double digits into January. It seems as though NAPA
comp sales are up high single digits at this point. So is there anything that's changed versus your peers
from the last few quarters? Is there something strategic on your part that tells them to narrow the gap
versus competitors? Or is it really the mix of business that's driving that better delta now?

Paul D. Donahue
Chairman & CEO

Well, look, David, it's a reasonable question. We've been working on a number of initiatives throughout
the course of 2020 that I would tell you, I think, are really beginning to take hold. We are not nearly as
weighted towards the DIY side. So even though we're seeing some nice lift in DIY, it's not going to move
the needle for us like DIFM.

So what I would point to and how we're narrowing that gap is the slight recovery we're seeing from
COVID, markets opening back up, I think we're going to see miles driven tick back up. We haven't seen
any official numbers out of December, January yet. But that, coupled with some winter weather is all going
to help spike our DIFM business. And again, we're really, really pleased to see that spike in the month of
January.

David Leonard Bellinger
Wolfe Research, LLC

Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up here, how are you thinking about the pace of parts inflation
throughout 2021? You mentioned a limited benefit last year, maybe a low single-digit rate coming this
year. Are you getting ahead of that now and flowing some price to both DIY and commercial given
strengthening demand? And do you expect to fully offset any cost increases through price this year?

Carol B. Yancey
Executive VP, CFO & Chief Accounting Officer

Yes. Look, the -- we are getting early indication from our suppliers. I mean, look, our suppliers, as
Paul mentioned, they're facing raw material increases, freight and ocean cargo and just the significant
increases that our suppliers are facing, labor shortages, labor inflation. We are hearing that our suppliers
are discussing price increases. We believe, certainly in automotive, it's been very rational. And as these
price increases come, that they will get passed through.

Also on the industrial side, our teams are trying to stay ahead of that and doing a lot of things to make
sure that those can -- when they do get the pricing, they can pass them along. I would tell you that will
probably be more second half weighted. Again, some of this is managing through the uncertainty right
now, but probably more second half weighted. So the 1% to 2%, 1% to 3%, if you will, is on a full year
basis, but probably more second half. But again, that's not in any of our numbers.

GENUINE PARTS COMPANY FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 17, 2021

And the last thing I would just add, and you heard Will talk about it, our teams have so many terrific
initiatives going on in the gross margin area, especially in terms of pricing. So we're a lot more agile
today. We have a lot more analytics and a lot more strategic pricing initiatives that will help us offset this
as well.
