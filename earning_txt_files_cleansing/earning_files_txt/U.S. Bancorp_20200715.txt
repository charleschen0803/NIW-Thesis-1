Presentation

Operator

Welcome to the U.S. Bancorp's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the
results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and
Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This
call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 12:00 p.m. Eastern through
Wednesday, July 22, at 12 midnight Eastern.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations and
Economic Analysis for U.S. Bancorp.

Jennifer Ann Thompson
Executive VP and Director of Investor Relations & Economic Analysis

Thank you, Mitas, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President
and CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us on the call today are our Chief Risk
Officer, Jodi Richard; and our Chief Credit Officer, Mark Runkel.

During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide
presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our
website at usbank.com.

I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to
risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are
described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent
reports on file with the SEC.

I'll now turn the call over to Andy.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks,
Terry, Jodi, Mark and I will take any questions you have.

I'll begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.41. Consistent with the
industry, our performance is being impacted by the current economic environment. Loan growth reflected
the impact of defensive draws by corporations in March and early April, strong mortgage loan growth,
and the impact of the Paycheck Protection Program, which supported small businesses impacted by the
COVID-19 situation. Increased liquidity in the financial system and a flight to quality drove strong deposit
growth in the quarter.

Our healthy fee income growth this quarter is a testament to our diversified business model. Some fee
lines, including our payments businesses, were negatively impacted by slower economic activity. However,
we saw very strong growth in our mortgage and commercial products businesses. And while consumer
spend activity remains pressured compared with a year ago, volume trends in each of our payments
businesses have improved as some economies have started to reopen. Expenses were held relatively flat
compared with the first quarter. We continue to manage our cost structure prudently and in line with a
slower revenue growth environment.

Credit quality metrics in the second quarter reflected increased economic stress, offset by the beneficial
impact of governance stimulus and forbearance and deferral programs. During the quarter, we increased
our allowance for loan losses in response to economic conditions. We believe our reserve level at June 30
is appropriate based on the information we have available. Changes in the allowance will be dependent on
actual credit performance and changes in economic conditions.

U.S. BANCORP FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2020

In the lower right quadrant of this slide, you can see that book value per share grew 2.8% compared with
a year ago, and we remain well capitalized.

Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. We delivered a 7.1% return on tangible common equity in the
second quarter, impacted by lower earnings according to the current economic environment.

Slide 5 shows our continually improving digital uptake trends. Shelter-in-place orders early in the quarter
and temporary branch closures due to the COVID-19 have increased and increased in digital adoptions.
Digital now accounts for more than 3/4 of all service transactions and about 46% of all loan sales. We
expect digital adoption by customers to stick even after the economy fully reopens.

Now let me turn it over to Terry who will provide more color on the quarter.

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 6, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of
second quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 6.9% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 10.0%
year-over-year. Growth includes $7.3 billion of loans made under the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program
during the second quarter. The average loan size to these small businesses was approximately $73,000.
Excluding the impact of PPP, average loans grew 5.4% on a linked-quarter basis and 8.5% year-over-year.
Excluding PPP, linked quarter growth was primarily driven by growth in commercial loans and in mortgage
loans.

In late first quarter, business customers drew down their lines to support business activity and future
liquidity requirements. We started to see paydowns of commercial loans in May and the paydown activity
accelerated in June as many customers access the capital markets. As of last week, about 2/3 of the
defensive draws, we saw in the late first quarter and early second quarter, have been repaid. Strong
residential mortgage growth reflected the low interest rate environment. Credit card balances declined in
the quarter due to lower spend activity.

Turning to Slide 7. Average deposits increased 11.2% on a linked-quarter basis and grew 16.8% year-
over-year. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased 30.1% year-over-year, driven by corporate and
commercial banking, consumer and business banking and wealth management and investment services.

Turning to Slide 8. While the net charge-off ratio was relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis,
nonperforming assets increased 24% sequentially, reflecting increased economic stress. The
nonperforming assets to loans plus other real estate owned ratio totaled 0.38% at June 30 compared with
0.30% at March 31. We have taken a proactive approach in evaluating credit quality across the entire
commercial loan portfolio and considered risk rating changes in the evaluation of our allowance for credit
losses.

Our loan loss provision was $1.7 billion in the second quarter, inclusive of $437 million of net charge-offs
and a reserve build of $1.3 billion. The increase in the reserve was related to changes in risk ratings and
deterioration in economic conditions, driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and global economies
and our expectation that credit losses and nonperforming assets will increase from current levels.

The increase in the allowance for credit loss is considered our best estimate of the impact of slower
economic growth and elevated unemployment, partially offset by the benefits of government's stimulus
programs as of June 30. While estimates are based on many quantitative factors and qualitative
judgments, our base case outlook assumes an unemployment rate of 13% to 14% for the second quarter,
declining to 9.0% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and to 7.8% by the fourth quarter of 2021.

Slide 9 highlights our key underwriting metrics and exposures to certain at-risk segments given the
current environment. We have a strong relationship-based credit culture at U.S. Bank, supported by cash-
flow-based lending that considers sensitivity to stress, proactive management and portfolio diversification,
which allows us to support growth throughout the economic cycle and produces consistent results.

U.S. BANCORP FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2020

Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the second quarter of 2020, we reported $0.41 per share.
These results were adversely affected by the current economic environment and the related impact to
consumer and business spend and the expected increases in credit losses.

Turning to Slide 11. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion was essentially
flat compared with the first quarter, in line with our expectations, as the impact of lower interest rates was
partially offset by deposit and funding mix and loan growth. Also, as expected, the net interest margin
declined by 29 basis points compared with the first quarter. The lower margin reflected lower rates and
a flatter yield curve as well as higher cash balance of being maintained for liquidity to accommodate
customer demand. While loan mix put pressure on the net interest margin, the earning asset impact was
mostly offset by beneficial shifts in deposit and funding mix.

Slide 12 highlights trends in noninterest income. Strength in mortgage banking and commercial product
revenue more than offset declines in the payment revenues. Mortgage banking revenue benefited from
higher mortgage production and stronger gain-on-sale margins partially offset by the net impact of change
in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Commercial product revenue
reflected higher corporate bond issuance fees and trading revenue.

Slide 13 provides information about our payment services businesses, including exposures to impacted
industries. Payments revenues was pressured by the impact of COVID-related shutdowns and reduced
economic activity in the quarter. However, consumer sales trends improved throughout the quarter and
that trajectory has continued in early July. Credit and debit card revenue declined 22.2% year-over-year
and merchant processes services revenue declined 34.2% year-over-year. Both categories performing
somewhat better than what we had expected. Corporate payment products revenue declined 39.5% year-
over-year, in line with our expectations as business spending continues to reflect cautious sentiment.

Slide 14 -- turning to Slide 14. Noninterest expense was essentially flat on a linked-quarter basis, in
line with our expectations. Second quarter expense reflected an increase in revenue related costs from
mortgage and capital markets production and expense related to COVID-19 situation. During the quarter,
we incurred incremental COVID-19 related costs of approximately $66 million. These expenses consisted
of about $13 million related to increasing liabilities for potential future delivery claims related to the
airline industry and other merchants and about $50 million related to premium pay for frontline workers
and costs tied to providing a safe-working environment for our employees. We expect these incremental
COVID expenses to begin to dissipate in the second half of the year.

Slide 15 highlights our capital position. At June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, calculated in
accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the current expected credit loss
methodology implementation, was 9.0% at June 30. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio reflecting the
full implementation of the current expected credit loss accounting methodology was 8.7%.

I'll now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the third quarter of 2020, we expect fully taxable
equivalent net interest income to be relatively flat compared to the second quarter. We expect mortgage
revenue to continue to be strong on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, but it is likely to decline
compared with the second quarter, reflecting slower refinancing activity for the industry. Payments
revenue is likely to be adversely affected through the remainder of the year on a year-over-year
basis, due to reduced consumer and business spending activity. However, we expect continued gradual
improvement in sales volumes. We expect noninterest expenses to be relatively stable compared to the
second quarter. Future levels of reserve build will depend on a number of factors, including changes in
the outlook for credit quality, reflecting both economic conditions and portfolio performance and any
beneficial offset from government stimulus. We will continue to assess the allowance -- the adequacy of
the allowance for credit losses as credit conditions change. For the full year 2020, we expect our taxable
equivalent tax rate to be approximately 15%.

I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.

U.S. BANCORP FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2020

Thanks, Terry. I'll end my remarks on Slide 16, which highlights a few of the recent actions we've taken as
a company to help support our customers, communities and employees.

We are operating in uncertain times, not only for the economy but for our society in general. However,
I am confident that together we can make lasting and impactful changes that will leave us all better on
the other side of these trying times. We are well positioned for near-term challenges, and we continue to
manage this company with a long-term lens, and focus on maximizing shareholder value. Our capital and
liquidity positions are strong, and our unique business model remains a differentiator for us.

I would highlight 3 things that we will continue to support our ability to deliver industry-leading returns
through the cycle. First, as our second quarter results indicate, our diversified business mix reduces
revenue and earnings volatility. And this quarter, it allowed us to deliver good revenue growth even
against a challenging interest rate backdrop and an industry-wide slowdown in consumer spending activity.
Second, our time-tested credit underwriting discipline puts us in a strong position to navigate through an
economic downturn offsetting this up to return to prudent and consistent growth in the more favorable
economic environment. And third, our culture remains the foundation, which informs not only what we do
at U.S. Bank but how we do it. I couldn't be more proud of our employees have come together to support
our customers and communities, and they face significant economic and social disruption. I want to take
this opportunity to thank them for all their hard work and resiliency.
We will now open up the call for Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Let's say, I guess, Terry, a question for you just on -- you gave the NII expectations for the third quarter.
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the sort of the puts and takes, meaning balance sheet growth.
And where you'd see the margin trajecting from here?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. From a loan perspective, again, we would expect that we'll see year-over-year growth. But on a
linked-quarter basis, clearly, it's going to be down. We're going to continue to see paydowns associated
with those defensive draws that we had at the end of the first quarter and early second quarter. So that
will put downward pressure on a linked-quarter basis.

PPP will actually probably help from a growth standpoint as we think about the second quarter, but it does
start to dissipate in third and fourth quarter simply because of the loan forgiveness program. So...

On the consumer side, auto lending has generally been a little bit -- it was weak in April and May, and --
but it's gotten stronger in June. So we believe that's going to be a bright spot as we think about the third
quarter. But overall, consumer lending is likely to be down simply because consumer spending has been
down. So that's kind of the puts and takes if you think about loan growth.

Margin, we believe, is going to be relatively stable. It will be helped a little bit by PPP, but impacted a little
bit. There will be a little bit of pressure on the yield curve side of the equation but relatively stable to the
second quarter.

Robert Scott Siefers
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. Perfect. And then just given the absolute level of interest rates, do fee waivers start to become an
issue for -- in the money market area. And if I recall correctly from the last time rates were this, I think
those show up in trust fees. If they are sort of something you guys are thinking about, where would they
show up? And what's kind of the impact you guys would see?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. I think the impact would be probably similar to what we saw last time, given -- but it will maybe a
little bit more simply because of growth. But it will show up in trust and investment management fees
because that's where our money market fund revenue gets recognized.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just to clarify on the net interest income outlook of stable quarter-to-quarter. Does that include some of
the kind of benefit from PPP repaying or forbearing? And just what are your assumptions on that in terms
of the next couple of quarters?

U.S. BANCORP FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2020

Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So it includes all of the puts and takes. Like I said, it will reflect a decline on a linked-quarter basis in
terms of commercial loans because of the draws, but there will be some benefit associated with PPP. So it
includes essentially all the puts and takes associated with net interest income.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then I am wondering on the PPP, it seems like your kind of approach was more granular or
to go after kind of smaller, really, the small, small businesses if I just look at your total amount funded
versus applications. And just wondering if you could talk to that approach and maybe give us some insight
in terms of the cost that you've incurred to originate those loans?

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

Matt, this is Andy. We took the applications as they came in, serving our customers initially and then
ultimately outside of the bank. As you saw, we had over 101,000 applications, and the average balance
was in the $70,000. So a lot of our customers are small business, and we helped a lot of employees, so
the team did a great job. We started with a bit of a manual process and went to a much more automated
process, certainly in the second round. So it was just based on the request that came in and the priority
was really time based.

Matthew Derek O'Connor
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay. And then just the cost to originate, was it just kind of moving resources from one part of the bank
to another or...?

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Yes, it was, Matt. We actually had individuals from -- throughout the entire company, help us through
this process, particularly the manual process that started and the technology as well. But yes, the entire
bank was supportive.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I wanted to drill down a little bit on your comments, Terry, on the payments business and sort of a gradual
improvement there. I guess, first of all, could you just give us a little bit of a sense for the -- how much
the consumer recovered? And they seemed, like, in June, the year-on-year declines in acquiring volumes
and in card volumes is really, really lessened. But can you just give us a sense of what, say, the exit
rates were in terms of volumes in those categories in June versus March? And I guess, as an adjunct to
that, why wouldn't that suggest that, at least sequentially, you should see pretty sharp improvements in
terms of the sequential growth in issuing and acquiring revenue versus release versus the second quarter.
Obviously, year-on-year is tough, but versus the second quarter, it would seem to suggest that you could
see a nice improvement sequentially. And I just want to get your sense as to whether I'm thinking about
that right?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Saul, I think you're right on. I think when we end up looking at our payments business on a
sequential basis, we will see growth. Particularly in the credit card and the merchant, the corporate
payments, we would also expect growth, but maybe not at the same level, simply because sales volumes

U.S. BANCORP FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2020

there -- our commercial spend -- our commercial customers are still fairly cautious. But to kind of give
you some perspective, at the end of -- or in April, we saw on the merchant side of the equation, consumer
spend was down almost between 50%, 55% kind of in that ballpark. And today, it's really back to spend
levels that are closer to about 20%. So that has come back really very nicely. The things that are going,
it's going to continue to impact for a while is the mix associated with the airline industry and some of the
entertainment, but it has come back very nice, and to your point on sequential growth, is right on.

With respect to credit card, credit card, we had said, was down kind of in that 30% range in April, and that
has come back nicely as well. In terms of credit card, it is still down. It's down around 10% to 12%. We
would expect that trajectory to continue so into the third quarter. Debit card revenue -- or sales, excuse
me, actually had been pretty strong. And the sales on the debit card side has been kind of up 10% to 12%
kind of in that range. And while we wouldn't expect it to be maybe quite at that higher level in the third
quarter, it's still, I think, going to be relatively strong.

And then on the CPS side of the equation, CPS, again, the commercial spend has been pretty cautious.
It was down kind of in the magnitude of 30% to 35% in that April sort of time frame. And it's still down
around somewhere between 25% and 30%. We do expect it to get a little better than that in the third
quarter for a couple of reasons, simply because government spend tends to be strongest in the third
quarter. So hopefully, that gives you some insights or perspective.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. No, that's super helpful. If I could squeeze another one in on fees. The deposit service charge is
obviously down a lot, and you commented about fee waivers related to customer, related to COVID. I
mean how do we think about that going forward? And I don't know if you can quantify that? Or how do
we -- or just give us a sense of how that, I think, $133 million, how that could compare to maybe a more
normalized level in the coming quarters?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Similar sort of impacts as consumer spend and just activity has declined. And then you have the
stimulus checks and all sorts of here facing, just incidence levels related to NSF and fee waivers in terms
of helping our customers has impacted the second quarter. On a sequential basis, we would expect that
will come back nicely in the third quarter. But on a year-over-year basis, it's still going to be down simply
because consumer activity is down, similar to merchant or credit card.

Saul Martinez
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

So it will take some time to get back. So it's sort of a more normalized or was more normalized...

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, that's right.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.

Erika Najarian
BofA Securities, Research Division

My first question is on the reserve. And this is a question that all your peers have been getting during
this earnings season. So I always like to think in a CECL world that your reserve to loan ratio of 2.5%,
4% represents a cumulative loss rate for the recession that represents, let's say, let's say, 2 years. And
I guess the question here is that, is that your view? I guess, it's another way of asking, are you done in
terms of reserve building? And related to that, your peers have also talked about the base case, but that

Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

U.S. BANCORP FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2020

the base case tends to be one of, let's say, 5-or-so different scenarios and those scenarios are weighted.
And so I'm wondering if you could give us some insight in terms of, as you had built your reserve, how
much weight that base case was taken into account versus perhaps other scenario?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So let me take the first question. And when we think about the reserving, you're absolutely right.
You make your estimates at the end of any particular quarter based upon the information that you
have available at that particular point in time. And certainly at June 30, we believe that the reserve
is appropriate for the cumulative losses that are there. So we wouldn't expect future increases in the
reserve. But again, that is going to be highly dependent upon what changes, either in terms of economic
factors or if our credit quality changes differently than what we had expected. So the important thing is
that we're going to continue to assess the reserve every quarter based upon the information that we have
available to us. But you are right. Theoretically, that is how CECL works, and that's how we're trying to
apply it.

Coming to your second question, the information that I ended up giving to you with respect to
unemployment, now keep in mind, unemployment is an important factor, but there's like 200 different
multiples that are a part of the modeling process. So it's pretty complex because you've got a lot of
different types of portfolios, et cetera. But unemployment, the information I gave you was really the
weighted average across many different multiple scenarios that we ended up looking at.

So you are right. When we look at this, we look at information from many sources in terms of things like
unemployment, GDP, et cetera, et cetera. We develop a base case, if you will, but then we look at multiple
scenarios around that base case and weighed it. But the information that I gave you was weighted based
upon those multiples. So it should give you some comparability when you think about that. Andy, have you
anything to add?

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

No, you've said it well.

Erika Najarian
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And my follow-up question is to Andy. So Andy, I think, what was particularly impressive about this
quarter is your PPNR resiliency. And obviously, the forward look would imply that this will continue. And
Terry just told us that we could be done in terms of reserve building. As we think about the future and as
we think about a more difficult operating environment for banks, how are you thinking about inorganic
growth strategies from here?

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Erika, first, as you mentioned, I think our diversified revenue mix helps a lot. And this is -- this
quarter probably represented it very well. We had some pressure on payments because of the spend
activity that Terry talked about. But mortgage and commercial products had a -- it hit it out of the park
this quarter in terms of positive. So -- and then the other part of our diversification is how much of our
revenue comes from the balance sheet or net interest income as well as fee revenue. It's sort of a mix
back 50-50 there. So that really helps in environments like this, and different businesses do well in
different economic cycles.

As we think about the future, I think, we are planning for a future that has continued dull rates. It will
take a while for spend to get back to normal. So we're going to manage our expenses in that -- with that
thought in mind, which is what we're doing today. And we're going to continue to invest in the businesses
that have opportunity as well as the digital initiatives that I talked about. And those digital initiatives will

offer not only the opportunity for our customers to connect with us in a virtual means, I think it will also
offer expense opportunities in the long run. So those are the ways we're thinking about it.

Erika Najarian
BofA Securities, Research Division

And just any thoughts on inorganic strategies, acquisitions, anything to say more bluntly?

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Thanks for being blunt. So we will look at opportunities that come up. The only thing I'd say is, in this
environment, Erika, there's a lot of uncertainty. And it's certainly not a clear vision in terms of the future,
even for us. So to look at someone else with that lens will be challenging. But I do think opportunities will
come up because of the stresses that are out there, and we'll take a look.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just I want to challenge your -- look, you're one of the most conservative banks, but I want to challenge
some of your conservatism. So on your base case, again, 9% unemployment by the end of this year, I
know it's a lot of scenarios, and it's weighted average and all that. But at least one of your peers was
more conservative than that. And I know that's the Fed base case, so there's nothing crazy about it. It's
just -- I thought why not be more conservative if you have the flexibility or when you take the weighted
average of the different scenarios -- I'm pushing back a little bit more, like this seems like peak reserve
builds, and you said that, but if your economic assumptions are wrong, then that won't be the case, so
why not be more conservative there?

And along those lines, your payments comment that it should improve sequentially kind of makes sense,
but look, we just had a big increase in COVID cases, which leads to more deaths, which leads to some
closing down, and how are you feeling about that progression?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So maybe to address the first question. When you end up establishing the reserve, you have to
establish what you believe is appropriate based upon the information that you have available to us.
And while we use things like Moody's Analytics and other sources in order to kind of come up with that
projection of what unemployment, as an example, looks like, so you have to make sure that your reserve
is appropriate based upon the information that you have. You can't build in tons of conservatism, so to
speak, into it.

But again, part of it is, we'll have to kind of wait and see on the payments side of the equation in terms
of COVID cases. Based upon our estimates right now, I think that this go around versus last go around,
I think that states are continuing to try to stay open to the best that they can. I think you have different
sort of health treatments and all sorts of different things that exist based upon better information or
different information than what existed before. But quite honestly, it's -- we're going to find out. There's a
lot of uncertainty, and it's too early to know.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. And I'd add on. Mike, I think you're right. Things are changing every day and the facts change daily,
weekly, sometimes hourly. So we're just going to continue to assess and manage the company, given the
changes that are out there. What Terry is sounding, what are you seeing right now, and as he said, we get
data every day, and we're going to continue to assess what we think is going to happen. We're running

a lot of models. We're sharing with our Board a lot of scenarios, including a much harsher scenario and
understanding what would occur in that. So -- but you're right. I mean there's a lot of unknown yet, and
we are being conservative in the way we're approaching our financial modeling.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And then one follow-up question. Look, your third slide of substance, it's Slide #5, but the digital
engagement trends, I mean you're certainly putting that front and center. Can you bring us up to date,
like, as of like to the moment, of what's happening with your digital engagement? And what does that
mean in terms of branches and national expansion and anything else? Because if you're putting this as
your third slide in your earnings deck, it's clearly -- I know it's always been important, but it seems like
it's now being put on steroids in terms of the way you're highlighting this, which must mean some bigger
part of the strategy.

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

So Mike, it has always been important, but I do think the recent events and the customer behavior
changes has even accelerated that further. And you can see that in the numbers, nearly 80% of
transactions now occurring in a digital fashion. The branch activity as far as transactions is down a lot. On
the sales side, I talked about the loan sales. But actually, total sales in the branches have doubled since
-- excuse me, on a digital platform have doubled versus a year ago. And so we do expect those digital
investments, both do-it-yourself and do-it-together, in other words, co-browsing or virtual activity is going
to continue to be important, not just for the consumer but across many business lines. So that investment
that we're making is important on 2 fronts. It's important to make sure we're giving the customer the best
experience and connecting with them in the ways they choose to, and it's also offering efficiencies in the
long run. As we talked about, we do -- we were -- we announced over a year ago that we expect to have
10% to 15% fewer branches. And I would expect that number to increase in terms of the number of fewer
branches that we have because of this change in customer behavior. Branches will still be important, but
the number of them and the size of them will be fewer and less.

Michael Lawrence Mayo
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Any number on those branches, the updated number?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

We don't have a number on it yet. We continue to assess. And as we think about the changes that are
occurring and the closures that are out there, we'll continue to assess what we expect, but I do expect it
to be higher than the 10% to 15%.

Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James.

David Joseph Long
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Going back to the Paycheck Protection Program, we talked a little bit about the expectations for
forgiveness there. But do you have a time line on where you think your $7-plus billion in PPP loans may
start to be forgiven?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Well, we do expect that there's going to be some forgiveness that's going to take place as early as
the third quarter. So there's going to be some runoff of the balances just because of that. I think the vast

majority of it happens late third, fourth and early first quarter in terms of timing. That's our expectation
right now.

David Joseph Long
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then on the deposit side, obviously, very good deposit growth there. How do you see the
trajectory of that playing out, taking into consideration the PPP and all liquidity that are -- that's built in
now? And how does that impact the size of the balance sheet through the rest of the year?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Well, our expectation is that deposit growth is going to continue to be strong, at least through the
end of the year, if not into early next year. And it's really highly correlated to the amount of liquidity that
the Fed is continuing to pump into the system. The impacts from a balance sheet perspective, as you
know, I think, you certainly have a funding benefit associated with that. The challenge is always trying to
identify if you get the loan growth grade; if you don't, you're going to have to look for opportunities on
the investment side of the equation. So -- but we do expect strong growth in deposits into the foreseeable
future because of the Fed programs.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just one question on the expense side. Obviously, much stronger-than-expected revenues, especially
out of mortgage, but noting that you're talking about some of the COVID costs coming off and that even
some of the, like, costs -- I would think incentive-related cost type of stuff like mortgage will be softer
sequentially. You're still talking about flattish expenses sequentially. And can you -- I was wondering
if maybe you can kind of put that in context with some of the broader-reaching comments you just
made about the future of the expense base in terms of why you don't only expect to see flat expenses
sequentially?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. The areas that we're going to see growth or not -- I mean on a sequential basis, I do think you're
going to see revenue related sort of expenses coming down a bit. You will see COVID-related expenses
coming down. There's still going to be a fairly significant amount of PPP and costs associated with all sorts
of things that will end up happening in the third quarter. The other thing that I think that ends up coming
into play is just timing with respect to, for example, other loan expenses and when they end up getting
recognized relative to the mortgage production that occurred. So we recognize revenue in the quarter in
which the application is taken unlocked, but a lot of the expenses end up happening in a quarter that's
following that, simply because of the timing of closing loans and that sort of thing. So that's a big driver
that ends up impacting the sequential growth from second to third quarter that you have to keep in mind.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And a follow-up on the money market fee waivers. You had mentioned earlier that you would expect
them to be larger than last time. Can you put that into a numeric context for us? How much were you
waiving either on an annual basis or a peak through the last cycle? And how is the asset management
complex different in terms of mix today versus then?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

U.S. BANCORP FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2020

Yes. In terms of the mix of the product that we end up offering, I think, there's probably a more
government or govi-based sort of money market as opposed to prime based. The prime base declined
fairly significantly. But the overall -- when you end up looking at assets under management, it's certainly
we're at a higher level today than 10 years ago. That's the reason. I think that the rate of the fee waivers
will be pretty similar, but just the assets under management and the wealth management space is higher.
And I'm trying to put my fingers on kind of what that looks like right now, but we certainly can kind of get
back to you, Ken.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. I'll follow up.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

Terry, I think, fee waivers will -- when they are implemented will be somewhere in that $30 million a
quarter range, plus or minus.

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.

Vivek Juneja
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

A couple of ones. Firstly, on credit cards, can you give us the reserves to cards? And also, what are you
seeing in terms of hard customers where deferrals are coming off? Have you started to see deferrals come
off? And what's the reaction been in terms of customers paying the full amount or asking to extend the
deferrals?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Vivek. I'm going to ask Mark Runkel, our Chief Credit Officer, to respond to that. Mark?

Mark G. Runkel
Senior Executive VP & Chief Transformation Officer

The reserve ratio on the credit card was 10.14% at the end of June, that's question number one. The
second in terms of those customers that have come off some of the programs that we've got in place,
we've seen very strong payment performance to date. About 70% of those customers have started to
make normal payments after those periods of time. We've seen a few of those, about 20% re-enroll and
then the rest has moved into delinquency. So -- so far, so good on customer performance.

Vivek Juneja
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. That's great. Terry, if I may just sneak in one for you. Other income, I know it had a lot of noise this
quarter, what would you suggest as a run rate for us to use?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So if you kind of think about the -- when I end up looking at the current run rate, just given the
environment that we're in -- I would end up looking at second quarter as a pretty good estimate of what
future quarters are going to look like, at least for a while.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Andy, we've seen some real crosscurrents in economic information, for example, the Empire State
Manufacturing Index Canal today positive first time since February, and industrial production coming in a
little better today as well. But on the other hand, the initial unemployment claims numbers remain very
elevated. What are your customers, when you talk to your customers, and I understand the restaurants
and the leisure guys are still feeling a lot of pain, but can you give us some color on what are your
commercial customers telling you? What are they seeing?

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. So first, you're absolutely right, there are some mixed signals. And I think the mixed signals is the
sort of the competing factors of the stress in the economy from the shutdown, offset by the stimulus that's
occurring across many categories, unemployment benefits, the stimulus checks, PPP, all those things. And
those are competing forces, which makes modeling and projecting very difficult in this environment. I
would say small businesses are struggling the most, for a lot of different reasons, principally because they
have less cushion than the larger companies. The larger companies, as Terry mentioned, initially, they
were very defensive, drawing down in excess of $22 billion, but about 2/3 of that is paid back. So while
certain industries continue to be stressed, you're seeing other industries that are actually doing a little bit
better in this environment. So small, challenged; middle and large, mixed. Some doing well and some not
so much. Terry, what would you add or remark?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

No, I think that's what, I mean, I think is right.

Gerard Sean Cassidy
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And then as a follow-up, in the reserving -- in the provisioning you guys did this quarter, I know you
mentioned there's a lot of moving parts, as you just touched on it, Andy. But how much would you say
of the provisioning was allocated to specific credits that you're now starting to see obviously distressed
versus just building up the general reserves?

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean I'll have Mark kind of add to this. But certainly, when we end up looking at net charge-offs
and things like that, there hasn't been a lot of movement, especially on the consumer side of the equation.
You are starting to see nonperforming assets on commercial starting to grow, as we talked about, but
it's still, what I would say, relatively early. I think the government stimulus programs and things like that
have, kind of, at least, for some period of time, muted; some of those underlying credit characteristics
that you typically see. So more of it or most of it is really driven based upon kind of our outlook when we
think about the economic conditions going forward.

And then at the end, looking at it, it's kind of a split between products, it's probably more heavily
weighted, 60-plus percent of the reserve build really is more focused on wholesale and commercial real
estate as opposed to consumer at this particular point in time. Mark, what would you add?

Mark G. Runkel
Senior Executive VP & Chief Transformation Officer

The only other thing I might add is, as you mentioned this in the early comments, we've gone through the
portfolio very granular and downgraded the credits appropriately. So we feel like all of that's been factored
into the analysis and the allowance. But the bulk of the change is really the economic assumptions as
Terry noted.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & CEO

Ken, coming back to your question on fee waivers, the impact, second to third quarter, so on a sequential
basis of fee waivers, will be about $30 million net ballpark.

Operator

And your final question comes from the line of David Smith with Autonomous.

David Smith
Autonomous Research US LP

Just to clarify on the expense guidance. 3Q stable to 2Q relatively. Does that include the COVID expenses
in 2Q?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. That's -- it's total expenses. It's all inclusive. And again, we'll see benefit of COVID coming down, but
some of those production-type costs that I talked about earlier are going up.

David Smith
Autonomous Research US LP

And also, any particular color you could give on the jump in nonperforming loans in commercial real
estate?

Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer

Mark?

Mark G. Runkel
Senior Executive VP & Chief Transformation Officer

Yes. I would just say, they are really focused in on a couple of different industries that we've highlighted.
One is on the commercial side, there's really heavily energy and the retail sector. And then on the
commercial real estate is going to be some of the retail-related exposure as well. It's coming off a very
low point, if you note, but those are the industries that have been most impacted to date.

At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
