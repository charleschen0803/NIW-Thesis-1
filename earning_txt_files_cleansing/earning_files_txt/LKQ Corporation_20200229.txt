LKQ CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Thank you for joining LKQ Corporate's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Joe Boutross, LKQ's Vice President of Investor
Relations.

Joseph P. Boutross
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LKQ's First Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. With us today are Nick Zarcone, LKQ's President and Chief Executive Officer; Varun
Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to the LKQ website at
lkqcorp.com for our earnings release issued this morning as well as the accompanying slide presentation
for this call.

Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered
forward-looking. These include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or
strategies. Actual events or results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-
looking statements as a result of various factors. We assume no obligation to update any forward-
looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K and
subsequent reports filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial
measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release
and slide presentation.

Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to look at our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC earlier today. And as
normal, we are planning to file our 10-Q in the next few days.

And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. This morning, I will provide some high-level
comments related to our performance in the first quarter, discuss the revenue headwinds we are facing in
each of our segments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, provide an overview of the actions we are taking
during this very challenging time and finally describe some of the fallout our industry is experiencing.

Varun will dive into the financials with a key focus on the leverage we are pulling across the entire
organization to rightsize the cost structure and maximize cash flow. He will also discuss our liquidity and
the strength of our balance sheet before I come back with a few closing comments.

Clearly, a lot has changed in the last 60 days as we face this humanitarian tragedy. Our hearts go out to
all those impacted by the virus, both at LKQ and the population at large. The global effort to combat the
virus would not be possible without those on the front line, doctors, nurses, first responders and all those
putting themselves at risk to serve their communities in the communities where LKQ operates across
the globe. For that, I extend a big thank you and offer sincere appreciation from the LKQ family to those
individuals for their heroic services.

Taken as a whole, we got off to a great start in 2020 and are pleased with our first quarter results. In
order to understand the first quarter activity, one needs to separate the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period of
January and February from the month of March. Through February, each of our segments were in line or
ahead of our revenue and profit expectations. The efforts by governments around the world have flattened
the infection curve and slowed the spread of the virus through social distancing, self-isolation, shelter-at-
home orders and the like have had a profound negative impact on mobility and miles driven.

LKQ CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

While auto repairs and related parts supply has generally been deemed an essential service and we have
continued to serve the needs of our customers, activity levels at the repair shops in North America and
Europe has dropped precipitously. The speed at which the economic fallout from the virus prevention
measures has impacted all industries, reflects a rate never seen before. It was like operating within 2
completely separate economies during a single quarter. We clearly lost operating leverage in March with
the speed of the revenue decline outpacing our ability to reduce cost.

I'm going to use adjusted earnings per share as the proxy. The February year-to-date adjusted earnings
per share was up over 20% relative to the same period in 2019. While the month of March was down by
more than 27% despite having an additional selling day.

I will quickly address the Q1 results and then provide some detail on the revenue trends for each of our
reporting segments during the first few weeks of April.

As noted on Slide 11, total revenue for the first quarter was $3 billion, reflecting a 3.2% decrease from
the level recorded in the comparable period of 2019. Global parts and services of organic revenue declined
3.5% in the first quarter and 4.7% on a per day basis. The primary driver for this decrease was a 13.9%
per day organic revenue decline in the month of March when all the stay-at-home mandates begin to take
effect. From an earnings per share perspective, the first quarter results were solid with diluted EPS on a
GAAP basis of $0.48 compared to $0.31 last year. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS was $0.57 compared
to $0.56 or a 2% increase. With the negative impact of COVID-19 on the March 2020 monthly results, we
believe showing any year-over-year growth is an achievement and is a testament to the strength of our
business coming into 2020.

Now on to the segments. As witnessed during the financial crisis from 2007 to 2009, the automotive
aftermarket is fairly recession resistant, exhibiting a decline of only 1% during a period that saw new car
sales fall by 42%. Miles driven during that period declined less than 3%, but what we are witnessing today
is entirely different.

As you will note from Slide 10, organic revenue growth for parts and services for our North American
segment in the first quarter declined 4.2% or 5.6% on a per day basis. Looking solely at January and
February, North America organic revenue was down 1.1%, but the majority of that negative movement,
reflecting our decision to terminate the FCA battery contract in the fourth quarter of last year and to a
lesser amount due to a very warm winter season. CCC estimates that collision liability related repairable
claims in the first 2 months of 2020 were down about 4%, so we continued to outperform the market
as a whole. During March, we experienced organic revenue declines of 13.9% on a per day basis, with
most of that coming in the back half of the month compared to a CCC estimate for repairable claims in the
month of March being down by approximately 20%. For the entire quarter, the 4.2% organic decline was
significantly less than the 9.9% decrease in collision and liability related auto claims reported by CCC for
the first quarter as a whole.

I'd like to highlight that over the last 44 quarters through the full year 2019, our North American segment
has only witnessed 2 quarters of negative growth, a track record we are very proud of. I would also like
to highlight that despite the revenue decline, EBITDA margins in North America hit a high of 16% in Q1.
The organic revenue decline for parts and services for our European segment in the first quarter was 3.4%
or 4.5% on a per day basis. Again, this was mostly related to a 10.3% or 13.7% per day decline in the
month of March. Importantly, not all regions were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic at the same time,
creating a different growth profile for each of our European businesses in the quarter.

Italy was the first country to report a significant number of COVID-19 cases and the first to lock down the
mobility of its citizens, particularly in their heavily industrialized areas in the northern part of the country.
We saw an immediate impact on our Italian sourced revenue in the last week of February and the first
week of March. The U.K., on the other hand, did not issue stay-at-home orders until later in the month,
and revenue was in line with budget until the week of March 23 when it began a steep decline.

Lastly, during the first quarter, our Specialty segment had an organic revenue decline for parts and
services of 1.4% or 2.9% on a per day basis. Importantly, when looking at January and February
combined, Specialty witnessed a 4.3% organic revenue growth rate, with March declining 11%. It's

important to look at the January and February performance in isolation, given many were concerned that
the weakness Specialty witnessed in the fourth quarter would persist. And clearly, that was not the case
as we started 2020 very strong. I'd also like to acknowledge and congratulate our Specialty team on being
ranked the #1 national RV parts distributor to do business with, and #1 for having the fastest delivery in
the industry, both according to RV Pros annual dealer survey.

While Q1 results were reasonably strong, our industry certainly left the quarter on a very soft note
and the first few weeks of April were even weaker. So where is the activity level in our industry and for
our company? According to a report published by McKinsey & Company, during the week of March 17,
the headwinds from social distancing reduced miles driven in the United States by 40% to 50%, and
accident frequency was down by up to 60% in certain key markets. Also, consumer surveys conducted
by McKinsey, show that U.S. households are trying to reduce their trips by roughly 50%, with 45% of the
respondents expecting to delay any auto repair servicing. INRIX, which provides vehicle traffic and parking
data and analytics, reported that across the 98 metropolitan areas that it's currently tracking, total travel
during the week of April 4 was down 51% from what it was in the corresponding week in February. In
addition, the U.S. Energy Information Administration has indicated gasoline consumption declined 50%
from mid-March to April 3.

Further evidence of low volumes, in the last month alone, the top 5 U.S. auto insurance carriers have
given over $6 billion in rebates to their policyholders because of the dramatic drop in the accident
frequency from lower miles driven, which are pushing insurance loss costs lower. Snapsheet, an automatic
insurance claims processor that works with 85 different insurance carriers reported that collision-related
claims in late March were down 40% to 50%, which could possibly be the bottom of the business in the
last 50 years. The 40% to 50% drop in claims and repair volume was echoed in a March 27 press release
by the Boyd Group, which is one of the largest MSOs in the collision repair industry. While Service King,
another large MSO, issued a release on April 15, indicating they had closed 40 of their repair facilities due
to low demand.

Europe is also witnessing similar headwinds. According to an Apple mobility trends report, during the first
3 weeks of April, driving declined over 50% in our top 5 European markets. With that as a backdrop, it
should be no surprise that during the month of April, our daily revenue has been trending about 40%
below 2019 levels.

In North America, salvage revenue has been closer to the 35% down mark with recycled engines and
transmissions performing better than collision parts. Aftermarket collision parts is down more than 40%,
while glass and paint are down about 42% and 36%, respectively.

In Europe, the revenue declines in April vary by region, with our operations in Germany and Central and
Eastern Europe, reflecting declines of approximately 25%. The Benelux region being down about 40%, the
U.K. being down 50% and Italy being down over 60%. When taken together, for the month of April, we
are trending about 40% below last year. Our Specialty unit started the month down 40% compared to last
year, the last week saw an uptick in activity and April will likely come in down 30%.

The main question all businesses are facing is how long these conditions will persist. And frankly, the
answer is impossible to predict. What we can focus on is the here and now and address the dynamics that
we can effectively control.

Governments around the globe are trying to figure out both when and how to reopen their economies.
When the lockdown measures are lifted, we do believe vehicles will start getting back on the road, but we
don't anticipate miles driven will snap back to pre-COVID-19 levels immediately.

Over the past week, we have seen slight increases in activity in most of our businesses relative to earlier
in April. But those upticks are relative to the recent lows, and it's too early to determine whether they are
sustainable. There is significant uncertainty in the market, but we are working under the assumption that
these depressed levels will persist through a good part of Q2, with demand beginning to see a modest
rebound in Q3 and heading towards more normalized levels in Q4, but likely not back to 100% until
sometime in 2021. As the pandemic began to accelerate and governments began to implement public

safety measures, it was apparent that our mode of operation also needed to change because of the health
and safety of our teams, our customers and suppliers.

Almost immediately, across our global footprint, every major operation developed a COVID-19 response
team to share ideas and stay informed. Each of our segments has a group responsible for pushing
valuable information throughout its ranks and for helping to ensure we are maintaining a safe workplace.
Our efforts related to enhanced hygiene and sanitation, social distancing and the use of PPE, all has an
impact on productivity, but it's the right thing to do.

Simultaneous with these enhanced safety efforts and as soon as revenue began to fall, we started to
aggressively attack our cost structure. We have initiated a variety of headcount actions, including the
elimination of all overtime and temporary workers, extensive employee furloughs, permanent reductions
in our workforce, decreased hours for many still on the payroll and participating in some of the social
programs offered to employers in several European countries. Through these various efforts, as of last
Friday, we had effectively neutralized the cost of over 16,750 employees. Said another way, in a matter of
a few short weeks, we have largely removed the cost of approximately 1/3 of our global workforce. The
numbers are both staggering and incredibly painful, particularly for a company that believes our biggest
asset is our people. But payroll-related items in aggregate represent our single largest SG&A expense
category. So these very difficult decisions were necessary to protect the long-term health of our company.

In addition to the headcount adjustments, we have also instituted salary reductions effective in April;
eliminate most all-discretionary, non-mission-critical spending; instituted a ban on business travel;
accelerated the pace of branch closures, both temporary and permanent and focused on the overall
efficiency of our distribution networks and route structures across each segment.

When viewed on a company-wide basis, over the past few weeks between our concerted actions and
normal variable elements, the cost footprint of our company has been temporarily reduced by $80
million to $90 million per month, reflecting an annualized run rate of approximately $1 billion. While we
don't anticipate actually saving $1 billion as we will need to bring our people back onto the payroll and
add costs back into the business as volumes begin to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, it highlights the
magnitude of the cost adjustments we've made. With respect to the 1 LKQ effort in Europe, the new
revenue environment has required us to hit the pause button on some elements of the program, like the
new ERP deployment, which was going to require a large team of people to be in Italy, the location of our
next deployment.

We have also delayed some of the other organizational changes. We have, however, accelerated some
other programs such as the rationalization of some of our branches, particularly in Central and Eastern
Europe. With revenue running at just 60% of pre-COVID-19 levels, it's virtually impossible to gauge
the near-term benefits of the 1 LKQ Europe program, but we remain convinced it is the right long-term
strategy for our business.

Varun will provide more detail on the cost-saving initiatives in a few minutes. When COVID-19 first
surfaced in China back in January, the immediate concern was the potential impact on the world's supply
chain. I'm happy to report that our supply chain is intact, and we have not experienced any major
disruptions in terms of inventory shortages or stock outs. Indeed, we started 2020 with a high level of
inventory as we headed into the seasonally strong selling period. We have been working with our suppliers
to secure full availability of our aftermarket product range during the crisis. While some aftermarket
parts suppliers furnishing our various businesses have experienced some reductions in capacity, we have
reduced replenishment orders as our revenue has declined. On balance, we believe we will not have
material issues with our aftermarket supply chain going forward.

On the salvage side, as miles driven and the number of total losses have both decreased dramatically,
the number of cars available at the auctions has declined as well. It will take some time for this particular
supply chain to gear back up as it can often take up to 60 to 70 days for a totaled car to reach the
auction. So we're confident that we can manage our purchasing and utilize existing inventory to meet
customer demand for recycled products.

LKQ CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

I'd like to extend a sincere thank you to all of our supply partners as they also confront this pandemic and
are working hard to help us to continue to service our customers.

Like any economic downturn, some businesses will suffer more than others. And given the absolute violent
nature of this contraction, we believe it will be true even in the historically resistant auto parts sector.
The speed and magnitude of the demand shift will be too much for some of the less well-capitalized
distributors to endure. Already, there have been some smaller distributors in the U.S. that have shut their
door, at least on a temporary basis while waiting for federal funding to arrive.

In Europe, one of the largest online parts distributors, ATP, declared insolvency. [ La Ran ], a large
distributor in France, is in bankruptcy and [ Hart ], a large Polish distributor, closed its doors for several
weeks before just reopening this past Monday. There will be more. While it does little in the near term,
longer term, it means that there will be a natural consolidation of industry demand amongst a fewer
number of market participants. With leading positions in most all of our respective markets, I believe LKQ
is well positioned to take advantage of these subtle shifts in the competitive landscape. To be sure, the
downturn will also impact the repair shops, and we would expect a similar reallocation of demand to the
larger, better capitalized organization. We have a close watch in our receivables to ensure we get paid for
the parts already delivered and installed. And not unlike during the Great Recession, we have seen a total
collapse of new vehicle SAAR across the globe.

In the United States, new car sales fell about 13% in the first quarter and 38% in the month of March. In
the European Union, new car sales were even softer, dropping 25% in the first quarter compared to last
year, with a 55% decline in March. We anticipate the April and May results on a global basis will look more
like March than January. So the second quarter will likely be very soft as well. These massive declines in
new car sales will ultimately lead to an older car park, which favors the aftermarket parts industry and will
ultimately be good for LKQ. At this point, I will turn the call over to Varun.

Varun Laroyia
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. What a difference 60 days can make.
We ended February feeling really good about the start of the year and our prospects for 2020. And now we
are working through a global pandemic that has impacted lives and economies in ways that have not been
seen in generations. In these unusual circumstances, I will deviate from the usual commentary and focus
on forward-looking matters as opposed to our latest quarterly results. Nick has already commented on the
revenue trend, so I will handle the cost actions we have taken as well as our liquidity position.

However, to start, I am going to briefly discuss the financial highlights from our first quarter. North
America reported segment EBITDA margin of 16.4%, a 280 basis point improvement relative to the prior
year. The improvement is driven by gross margin expansion. While a portion of the benefit is attributable
to the several ongoing margin initiatives, increased revenue from precious metals and better pricing
realized sequentially on scrap metal represented the largest incremental growth driver.

Continuing a trend discussed on the last quarter's call, precious metals prices surged to record levels in
early 2020, providing significant upside in both our wholesale and self-service businesses. In April trading,
we've seen moderating prices of precious metals going to lower new car sales and do not expect the same
level of upside in the near term. Overall, gross margins in wholesale operations and self-service increased
by 210 and 90 basis points, respectively, with a further 20 basis point improvement from the mix effect
resulting from the disposal of our aviation business in the third quarter of 2019.

Europe segment EBITDA margin of 5.7% represented a 160 basis point decrease relative to 2019. Do
note that this includes approximately 30 basis points of incremental transformation expenses incurred in
the quarter. On a positive note, gross margin for the segment increased by 40 basis points. The negative
leverage effect from the sales decline in March as the stay-in-shelter programs began, the incremental
transformation expenses and certain unfavorable reserve adjustments pushed overhead expenses up 220
basis points compared to 2019.

LKQ CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Specialty reported a segment EBITDA margin of 9.2%, a 150 basis point decrease relative to the prior
year. Gross margin declined by 110 basis points due to unfavorable mixed effects and an increase in
inventory reserves. At a consolidated level, net interest expense decreased by $10 million, owing to
the lower average debt levels and a lower average interest rate. This variance is the direct result of the
excellent work our teams have done over the past 18-plus months to focus on cash flow, allowing us to
pay down debt in the trailing 12 months. We have also benefited from the redemption of our 4.75% U.S.
senior notes in January of this year, financing it with cash and borrowings from lower cost facilities.

Our effective tax rate was 29.2% for the quarter, which included a 250 basis point increase over the
annual effective rate assumed in our guidance, resulting in a $0.02 per share negative effect on adjusted
diluted EPS, again, relative to prior guidance. The rate increase is primarily attributable to the impact of
lower projected full year pretax income, which results in higher suspended interest deductions in certain
foreign jurisdictions. We expect volatility in the tax rate this year, given the potential for varying outcomes
in our full year results.

Operating cash flows in the quarter were $195 million, which represented a 10% increase over the same
period in 2019. Free cash flow of $150 million was a 21% improvement over the prior year, leading to
a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x based on our credit facility definitions. We use our free cash flow
along with cash on hand to repay $230 million of debt and returned $88 million to our stockholders in the
quarter. We were happy to see the momentum of 2019 cash flow generation carried through into the first
quarter.

Now I'll move into our plans for the remainder of 2020. As Nick referenced earlier, the drop in revenue
during March took place very quickly as governments implemented measures to contain the outbreak.
With restrictions and movement put in place across multiple countries, we understood the demand would
decline for reasons that were outside of our control. And so we shifted our attention to what we could
control. That is: one, reducing costs to reflect the new level of market demand; and two, continuing to
focus on cash flow generation.

Each of our segments took immediate action to develop and implement a plan to rationalize their
respective cost structure. Nick described the key aspects of our cost reductions, which essentially fall
into 3 categories: one, personnel-related actions; two, variable cost decreases that follow the lower
projected revenue, including route consolidations and branch rationalizations; and three, the elimination of
discretionary and non-mission-critical spending.

Our current estimates indicate a run rate savings of roughly $80 million to $90 million a month. More than
half that reduction is attributable to headcount-related actions as it is the largest line item in our operating
costs. We won't reach the full run rate savings during April as we will continue to incur employee costs
related to paid time off until those hours are exhausted and the continuation of healthcare benefits for
a further period. Our plans are dynamic, and we will be adjusting them based on developments with the
outlook on the COVID-19 virus. We will be diligent in not bringing the expense back early and intend to
wait for a sustained revenue improvement before adding costs back into the business.

To reinforce the point Nick made earlier, the cost actions include the deferral of certain elements of our 1
LKQ Europe program also. The decision to delay portions of the project, including the establishment of our
head office in Switzerland, was a difficult one given the long-term benefits anticipated from the program.
However, our current focus is to protect our employees, and the business during this market disruption.
We are committed to fully returning to the program once conditions have stabilized. The deferral, along
with the impacts of COVID-19 on our volume, compromises our ability to deliver on the margin goals that
we presented in our September 10, 2019, investor presentation.

However, as the fog lifts on the duration and the severity of the COVID-19 induced disruption, we
will reassess and communicate the project timeline and our margin expectations. In addition to the
COVID-19 cost actions, we have also initiated a restructuring program. These plans reflect a further
round of rightsizing and integration in our North America and European operations and focus on closing
underperforming operations. We expect to incur costs related to severance, facility closures and asset
impairment charges amounting to a range of $50 million to $60 million, of which approximately 20% will

be noncash. The benefits of the program are anticipated to begin in the second quarter, but have not
projected to reach the full run rate benefit until early next year.

We are often asked what percentage of our overhead costs are fixed versus variable. And there's not really
a simple answer. We have fixed costs, such as facility rent, variable costs such as fuel consumption and
sales commissions. And then finally, hybrid costs that can be adjusted at different levels of activity but do
not flex up and down with every revenue dollar change. For example, we may be able to run a warehouse
with 10 employees at a certain level of revenue. If the revenue increases or decreases by, say, 3%, we
may not need to add or cut any headcount.

However, if the revenue were to decline by 20%, we would expect to reduce our warehouse headcount
and potentially the number of drivers, too. Reacting to the pandemic has highlighted this dynamic as we
have had to cut deep into a hybrid cost pool in an attempt to align the cost structure with the projected
demand.

As shown on Slide 6, forecasted reductions in variable and hybrid costs represent approximately 30%
of our monthly overhead expenses. While we are pleased with the team's efforts to reduce costs, it will
be difficult to only cut our way to profitability. We retain a certain fixed cost base, including facility rent
and administrative expenses that will be more challenging to decrease. Additionally, we must cover
approximately $175 million of annual depreciation and amortization expense, excluding amortization of
acquisition-related intangibles, which we add back in calculating adjusted diluted EPS and approximately
$115 million of annual interest expense that can't be easily flexed. We are currently projecting the largest
negative impact from the COVID-19 virus in Q2 with a gradual revenue and profitability improvement as
the year progresses. So as you all know, this could easily change as the pandemic and the global response
plays out over time.

Moving to liquidity. We feel that we're in a good position to withstand the COVID-19 disruption. As I
referenced earlier, there has been a significant shift in the world in the last couple of months. On February
20 of this year, we reported over $1 billion in operating cash flows for 2019 and set guidance at a similar
level for 2020. Our net leverage ratio was 2.6x compared to the maximum allowed ratio of 4.25x. As
our cash flow generation programs have taken hold since 2018 and continued to increase the absolute
level of cash being generated by each of our businesses, liquidity and debt covenants were low on the
list of concerns going into 2020. Then the COVID-19 outbreak spread across the globe, and folks became
interested in everyone's ability to comply with their respective financial covenants and retain access to the
credit markets.

I'll address our liquidity status in 2 pieces: first, our current liquidity position and efforts to conserve cash;
and second, the compliance requirements for our financing arrangements. We believe that our current
liquidity and positive operating cash flow in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating
and capital requirements. To support our liquidity position during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are focused
on preserving cash during the expected period of reduced demand. Our action plans to strengthen our
current position include approximately 40% reduction of more than $100 million deferral of growth driven
and non-mission-critical capital projects, reductions in inventory replenishment rates to reflect current
demand, active monitoring of customer receivables and terms, the continuation of the European vendor
financing program, tax payment deferrals where allowable and halt in our share buyback program in
addition to the cost-saving measures previously discussed.

With $1.9 billion of total liquidity as of March 31, 2020, and $91 million of current maturities, we have
access to funds to meet our near-term commitments, even if the pandemic effect extends longer than
current expectations. We have a surplus of current assets over current liabilities of over $2 billion, which
further reduces the risk of short-term cash shortfalls. Our total liquidity includes availability on our senior
secured credit facility, which includes 2 financial maintenance covenants, maximum net leverage ratio and
minimum interest coverage ratio.

The maximum net leverage ratio will be 4x effective our compliance certificate to be filed for the second
quarter of 2020. We are confident that we will be in compliance with the financial covenants in the second
quarter, though out of an abundance of caution and as an effective insurance policy, we have commenced

discussions with our bank group regarding continued access to borrowings under our credit facility if the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has a severe and prolonged negative impact on our profitability.

Our euro notes do not include financial maintenance covenants and the indentures will not restrict our
ability to draw funds on the credit facility, nor will the indentures prohibit our ability to amend the financial
covenants under the credit facility as needed. By limiting our capital spending to mission-critical projects
and the strategic central distribution center in the Netherlands, we will preserve cash to support day-to-
day operations while generating a benefit to our depreciation expense for the year. We will be judicious
in balancing the cash generation while continuing to invest thoughtfully into the business and creating a
long-term sustainable advantage, and we are confident of being cash flow positive for the full year.

Interestingly, while April is expected to be the worst month for revenue and profitability, I am happy to
report that the company did not need to draw down on the credit facility. And instead, we were able to pay
down further debt in the month.

Finally, I'd like to close with a few comments regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year. As you
know, we withdrew our full year guidance last month given the uncertainty created by the COVID-19
outbreak. Presently, there are too many unknowns to be able to provide full year guidance on revenue
and profitability measures. However, to prepare our March financials, we've made a good-faith estimate
of the full year results based on information currently available, and our assumptions include a severe
short-term impact followed by a gradual return to prior levels by 2021. This projection supports our
analysis underlying the March financial statements including our interim goodwill impairment test, other
impairment tests of intangible assets, assessments of the recoverability of inventory, calculation of the
annual effective tax rate and evaluations of the realizability of deferred tax assets. As the economic impact
of the pandemic is dependent on variables that are difficult to project, and in many cases, outside of our
control, it is possible that the estimates underlying our analysis may change in future periods.

We are committed to providing investors with clear and comprehensive disclosure regarding our results
and future prospects, and we will share developments as appropriate going forward.

With that, I will turn the call back to Nick for closing remarks.

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Varun. In closing, it is clear that our focus on profitable growth, enhanced margins and better
free cash flow generation, positioned us well as we entered this unexpected turn of events. Our teams
have been agile and have done a fantastic job of tackling the cost structure, which is no easy task,
especially when confronting the human element of these actions and a culture that is rooted in pride and
comradery.

Our teams have embraced the idea that not all progress is measured by ground gained, but sometimes
progress is measured by losses avoided. And for that, I am tremendously proud and thankful of
everyone's effort to confront these very difficult times.

What I know is when the pandemic is in the rearview mirror and the economies around the world settle
into the new normal, whatever that may be, there will still be more than 275 million vehicles in the
United States and over 305 million vehicles in Europe. The average age of these cars will increase and
the resulting heightened demand for alternative repair parts and accessories will be serviced by a slightly
smaller number of competitors. Therein lies the opportunity for LKQ. That is why I have been coaching our
leadership teams to focus both on getting us through the near-term headwinds and to also keep one eye
open for the longer-term opportunities to gain market share and create more efficient operating models.
I'm confident that LKQ will not just survive the pandemic, but will thrive in the post pandemic economy.

In my communication with a broader employee base, I have indicated, we will get through this together
and we'll come out a stronger, wiser and better-positioned organization that continues to be LKQ proud.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephanie Benjamin with SunTrust.

Stephanie Benjamin
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

I really appreciate all the extra color that you guys provided, particularly as you broke out just the
performance kind of through the first half of the quarter or more than that. And then kind of how it
deteriorated in March, including the CCC numbers? I was hoping maybe you could provide a little bit of
color. I mean it was such a strong outperformance versus the industry during those periods, whether it
was the January through February and then also in March. So maybe you could provide some color on
what you believe was driving that outperformance versus the overall just kind of volume numbers from
the CCC numbers. I think that would be helpful.

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

I'll take a shot at that, Stephanie. What we offer to the North American collision repair industry is an
ability to provide best-in-class service, and that goes to items like delivery times, the number of deliveries,
on-time deliveries, the depth and breadth of our inventory, which -- what we have, nobody else can
match. And we believe that we have always outperformed the marketplace because we offer a different
value proposition than most of our smaller competitors. And particularly, when things started to slow
down, and a number of businesses were really having to pull in quickly, our capital base allows us to
continue to provide what we believe is world-class customer service.

And over time, that wins. But make no doubt, we always believe that the depth and breadth of our
inventory is perhaps our biggest competitive advantage in the North American marketplace and the ability
to get those parts to our customers on a reliable basis and a very quick basis, separates us from many in
the industry.

Stephanie Benjamin
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Well, for the sake of time, I'll pass it on from there.

Your next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

On the North American gross margin, you called out metals, scrap and precious metals driving a big
chunk. Could you tell us how many basis points you picked up on metals, just so we can get a normal
margin run rate?

Varun Laroyia
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Bret, it's Varun here. Great question. Essentially, within our overall salvage operations, we do not
break out precious metals on a car by car or an automotive -- on a unit-by-unit basis. What we do know
is precious metals alone had close to a $50 million uptick in revenue on a year-over-year basis. So as
you think about it from that perspective, you can kind of do the math in terms of how much of that
can actually flow through. There is a cost associated with getting to the precious metals that are found
within the salvage vehicles. But again, as I said previously also, in the last quarter earnings numbers, our
operating teams have just done a phenomenal job in positioning themselves to be able to extract and take

advantage of what's happening in the precious market -- in the precious metals market. So again, happy
with the way they've performed in kind of essentially making their own destiny from that perspective.

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And at some point in time, the cost of the vehicle goes up or it falls based on the value of those
metals. And what we've seen, as Varun indicated in his prepared comments, is those values have come
back down, not all the way back to where they were at the beginning of the year, but they have come
back in.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel.

Michael Edward Hoffman
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Trying to take all of this great data in. In the first pass, quickly trying to adjust the model on the fly, you'll
still be profitable in 2Q, but it's going to be paper thin, is that the right way to think about it?

Varun Laroyia
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, Michael, it's Varun here. It all depends in terms of how the trend continues. As I -- as Nick mentioned
in his comments also, the first half of April was a continuation of March, which was down almost like 40%,
45%. In the last 10, 12 days, we've seen some nice little uptick. But having said that, it is still down on
a year-over-year basis. It all depends in terms of what the outlook is for the month of May and June.
We also do know that in the month of April here in the United States, for example, with the folks that
we've put on furlough, we essentially have allowed our folks to be able to run down their PTO balances.
Essentially, we are paying them, which we believe will get exhausted by the end of April. In addition, we
have continued health benefits for a certain period. This is not the time to be pulling the rug from people's
-- from under people's feet given what's happening out in the broader macroeconomic situation in any
case.

So April, we know from a profitability perspective, will be challenged, but it all depends in terms of how
May and June comes through. What we have said is that we have suspended guidance. And again, as
and when numbers begin to come through for April month end, and again, as we go through the quarter,
we will update the markets. We do have a series of virtual NDRs and investor calls set up for later in the
quarter. But again, at this point of time, we are not in the position to say as to where Q2 will be coming
through. It all depends in terms of how the next 60 days play out.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird.

Craig R. Kennison
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

You've mentioned competitive disruption. I guess to the extent your competitors are struggling and you
are able to take share, can you serve that opportunity through your existing operations? Or would you
need to expand branches or acquire businesses in some geographies to cover that potential opportunity?

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

Craig, great question. No, we're convinced that we have the footprint we need in most every market in
which we operate to service more customers and with more volume. And as -- actually, I think both Varun
and I put in our formal remarks, we're actually going to be consolidating some of the branch network
across the globe to gain further efficiencies.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

LKQ CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

As these volumes have come in, we will -- there is opportunity to get to even a more efficient footprint.
And we believe, even though some of that is going to be on a permanent basis, that we will still be able to
fulfill an even heightened demand that will ultimately come out of this.

Varun Laroyia
Executive VP & CFO

And Craig, I'll just going to add one more to what -- our data point -- to what Nick mentioned. In terms
of the hypothesis that this will end up by potentially being a gain share for LKQ, I understand it's still
early days, but across each of our 3 operating segments, we are seeing customers that we haven't seen
in quite some time, and I'm talking of a few years. So both in North America and in Europe and then also
in our Specialty unit, we are seeing activity from customers that we haven't seen for some time. And
again, data is hard to come by in certain markets. But even where markets are down, what we are picking
up from a market intel is that we are outperforming our competitors in those specific markets. So back
to your hypothesis, it is playing out now. And then to the additional point whether we need to expand
our footprint, no, we believe our footprint is adequate. And in fact, we actually have an opportunity to
essentially fine tune our geographic footprint through this period.

Operator

Your next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.

Gary Frank Prestopino
Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division

Just a quick question here in terms of your customer base on the repair side. I mean is it more or less the
80-20 rule that you're doing

80% of the business with the 20-largest percent across both North America and Europe?

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

No, it's not quite that -- this way, Gary. The customer base is incredibly fragmented. I mean there is --
in the United States, for example, somewhere between 35,000 and 40,000 collision and repair shops.
In Europe, there's literally hundreds of thousands of mechanical service and repair shops. So there are
bigger entities there. We've got the MSOs on the collision and repair side in North America. You got some
large chains over in Europe. But it's -- no, it's not 80-20. So this is an industry. Our customer base is an
industry that's represented by an incredibly fragmented group of competitors.

Gary Frank Prestopino
Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division

So is there any worries on a short-term basis, at least with some of these smaller players coming -- falling
out of bed here, just closing shop, like you were talking about some of the competitive situation of other
suppliers in Europe that are declaring bankruptcy?

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

Absolutely. Whenever you have a severe economic contraction, small enterprises, this mom-and-pop
enterprises oftentimes just don't have the capital to endure. We actually have sponsored and promoted
some educational sessions for our North American customer base to get them tapped into how to best
utilize the government programs that have been put in place to fund small and medium-sized businesses.
And so we ran and sponsored seminars that our body shop customers could dial into to understand how to
navigate the loan program, for an example, because we want them to succeed. We want them to stay in
business.

We have a follow-up from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.

LKQ CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Bret David Jordan
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

You talked about, I guess, Service King having shut a number of their branches. I think they also delayed
a bond payment recently as well. Do you have any exposure either to them or any other major collision
chains that you have to worry about as far as getting paid back at accounts receivable?

Varun Laroyia
Executive VP & CFO

Bret, it's Varun. Let me take that question. Listen, as we closed out the first quarter of 2020, I will share
with you. And again, this is the appropriate time to share it with everyone is the company has never
been in a better position in terms of managing our past due receivables. Again these things don't happen
by accident. We started a program, probably, in the better part of almost 2 years ago because there
was a massive opportunity in terms of the way customer receivables were being managed. So again,
as we closed out, we were in a very fortunate position, thanks to the phenomenal work of all our field
operators, both here in North America, but also in Europe. To your specific question about one of our
larger customers, we enjoy a great relationship with them. And yes, we also heard about the news,
but I'm happy to report that as of the end of the first quarter, we were current with them across their
receivables balance.

And then with regards to, call it, other customers and stuff, listen, this is a evolving situation as of now.
Nick mentioned the fact that we have a fairly fragmented customer base. The good news is several of our
smaller customers do have the ability to drop on the payment protection -- the Paycheck Protection Plan.
And we, certainly, are encouraging them to apply through the SBA side of things, in any case.

But other than that, happy in terms of how we remain close to our customers. And again, we are confident
on their ability to, again, gain share through this period. But again, no specific issues with receivable hits
as such.

Operator

Your next question is going to be a follow-up from Michael Hoffman with Stifel.

Michael Edward Hoffman
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

So circling back, I think to get the point of clarity, if I could, on an early question. You shared $15 million
of incremental sales in the quarter for metals, did I hear that correctly? So they gave you 100% credit for
that? Because it was all price. Forget that you had cost. I pulled that out of the 2011 on the EBITDA. You
still are 15% margins. Is that -- am I doing something wrong? Just want to understand.

Varun Laroyia
Executive VP & CFO

No, Michael. The math is appropriate, except for the fact that precious metals was close to $50 5-0
million up on a year-over-year basis. That's the piece you got to think about. The second point is what
we are currently seeing in April trading of precious metals, they have come off their record highs that
we experienced earlier in the first quarter. So again, we do not anticipate that set of gains to be on an
ongoing basis. The other piece to think about is, as we always talked about on the salvage side scrap
metal prices, while they were down on a year-over-year basis, it's more kind of the sequential pricing,
which matters to us. And sequentially, scrap metal was up about 23%. So that also helped the overall
North American margin. So that's how you should think about this. But again, precious metals was by far
the biggest piece. But as I said, we don't anticipate that upside to continue, at least not in the near term.

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

But directionally -- correct, Michael. Even without the impact of the metals, our margins would have been
up.

LKQ CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Michael Edward Hoffman
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Right. Okay. That's -- I was trying to get at that. And then back to the $80 million to $90 million, is there
a way to think about how that plays out between the 2 major regions as far as where it comes from,
where you can get savings? And then how much -- if you learn to be leaner, how much of it do you get to
keep permanently? I mean I get you can't keep a whole $1 billion, but how much do you think you might
keep?

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

Well, half of -- as Varun indicated, about half of the $80 million to $90 million is people-related. And
those adjustments have been made in each of the 3 segments: North America, Specialty and Europe. We
have more people in Europe to start with. So you should assume that the majority of the 17,000 person
adjustment that came out of Europe, North America next and Specialty, obviously, being the smallest.

All of our operating heads are working under the orders and the assumption that when we get back to
100% of revenue volume, whenever that is, that we should be able to service that without adding back all
17,000 people. That there has to be some embedded productivity gains coming out of that process. We
don't have, at this point in time, the magic answer as to whether that's adding back 99% of our people or
95% of the people or 90% of the people. But we do anticipate that we will gain productivity from a human
capital perspective. And the same with some of the other operating costs, again, there are things we're
going to have to add back. But importantly, as Varun indicated, we kind of do it kind of in arrears, is we're
going to make sure that revenue is there and sustainable and then add some back, and it will be a gradual
process as we walk back up with the hope that when we get to the -- when we get back to 100%, we will
not have added back 100% of the operating expense.

Varun Laroyia
Executive VP & CFO

And Michael, to your specific question of how much of it is between the 2 geographies, it's roughly half
and half. So of the $80 million to $90 million, roughly half in Europe and the other half here in North
America. And then with regards to the key categories, just to reiterate, personnel cost is, by far, the single
largest line item in our overall OpEx. And so that clearly is the vast bulk of it. But then in addition to
that, we do know that there are certain variable expenses such as the spend that we have on routes and
deliveries and fuel. And we certainly are picking up that variability also as revenues have come in. So just
kind of give you that additional color for the sake of comprehensiveness.

Michael Edward Hoffman
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And since we're repeating or turning the thing, may I ask one more, just if I could, for the benefit
of everybody. The world recovers. We get -- we start to [ get back ] again, whenever it is, but it recovers.
Do we get back to a nor -- a old revenue number in the U.S. from a collision standpoint? Or I mean, I
get why we would in Europe on maintenance. You got to -- if you're driving your car, you got to do the
maintenance. How do I get back to the old revenue number? I felt like I'm going to have a whole bunch
more above-average accidents.

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

Ultimately, when the miles driven gets back to kind of pre-COVID levels, and people are kind of back into
their normal routines, the accident rates will -- from a frequency perspective, will move back, we believe,
to where they were pre-virus, right? Once the roads and the highways are full of cars and other vehicles,
and that's really what's the key, Michael, is the number of accidents because that's what drives repair
volumes and ultimately, what drives the demand for the repair parts that we supply to the body shops.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

LKQ CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 30, 2020

Yes. So we're comfortable that in time, assuming miles driven gets back that the frequency will return,
and that will be a strong driver of our revenue. The $64 question is when does that all occur, right?
There's anecdotal data out there. Now it's from China. So it's a very different economy, right? But what
the Chinese have reported is that about 2.5 to 3 months after them hitting peak from a virus-infection
perspective, miles driven in individual vehicles was at 80% of precrisis levels. Contrast that to their public
transportation volumes, which were only back to 40% of pre-crisis levels. So folks, at least in China,
we clearly view their personal vehicle as being a safer mode of transportation than jumping on public
transport.

And that's a good sign, right? What it suggests is that the same could happen here in the U.S. but just
because the -- either on a federal basis or on a state basis, some of the restrictions get lifted, nobody
should assume that miles driven is going to snap back to pre-virus levels. I mean I sit here in the state
of Texas and our governor, on Tuesday, indicated that he was going to "open up" -- start to open up the
Texas economy this coming Friday. And that's great because there's all sorts of businesses that have been
shut down.

On the same day, one of the local news stations did a survey of 3,500 residents of Austin, and 86% of
them said, it was too much too soon. So even though some of the restrictions may be lifted, it remains to
be seen as to whether residents around the world are going to have the courage to actually venture out
immediately and get back into their normal routines. We think it's going to be much more of a gradual
return.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc.

Daniel Robert Imbro
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I think I dropped off for a second. So sorry if you touched on this. But Varun, I wanted to touch back
on Europe and the 1Q. Something that stood out to us just the gross margin leverage despite pretty
soft sales there. We talked a lot about North America and the metals pricing. But can you shed some
more light on what drove the gross margin improvement in Europe? And then how you think about the
sustainability of those drivers, obviously, as near-term demand trends are pressured?

Varun Laroyia
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. I think Daniel, let's find out here, just for the sake of everyone understanding. I think your
question was, there was a 40 basis point improvement in gross margin across our European segment
and the sustainability of that. So yes, very happy with the way that has come through. The level of
discipline that our teams have been putting out in Europe in the pursuit of profitable revenue growth and
accretive margins. That has continued to kind of come through in the past, where we may have been
kind of chasing the last dime down the rabbit hole, that discipline that the team has picked up has been
tremendous.

And in these circumstances, chasing any and all revenue could become a fool's errand. And so essentially,
the teams have been focusing on only pursuing profitable revenue. In addition to that, as you know, we've
been doing well from a centralized procurement perspective, and those benefits have also accrued. But
just think about the fact that we've just been very disciplined from a pricing perspective, and that was
something that was much needed over in Europe in addition to everything that the team has been doing
from a centralized procurement perspective.

Dominick P. Zarcone
President, CEO & Director

We're going to need to bring the call to a close. So just one last question, and then we'll wrap up. We're a
bit over.

Did you have one last question, Daniel?
