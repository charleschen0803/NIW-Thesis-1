Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Lisa. Lisa?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our business performed extremely
well in the third quarter as our leadership product portfolio and strong execution drove record quarterly
revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share. We delivered our fifth straight quarter
of greater than 50% year-over-year revenue growth, with each of our businesses growing significantly
year-over-year and data center sales more than doubling. Third quarter revenue grew 54% to $4.3 billion.
Gross margin expanded by more than 4 percentage points and operating income doubled year-over-year.

Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Third quarter revenue increased 44% year-over-
year to $2.4 billion, driven by our latest generation Ryzen, Radeon and AMD Instinct processors. In
client computing, sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year and declined slightly
sequentially. Ryzen 5000 processor shipments increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially,
resulting in a richer product mix as we believe we gained revenue share for the sixth straight quarter.

In desktops, we launched our Ryzen 5000 processors with integrated Radeon graphics for the channel to
strong demand as third-party reviews highlighted the leadership computing and graphics capabilities and
energy efficiency of these processors. In notebooks, Acer, Asus, HP and Lenovo, all expanded their mobile

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

offerings powered by Ryzen 5000 mobile processors as we continue gaining momentum in the premium
consumer, gaming and commercial markets.

Commercial client growth year-over-year was based on new deployments across public sector and Fortune
1000 technology, energy and automotive customers as the number of AMD-based commercial notebook
designs available from the largest OEMs increased significantly year-over-year. We're also seeing strong
growth in the workstation market. According to IDC, Threadripper PRO processors now powered the best-
selling workstations in their category in both North America and EMEA as we continue winning high-
volume deployments across key verticals including media and entertainment, engineering, architecture
and automotive.

In Graphics, revenue more than doubled year-over-year and grew by a strong double-digit percentage
sequentially, driven by shipments of our next-generation AMD CDNA 2 data center GPUs and demand for
Radeon 6000 GPUs in the channel. AMD RDNA 2 GPU sales grew significantly in the quarter as we ramped
production and expanded our top to bottom portfolio with the launch of the midrange Radeon RX 6600 XT
cards that deliver leadership 1080p gaming performance at their price point. Data center graphics revenue
more than doubled year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, led by shipments of our new AMD CDNA 2
GPUs for the Frontier exascale supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Frontier was architected specifically to deliver breakthrough HPC and AI compute performance and
provide a blueprint for how supercomputing, enterprise and cloud customers can enable exascale-level
performance over the coming years by combining AMD CPUs, GPUs and software. We are very pleased
with the performance of our AMD CDNA 2 GPUs and look forward to providing more details on their
leadership performance next month.

Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue increased 69% year-over-year
to $1.9 billion, driven by strong growth in EPYC processor and semi-custom sales. Semi-custom revenue
grew sequentially and year-over-year as demand for the latest Microsoft and Sony consoles remains very
strong. We expect semi-custom revenue to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter as we further ramp
supply to address the ongoing game console demand.

Turning to server. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of record server processor revenue as sales more
than doubled year-over-year and grew by a significant double-digit percentage sequentially. Third-gen
EPYC processors continue ramping faster than the prior generation and contributed the majority of our
server CPU revenue in the quarter.

In cloud, multiple hyperscalers expanded their third-gen epic processor deployments to power their
internal workloads. And both Microsoft Azure and Google announced multiple new AMD-powered
instances. Cloudflare, Vimeo and Netflix also all recently announced new deployments powered by EPYC
processors, with Netflix highlighting how they doubled their streaming throughput per server while also
reducing their TCO.

Enterprise growth was particularly strong in the quarter as the more than 100 third-gen EPYC processor
platforms from Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, Cisco and others ramp into broader end customer
deployments. We expanded our wins in the quarter with Fortune 1000 financial services, automotive and
aerospace companies and see significant ongoing growth opportunities as our enterprise server pipeline
has more than doubled year-over-year.

In supercomputing, we won multiple installations in the quarter, highlighted by Argonne National
Laboratory selecting third-gen EPYC processors to power the new Polaris supercomputer that will be
used to test and optimize software in preparation for future exascale class systems. Overall, we are very
pleased with the momentum we have built in our data center business as server CPU and GPU revenue
grew to a mid-20s percent of overall revenue in the quarter.

Turning to our Xilinx acquisition. We are making good progress towards securing the required regulatory
approvals and remain on track to close by the end of the year. The Xilinx acquisition provides significant
benefits to AMD, including expanding our product portfolio with leadership adaptive computing and AI

solutions and further diversifying our customer base into complementary markets, including wired and
wireless communications, industrial and automotive.

In closing, our record third quarter results and the significant acceleration of our business in 2021
demonstrate that we have the right products and strategies to drive best-in-class growth and significant
shareholder returns. We continue growing faster than the market, driven by our consistent execution
and the investments we have made to build leadership products. Our supply chain team has executed
extremely well in a challenging environment, delivering incremental supply throughout the year,
supporting our strong revenue growth. We are also investing significantly to secure additional capacity to
support our long-term growth. Our product portfolio and road maps have never been stronger, and I look
forward to sharing more details about our next-generation server CPUs and GPUs at our Accelerated Data
Center Premiere on November 8.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial
performance. Devinder?

Devinder Kumar
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. AMD had another excellent quarter. Our leadership
products and growing data center momentum are driving record revenue, record profitability and
significant cash flow generation. Third quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 54% from a year ago, driven
by strong revenue increases across all businesses and up 12% from the prior quarter.

Gross margin was 48%, up 440 basis points from a year ago, driven by strong revenue mix and
competitive products. Operating expenses were $1.04 billion compared to $706 million a year ago as we
continue to invest in our long-term product road maps and scaling our business.

Operating income more than doubled to $1.06 billion, up $530 million from a year ago, driven primarily by
revenue growth. Operating margin was 24%, up from 19% a year ago. Net income grew to $893 million,
up $392 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $0.73 compared to $0.41 per share a
year ago. This includes a 15% effective tax rate compared to 3% a year ago.

Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.4 billion,
up 44% year-over-year, driven by significantly higher client and graphics processor revenue. Computing
and Graphics segment operating income was $513 million or 21% of revenue compared to $384 million
or 23% a year ago. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, which more
than offset higher operating expenses. Operating margin was slightly lower year-over-year, primarily due
to investments in R&D and go-to-market.

Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $1.9 billion, up 69% from $1.1 billion
the prior year. The strong revenue increase was primarily driven by significantly higher EPYC processor
and semi-custom sales. EESC operating income was up significantly at $542 million or 28% of revenue
compared to $141 million or 12% a year ago. Operating income growth was primarily driven by higher
revenue and richer product mix, partially offset by higher R&D and go-to-market expenses.

Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion. We
utilized $750 million to repurchase more than 7 million shares of common stock in the third quarter of
2021 as part of our ongoing stock repurchase program. Free cash flow was $764 million compared to $265
million in the same quarter last year and $888 million in the prior quarter.

On a quarter-over-quarter basis, free cash flow was lower as we made strategic investments in long-term
supply chain capacity to support future revenue growth. Inventory was $1.9 billion, up $137 million from
the prior quarter in support of continued revenue growth.

Let me now turn to the fourth quarter outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and
contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals. We expect revenue to
be approximately $4.5 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 39% year-over-
year and approximately 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth

across all businesses. The quarter-over-quarter increase is expected to be driven by higher server and
semi-custom sales.

In addition, for Q4 2021, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 49.5%; non-GAAP
operating expenses to be approximately $1.15 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be
approximately $170 million; and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.22 billion shares. For the
full year 2021, we now expect revenue to increase approximately 65% over 2020, driven by growth across
all businesses, up from the prior guidance of 60%. In addition, we continue to expect gross margin to be
approximately 48% for the full year.

In closing, we delivered another outstanding quarter with very strong year-over-year revenue growth,
significant financial momentum and record profitability. Our leadership products position us well to drive
future growth, significant cash generation and strong shareholder returns.

With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?

Laura A. Graves
Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.

Blayne Peter Curtis
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Great results. Just kind of curious, the overall outlook for Q4. So computing graphics being down. I was
just curious if that was more the supply. You're still growing sequentially. And obviously, I would assume
you prioritize servers. Just kind of curious what you're seeing in the computing graphics market. And is
it anything related to supply constraints for you that would be down sequentially or maybe downstream
constraints.

And then maybe for Devinder. Just curious, you're still growing gross margin. I'm assuming embedded,
semi-custom and service kind of offsetting. So just kind of walk us through the nice increase in gross
margin for Q4.

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. Sure, Blayne. Thanks for the question. So as it relates to the fourth quarter and where we are. Look,
we're overall very pleased with our performance in terms of the second half of the year. It's playing out
about what we expect it to be in the PC market. So as you're asking about computing and graphics.
We had seen that the PC market and user demand is strong overall, but there are some matched set
constraints in the PC market. And so for that reason, we've called the PC market really flattish. I would not
have said down. I would have called it flattish as we look into the fourth quarter.

However, as we look overall at the business, I think the data center business has performed very well, and
we see strong demand there, and we're continuing to see that. And as well, the console business, overall
gaming is also quite strong. And so we see growth in servers and semi-custom as we go into the fourth
quarter.

And then on the margin dynamics, Devinder, do you want to cover that?

Devinder Kumar
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

For Q4?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes.

Devinder Kumar
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So Q4, it is up slightly based from our guidance, 1 point from Q3, and that's really product mix,
higher margin from server, offset by semi-custom revenue also been higher going from Q3 to Q4. So we're
very pleased with the progress on the gross margin. As you look at the Q3 results, up 440 basis points
from last year, up 80 basis points from last quarter and the progression into Q4, obviously driven by the
server, our revenue growing. I'm very pleased with that also.

Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.

BofA Securities, Research Division

Congratulations on the strong results and the consistent execution. Lisa, how are you feeling about the
spending environment in the data center as you look over the next several quarters? And especially your
server road map versus the competition because they are planning to launch several new and important
products early next year. So I was just wondering how you're thinking about the competitive landscape
and the spending landscape over the next year.

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. So thanks, Vivek, for the question. I think overall, we're feeling very, very good about the server
business or the data center market. I think from a market standpoint, we've seen a strong market year
in 2021 in both cloud and enterprise and we see that continuing into 2022. I think from a competitive
position standpoint, I think Milan is extremely well positioned. So we were very pleased with sort of the
adoption rate of Milan. We said that we expected it to grow faster than Rome, and it has. And so the
crossover with Milan and Rome in the third quarter is an important metric for that.

Going into the fourth quarter, we continue to see a strong environment. And then as the competitive
environment goes into 2022, we always expect the competition to be strong, but our focus has been
consistent execution of our road map, and we feel very good about Zen 4 and Genoa in 2022. I think we
feel very good about the competitive positioning there. And we continue to believe that data center is the
most strategic part of our business, and we're making good progress with our customers and partners.

Vivek Arya
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And for my follow-up, Lisa, AMD has done very well in terms of gaining share at the hyperscalers.
Where are you in that journey? Is there still a lot of share gains to be had at hyperscalers? And
importantly, can you repeat that in the enterprise? Or do you think your competitors' incumbency limits
the share gain opportunity in the enterprise?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. So Vivek, what I would say there is, our business has been more cloud weighted with the
hyperscalers than enterprise, that continued here in the third quarter. I do believe that there is significant
additional opportunity for us in the cloud. So as we work with these partners, it is about sort of expansion
of workloads. Really, there's more tailoring of workloads as well as we go forward. And then there's also
just more customers and broader penetration in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 cloud guys. So I think that's a good
market for us.

On the enterprise side, I would say, we saw a very strong enterprise quarter here in the third quarter. I
think the strength of Milan with our OEMs in terms of the breadth of the platforms, is very good, and we're
seeing a good traction with sort of Fortune 1000 companies.

So I would say, overall, I think we see a growth trajectory for both our cloud and enterprise business. I
think in the enterprise, the key thing has been to get more familiarity with EPYC, and we've made very
good progress there. And so I feel very good about where that's going.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen.

Matthew D. Ramsay
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Obviously, Lisa has some really strong progress with data center crossing, I guess, 1/4 of the business
here with the results. I did want to ask a question specifically on your server business in China. Your
competitor called out China and some of the turmoil that's gone over there as a reason why some of their

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

cloud business had some headwinds in the third quarter. And maybe you could comment on how you see
spending over the last quarter and then in the next couple of quarters, specifically in that end market in
China. And then I have a follow-up.

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure, Matt. So again, what I would say is our data center business performed very well in the third
quarter, that was across both cloud and enterprise. And in cloud, that was across geographies. So we
haven't seen anything particular as it relates to China or there. What I would say is we continue to work
with the breadth of customers. And we're in the process of really rolling out sort of broader adoption
across the customer set. So I think we saw a pretty normal environment for demand.

Matthew D. Ramsay
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

As my follow-up, kind of unrelated. You guys mentioned in the comments, still plans to get the Xilinx deal
closed by the end of the year. And I think that's important as then there's a lot of things that you can talk
about more, maybe more openly about the heterogeneous compute strategy for the business over the
long term. Lisa, maybe you could walk us through to the extent that you can talk about it, obviously, there
are some things that you can't talk about.

But to the extent you can, what milestones you've achieved behind the scenes that make you feel
confident and what hurdles are still there to have the confidence? I mean I guess we've got weeks till we
get into the month of December and things kind of slow down a little bit regulatory-wise. So I just wonder
what gives the confidence that we can get there and what we should expect?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure, Matt. So look, we've been working diligently on the closure of the Xilinx acquisition. I would say
we're through the vast majority of what we need to do in the regulatory front. We're finishing up here.
And there's very good progress on the integration side. So we've done a lot on the integration. I think
we're excited with the plans that we have. And then on the regulatory front, again, as I said in the
prepared remarks, we've made good progress, and we believe we're on track to close at the end of the
year.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Congrats on the strong results. Lisa, I had 2 questions as well. First, on your outlook for 2022. I realize
it's early, and I certainly don't expect you guys to provide a point estimate. But I think people are kind of
concerned that you've been sort of overgrowing, if you will, relative to your long-term growth rate. You
grew 45% last year. You're on track to grow 65% this year, given your long-term through-cycle growth
target of 20%. Again, there is concern that you could decelerate going into next year, given PC dynamics
and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth.

So again, I don't expect you to give any quantification of next year, but if you could describe the year
qualitatively, what are the potential pluses and minuses at this point, that would be super helpful? And
then I've got a quick follow-up.

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. So look, as you said, it's a little bit early to talk about quantitatively. I'll cite qualitatively, what we
see is, look, we see a positive demand environment. And that's a market statement, but that's also an

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

AMD statement, right? I think the strength of our product portfolio has multiple growth vectors. Data
center continues to be a very important one for us. I think we're -- we continue to make progress in the
graphics market, and we think graphics is a good growth vector. Our console business, we would expect
would be -- I mentioned earlier that it'd be up in the fourth quarter, and we would expect it to be up in
2022, just given the strength of the demand environment there.

And so on the PC side, the comments I'll make on the PC side are -- the end user demand appears to be
strong. So there's a good amount of refresh going on, whether you're talking about consumer and your
high-end consumer or commercial or gaming. There are some supply constraints around matched sets
that we believe will continue into the first half of the year. That being the case, what we're using from a
planning assumption standpoint, is that the PC market may be flattish as we go from 2021 into 2022. But
even within that environment, we think there are opportunities for us to continue to grow.

So overall, I think we're very focused on execution, very focused on working with our customers to make
sure that we're aligned with what they need and overall feel very good about our product portfolio going
into 2022.

Toshiya Hari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's super helpful. And then as my quick follow-up, a similar question on gross margins. I'm not
sure if this is for Lisa or Devinder. You're guiding Q4 to 49.5%, which is obviously significant progress from
a year ago. Given some of the dynamics you've talked about whether it be the growth potential in server
CPU, the mix within server CPU, and I'm sure the mix dynamics on the client side, I think most of us do
expect a pretty nice positive trajectory into 2022, potentially with a five handle in terms of, again, gross
margins.

But any risks or any headwinds that we should be aware of? I think your foundry partner is raising pricing.
There is cost inflation generally across the board, but any risk items that we should think about at this
point?

Devinder Kumar
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I wouldn't say it, but I think is about managing the situation. As Lisa said, with the growth factors that we
have, we expect to continue making progress from where we are currently and especially predicated on
the competitive leadership products we have. We're very pleased with the progress we've made over the
last few years. But without getting to specifics, I think you can assume that we continue to make progress
with the mix of revenue, mix of products and the competitive products that we are introducing also into
2022.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

My first one, I wanted to ask about data center GPU. I know you said it more than doubled. But can you
give us an approximate feeling for how big that is it? Are we still talking like tens of millions of dollars? Or
is it larger than that? And what are your expectations for how that's going to ramp as Frontier and some
of the other supercomputers that a lot of that stuff is going into our ramping over the next like couple of
years?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure. So Stacy, on the data center GPU side, the third quarter was a larger quarter for the data center
GPU. This is where we shipped the Frontier shipments that are now in the build cycle. It is still a relatively
small business compared to the CPU side. So our expectation is that going into the fourth quarter, it's

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

11

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

a lumpy business for us. So Q3 was a strong quarter given the shipments of -- for Frontier. We would
expect, as we go into the fourth quarter, that it will be down sequentially quarter-on-quarter. But still, it's
a strong growth year overall for a business that we think is a significant strategic growth driver for us over
the next few years.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Got it. For my follow-up, I just wanted to ask about Q4. So obviously, you would sort of give an implied
guidance for Q4 last quarter. The guidance now is obviously decently higher. Can you just talk a little bit
about what is driving that upside relative to where your expectations were last quarter?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Devinder, you want to talk about that? Or...

On the revenue, I think -- go ahead.

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

I'm sorry, were you asking about revenue or margin, Stacy?

Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

Well, both, if you're willing to answer both, both.

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Okay. All right. Let me start and then let -- I want to make sure I answer your question. How's that? So
look, on the revenue side, when we look at the sequential growth, we have been able -- look, the supply
chain, this is about really supply chain optimization.

And we have been able to secure some additional supply, given some of the work that we've been doing.
And we see strong demand across the board. But sequentially, what we're guiding to is stronger server
demand as well as gaming, and gaming includes the semi-custom game consoles, as well as our graphics
business is doing quite well as well.

And then in terms of the sequential margin, it's similar. I mean we're having servers, some improved mix
and graphics driving upside. And that's partially offset by the consoles which are below corporate average.
But net-net, I think it's a positive sequential both on revenue and margin.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I guess what I'm asking is, for example, are your expectations for servers into Q4 now higher than they
were 3 months ago when you gave implied guidance for Q4?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. Yes, it is.

Joseph Lawrence Moore
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I'm wondering if you could talk about graphics a little bit. It seems like that's the business that's probably
struggled the most to get silicon and you've shown some pretty nice growth there. What's the prognosis
for that business going forward? And in the past, you've said you're comfortable that there's relatively low
cryptocurrency exposure there. Is that still the case?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. Sure, Joe. Look, the graphics business did have a strong third quarter. I think that's true for graphics
gaming as well as data center GPU. I think the portfolio that we have there with RDNA 2 has turned
out really well. So we're pleased with how it's positioned competitively in the marketplace. And overall,
gaming has been a secular trend that has continued with very strong demand.

In terms of crypto, our view is that it's really negligible revenue for us in the third quarter. It's not a
segment that we have been servicing. We've tried very much to try to keep our gaming graphics focused
on gamers. And we were able to increase some of the supply for graphics, and that's one of the reasons
that we saw the sequential growth that we saw. And going into the fourth quarter next year, again, I think
we see gaming overall as a strong segment for us, and the product set is very good. So we feel good
about it.

Operator

Our next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I have 2 quick questions, if I can as well. Just kind of sticking on the expectations in the next year,
appreciating that you're not going to give a full guide. I'm just curious how we should think about the
semi-custom business given how sizable that's been to the overall growth in 2021. Any framing of how
you expect 2022 to shape up at this point?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure, Aaron. So again, if you look at the overall growth that we had in 2021, I would say it was actually
quite balanced across all of our businesses. The semi-custom business was in the second year of ramp,
and demand has exceeded supply. We've been able to ramp that as we've gone through the year.

As we look into 2022, the historical view of game consoles has been year 4 is the peak, at least that's
what it was in the last generation. What we expect in this generation is, again, very strong demand going
into 2022. So we would expect it to grow into 2022, which would be the third year of the cycle, and then
we'll see what happens after that. But overall, I think our view is we have a very balanced business with
multiple growth drivers across data center, PCs, graphics as well as consoles.

Aaron Christopher Rakers
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

That's very helpful. And then the follow-up question is on your own supply chain side. I know in the
prepared comments you said working on securing adequate supply given your growth trajectory. Are you
currently able to meet on the goal of the demand that you currently see? And can you give any color of
what -- how we should think about the supply situation on your end?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. So I mean we've been working on ramping the supply chain really for more than a year. If you think
about sort of dynamics here. What I'd like to say is, overall, the demand has been very, very high. So the

fact that we can grow revenue this year 65% year-on-year, I think, is a testament to the supply chain
work. I think if we had more supply, we could certainly ship more.

That being the case, I think we're prioritizing in the most strategic segments. And we have invested
significantly in capacity for additional capabilities, and we'll see some of that come online as we go
through 2022. And we're going to continue to be aggressive to secure additional capacity because we
believe our product portfolio will enable that growth.

Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulations, Lisa. Lisa, my first question is back on the supply side of things. I'm just wondering if you
can help me better understand, was it more of an issue in your PC business or your server business? And
I guess, especially as we look into next year, as supply begins to loosen up, this year, given how tight the
overall ecosystem was, competing on price didn't make a lot of sense.

As supply begins to accelerate across the ecosystem, how are you thinking about pricing, especially in lieu
of your large competitor kind of resetting their gross margins for next year? In your view, does that give
them more wiggle room? Or do you think that they're being pretty benign on the pricing side of things on
that gross margin reset?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. So maybe let me -- there's a lot of various aspects to that, John. So let me try to take it in pieces.
As it relates to current supply, I want to make sure that we're clear. I mean we have brought on a
tremendous amount of additional supply, and that's part of the reason that we overachieved the Q3 results
and then we guided higher in Q4. So I do think that we have done a lot of work on our supply chain.

In the PC market, in particular, I think the market is not necessarily constrained on CPUs, but more
constrained on matched sets. And so we're trying to ensure that we're not building inventory in the
channel. And that's part of the optimization that we do is to ensure that as we ship sell-in processors that
we see matched sets to sell through. And so from that standpoint, we think inventory is very healthy at
the OEMs, and that's an important factor as we go into 2022.

As it relates to what happens with the pricing environment as supply eases up. I think, right now, what
we see is a -- again, it's an environment where most people are prioritizing supply. As we go into 2022,
though, I think this is all about the product. And what we view is -- our focus in sort of our product line
has been moving up the stack, ensuring that we're providing significant value to our customers in terms of
total cost of ownership on the server side and innovative features and capabilities on the PC side and the
graphics side. And we're going to continue to do that.

I mean we're excited about our product portfolio into 2022. We're going to continue to be very aggressive
on the overall road map. And with that, I think our game plan is exactly what it was, what it always has
been, which is lean into the product cycle, and the deep customer relationships and continue to build that
out over time.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, Devinder, you did a good job kind of explaining the year-over-
year changes in operating margins in the compute and graphics business. I'm wondering if you could talk
a little bit about sequentially what happened. Revenue was up and op margins were down a little bit. Is
that just the influence of the very strong growth in GPUs going into the data center? Because it sounds like
in the core compute business mix probably got better sequentially for you. So I'm just trying to make sure
I understand all the dynamics you play.

Devinder Kumar
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. If you're talking about the CG segment, it's investments, right? Some investments in R&D and go
to market. And also, we have a lot of new products coming into 2022, and there's expenditure involved
ahead of the curve before you introduce the products in the next year. And that's really what happened in
the transition quarter-over-quarter.

Our next question today is coming from Chris Caso from Raymond James.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

First question is about the supply constraints and how that affects seasonality as we go into the beginning
of next year. And obviously, you're making efforts to bring on more supply. You spoke about in PC these
constraints with regard to matched sets. I'm sure at this point, you don't want to provide guidance for Q1,
but how should we be thinking about seasonality for Q1 as we contemplate these supply constraints?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes, Chris, I think it's a little bit early to talk about Q1. I mean I think -- let's see what would we say
about seasonality. I don't have a lot to say other than typically, Q1 is down from Q4. That's typically what
the pattern is, given the consumer-related businesses. It might be a little bit subseasonal as we go into
this first quarter just given the demand environment, but we'll have to see how things play out over the
next couple of months.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

All right. A little bit of a bigger picture question for my second question. And we've heard and seen from
some of the hyperscalers is a trend of, in some cases, doing some custom designs, doing it on their own,
often with ARM-based designs. Do you consider that an opportunity or a threat for AMD? And to what
extent are you engaged with some of those hyperscalers on some of these custom designs because you do
have an IP portfolio yourself?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. Chris, on that, we definitely view it as an opportunity, right? So I think what's happening in the
data center market is that as the need for compute gets larger, sort of this tailoring of compute for the
various workloads is an important trend. I think our IP portfolio today is very strong. I think it will even be
stronger given some of the things that we have in plan to allow more tailoring. And we are working very
closely with a number of hyperscalers on sort of the vision of compute over the next few years and how
we might put together some different solutions between our CPU, GPU, interconnect capability and then
with the addition of Xilinx as well coming into our portfolio. So lots of opportunity there for customization.
I think that's a key trend that we're certainly going to lean into.

Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Let me ask a question echoed with a congrats of other people on the strong results. Lisa, I just wanted to
ask about the comparison on your CNG side between the C and the G and specifically on the client graphic
side of things. Clearly, this year has been a really strong year for AMD. Can you just talk about the go-
forward on the client side in that?

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 26, 2021

I think we're all pretty well aware of what's going to happen in the data center GPU side. But how do we
reconcile your commentary on where you think the PC market would be in the flattish area versus the
strength you've had in GPUs this year in a strong GPU market? Do you think that continues next year?
How much of it is AMD specific? Or if the PC market is weaker, is that something that's a little bit of a
headwind for AMD?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. So again, what I would say is our market share is still, I would say, underrepresented, whether you're
talking about the client sort of CPU or APU side or the GPU side. I think what we have seen here in the
third quarter and then into the second half of the year is our graphics business has performed quite well.
It is channel driven in the sense that there's still strong demand amongst gamers for GPUs.

As we go into 2022, though, I don't view sort of the PC market as a headwind for the company. I think as
we look at all of these markets, of course, we do a bunch of scenario planning if the market is up or if it's
down. I think there are many who think that the market may be up.

There are some who think that market may be down. And that's why we're choosing to model sort of the
base case is flattish. But even within that market, whether you're talking about client CPUs or -- client
GPUs, we think we have opportunities to gain share and grow in that business, just given the strength of
our product portfolio and the fact that we are sort of underrepresented to we think the -- sort of what we
can expect given those products.

Ross Clark Seymore
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

And I guess as my follow-up, just one for Devinder on the OpEx side, and I'll give the same disclaimer
that I know you're not going to give any specifics about next year, but you guys have done a great job of
lowering your OpEx intensity throughout this year. I think you're going to be closer to 24% versus your
26% to 27% entering the year and 25% as of last quarter.

So great expansion there in margins and better leverage. As we look forward, though, I think the third
quarter was the first time where you guys spent enough that it actually impacted a segment where the
operating margin fell a little bit. And I think we all understand why you're doing that and it feeds great
growth. So it's not a negative.

But as I look into '22, do you think next year can be another year where your operating leverage is
positive? Or do you expect to be able to spend closer to your former targets in kind of the 25% to 27% of
sales range?

Devinder Kumar
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

I think, fundamentally, and what you observe is right, very disciplined from an OpEx standpoint, investing
in the growth is important. Many of the things that Lisa talked about earlier is all about growth in many
different vectors. And obviously, that requires funding from an OpEx standpoint, whether it's R&D, go-to-
market, hiring, which we are doing from a viewpoint of the growth in the company.

And I think from a modeling standpoint, a guidance standpoint, you can assume that the growth in OpEx
will be lower in revenue. Margin continues to expand, OpEx flattish or even down. I mean you can model
it, but very disciplined on that standpoint and making sure that we are investing for the growth is a top
priority for us.

I had 2. I guess, first, Lisa, no one has asked about software yet. I was wondering if you can update us on
your software efforts. And maybe as you get close to closing Xilinx, how much that sort of changes things
for you on the software side and maybe how your search for software talent has been? And then I had a
follow-up.

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Sure, Tim. So yes, we continue to invest heavily in software, particularly on the data center GPU side. We
-- with our next-generation GPU architecture, MI200, which we'll be talking a little bit about in the next
few weeks, we have made significant investments in progress. Our focus has been on using sort of the
Frontier beachhead with high-performance computing and expanding that into AI and working with our
partners on that software development. So overall, continue to make good progress there. I think the
Xilinx acquisition and bringing in sort of that software talent also provides opportunities to optimize across
the overall portfolio in terms of just the software infrastructure that people want in an overall ecosystem.
So very strategic area that we're making good progress in.

Timothy Michael Arcuri
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And I guess just last question for me. So server share, if I look at your guidance for Q4, it looks like you're
going to be in the 12.5% to 13% share, if I use the entire TAM, and that's up like 500 basis points versus
last year Q4. So I guess the question is, like, is that a reasonable trajectory into next year? As if we're
sitting to 12 months from now, would you be surprised if you gained another 500 basis points next year?
And sort of where do you think about where that share can go?

Lisa T. Su
President, CEO & Non-Independent Director

Yes. So I think, overall, our server trajectory has been very strong. I mean I think we're very pleased with
the trajectory here in 2021. I think having a number of quarters where we're doubling the revenue year-
on-year kind of speaks to the progress there. As we go into 2022, we still believe we are a share gainer
in that environment just given the strength of our portfolio and let's call it, platforms that are still yet to
launch across our customer set.

So we're continuing to play out the strategy of a data center being a place where our technology is very
differentiated. And we think that's true in the third generation with EPYC, and we certainly are very
focused on ensuring that the next generation with Zen 4 and Genoa are similarly well positioned in the
marketplace.
