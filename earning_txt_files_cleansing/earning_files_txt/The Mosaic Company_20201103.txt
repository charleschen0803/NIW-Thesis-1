THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Mosaic Company's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings
Fireside Chat. [Operator Instructions]

Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms.
Gagnon, you may begin.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke,
President and Chief Executive Officer; Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and
Rick McLellan, Senior Vice President, Commercial.

We will host a prepared question-and-answer session addressing the questions received last night followed
by a short live Q&A session, time permitting. All of our earnings materials released yesterday after market
close are available on our website at mosaicco.com.

We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are
not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's
beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday
and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our third quarter press release and
performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday's Form 8-K filing as well as our commentary on the
quarter posted to our website also contain information important on these non-GAAP measures.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thanks for joining us today for our quarter 3 2020 question-and-answer session.

Before we get started, I would like to emphasize our key points from our quarterly earnings report. First,
we are realizing the benefits of our extensive cost transformation work. Gross margin for the quarter was
up 27% compared with a year ago despite essentially flat fertilizer prices.

Secondly, agriculture and fertilizer markets around the globe are strong and improving. Phosphate prices
are up substantially, while potash prices are stable. We expect global supply and demand to remain tight
in all of 2021.

And third, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. We have repaid all the short-term debt we borrowed
to be prepared for COVID impacts and the business is generating substantial cash.
Now we'll get to your questions. Laura?

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Question and Answer

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, I'm going to try to go through the most frequently asked questions fairly rapidly to allow time for
follow-up questions after. The largest number of questions we received last night related to phosphates
markets and the countervailing duty petition. P.J. Juvekar from Citi, Joel Jackson from BMO, and Adam
Samuelson from Goldman Sachs are all asking about the impact of trade flow shifts.

How much premium has been built into the U.S. phosphate prices from the absence of Moroccan and
Russian imports? And how will a reduction in the NOLA global parity premium affect your margins? In
other words, what would the $50 price increase you expect to realize in the fourth quarter be if the U.S.
was at parity today?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, gentlemen.

Prices are up globally. Our realizations reflect India prices up over 20% and Brazil prices up 30% despite
increasing imports in both those jurisdictions from Morocco and Russia. While global parity may be less
than where NOLA is trading today, it would be significantly higher than where it was trading in June.

Now there seems to be an increasing common misconception that somehow the CVD petition is impacting
global supply. Market prices are driven by strong supply and demand, not the CVD, which is expected to
trade -- change trade flows not to overall market. Our petition was aimed at leveling the playing field for
all producers selling in the U.S., not to eliminate competition. Moroccan and Russian producers chose to
pull back completely from the U.S. market, likely leaving their customers short of product. And they did it
to make a political point and express their dissatisfaction over this being considered at all.

We are doing all we can to best serve our customers. We have even begun importing tonnes from Ma'aden
simply to meet our customers' needs. Longer term, it is not our intention to replace Moroccan and
Russian tonnes with products from Saudi for several reasons, not least of which is from a global logistics
perspective. It makes more sense for us to send that product into Asia rather than bring it here, but we're
doing that to help our customers.

Longer term, we would expect NOLA to trade at global parity, recognize that global parity prices today are
significantly above where they were in June.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Another trade pool question comes from P.J. If exports from Morocco and Russia are ending up in India
and Brazil, why are prices up there?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

The global supply and demand is stronger than many realized a few months ago. Economic tightness in
the market is driving global prices up. Supply has tightened. China exports are down. And we started 2020
with curtailments, including COVID-driven outages.

On the demand side, the agricultural economy globally is strong. Food security has become a great priority
around the world. And fertilizers are very affordable.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

We have a question from Ben Isaacson from Scotia and John Roberts from UBS. They're both asking
about phosphate pricing momentum. September realized prices improved 11% from August. Did that
momentum continue? And how much more upside do you see for the phosphate market?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

We've continued to see prices increase into October and November. And seeing good demand as we move
into 2021, we expect to end this fall with very low inventories, which bodes well for the spring season
and winter fill. We are seeing a normal seasonal slowdown, but we expect strong markets to continue into
2021. And as we mentioned in our written remarks, we expect prices in the fourth quarter to be up $50
per tonne over the third quarter.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, both Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse and Joel Jackson of BMO and others are asking for potential
impacts following the ITC DOC determinations. In particular, how will no, low and high duties impact our
strategy? And who will fill the void if U.S. imports?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Remember, the November determination is simply if there are subsidies. In the first quarter, the decision is
the determination of harm and the identification of duty, if anything.

If it is determined that there is going to be a high duty, we would expect the trade flows to change to
account for that. As such, we would expect the Russians and the Moroccans to continue to ship to other
markets like India and Brazil.

If there is no subsidy, we would expect the trade flows to return to what they were pre-CVD filing.
Remember, the Russians and the Moroccans made the decision to pull out of these markets altogether
when petition was filed.

So we will continue to serve our customers. If there is more product required for Brazil and India, we will
redirect tonnes to those markets. If we continue to see a deficiency in the North American market, we will
divert tonnes to that market.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we've received a number of questions related to the broader phosphate market supply and demand,
in particular with respect to the Chinese phosphate industry. P.J. Juvekar from Citi asks, what are your
estimates of phosphate exports out of China in 2020?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

We've said and we continue to believe that Chinese exports will be down by more than 500,000 tonnes
this year. Our latest estimate is that they will actually be down by more like 700,000 tonnes. From January
to September, exports were down by nearly 1 million tonnes.

Now it's important to remember that DAP MAP production in China continues to trend lower. Quarter 1 to
quarter 3, it was down by about 1.4 million tonnes, while domestic demand now appears to be stabilizing.
That means Chinese exports are going to be constrained in the future.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Jonas Oxgaard asked, how confident are you that the 3 facilities closed in China are permanently closed?

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

For the 3 facilities closed in 2019, we are confident they are not coming back to DAP MAP production. One
was permanently closed, one was in the process of relocation to a different place and is planned to be
built as a water-soluble fertilizer production facility and the third shifted its production to industrial-grade
purified phosphoric acid. Purified phosphoric acid from the wet process is replacing the highly-polluting
thermal process, which is also the outcome of the stringent environmental protection measurements and
is ongoing.

According to China Phosphate Industry Association, 5 million tonnes of DAP MAP production capacity has
been lost since the environmental protection measures have been implemented. This includes permanent
closure, relocation for different production and strategic production shifts to higher-value products like
purified phosphoric acid.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, in a related question, Chris Parkinson would also like an update on the projections for Chinese
production costs.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

The estimation to a typical southwest phosphate producer's production cost is still around $300 per metric
tonne, ex-plant, and probably an FOB equivalent of $335 per metric tonne at a Chinese export port.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, the second most popular area of questions was Mosaic Fertilizantes. Mark Connelly specifically
addressed this question to you.

After you acquired Fertilizantes, you told us that there were no really big cost reduction projects, but
rather a large number of small to midsized projects, many of which were suggested by local employees.
Are the sort of projects you are doing today materially different in expected returns? And among these,
has the transfer of best practices between and among your Brazil plants proceeded as well as the early
projects did?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Let me say, we continue to see a number of small to medium-sized, high-benefit projects, and
transformation continues to drive benefits with very little capital and very high returns for Mosaic
Fertilizantes. Now as we go forward, some of these will require incremental growth capital, mostly
technology-related, and much of that is like our next-gen mining investment in Florida.

Now what I would ask is we're going to go into depth of this and our transformation growth objectives for
Mosaic Fertilizantes next Monday, November 9. So please stay tuned then and we'll give you a lot more
detail of where we believe this business is going and the potential for our growth in South America.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs and Andrew Wong from RBC both asked about the demand
outlook.

How does the interplay of current farmer economics and La Niña weather forecasts impact the Brazilian
demand outlook? And did the very high Q3 phosphates demand pull volumes from Q4?

James C. O’Rourke

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

CEO, President & Director

Look, current farmer economics are very strong, particularly in Brazil, and are expected to push Brazilian
demand grow higher again in 2021, probably in the 2% to 3% year-over-year. This is the fundamental
driver.

As for La Niña, it's not something that we're overly concerned with, unless it were persistent through
mid-2021. The reason for this is the strong growth signals from La Niña for Argentina and Southern Brazil
is typical from June to August. And what we saw in recent months could have been a signal persisting a bit
longer than is typical or it may have been simply dry weather patterns in South Americas at large.

Importantly for Brazil, though, rains have improved and planting is progressing. The delays were only
a couple of weeks, so we do expect to see no impact on total demand. Demand is expected to main --
remain very strong, aligned with good farmer profitability.

In terms of your question of moving Q3 phosphates from Q4, we do expect to see continued strong
demand in Q4 as the season has been extended by the dry weather that we've already seen.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, Steve Byrne of Bank of America asks, there has been significant productivity extracted from the
legacy Vale assets. Are the earnings growth drivers longer-term going to be from geographic expansion,
from production capacity expansions in phosphate and potash or from new products and services such as
selling other crop inputs?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. The quick answer is yes. We see great potential in all 3 of those areas. We are and have a very
strong first-mover advantage. We have a great platform in Brazil. And we hope, over time, to take greater
advantage of that.

Now today, our primary focus for growth in Mosaic Fertilizantes is organic. We continue to see
transformation opportunity. We see increases in co-product sales and benefits from the deployment of
technology. There are geographic areas where we feel we have a smaller distribution footprint than we
would like, but we also have room to grow with our current distribution assets that we have.

So in summary, we see all areas having potential. We do think that both distribution and production will
grow. And we'll continue to strive our first-mover advantage in that great growing region.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joel Jackson from BMO is asking about Fertilizantes' per tonne margins. Should we expect these margins
to hold, expand or contract in 2021? And what are the main drivers of these?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

When we're thinking about our per tonne margins, we really have to consider 2 components. First,
production, where the price of finished goods, raw materials and cost to produce drive gross margins.
Here, we are continue driving production costs down and, through transformation, continuing to improve
that business.

In distribution, where we earn a margin that is impacted by volume, economy of scale and pricing trends,
we continue as well as transformation and continued improvements in our performance product sales.
That's really how we're going to drive long-term value. So in distribution, we do see that holding up well
as well as in production. So on both sides, we expect we cannot only hold those margins, but expand them
in -- as time goes by.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, we also got a large number of questions on our phosphate segment. Steve Byrne and P.J. Juvekar are
both asking about the near-term performance and the expected profitability improvement into the fourth
quarter.

What portion of the phosphate fourth quarter volumes are already locked in? And will this impact your
ability to realize the $50 per tonne price increase? So are we looking at a much better fourth quarter in
phosphates?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

As expected, a good portion of the tonnes we expect to recognize in the fourth quarter have already
been sold and priced. We don't expect our price realization increase to be below the $50 per tonne in
any scenario. We have assessed the impact on a potential announcement in CVD in November, and our
expectation is the impact will only be a minor change to late December shipments if that goes against us.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

P.J. Juvekar of Citi and Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs both asked about the ARO reserve increase.

Can you elaborate on the drivers for the ARO increase and the remediation liability? What is the timing of
the increased cash outlays?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

I'm going to hand this one straight over to Clint to answer. I think he has the details of our ARO that we
just booked.

Clint C. Freeland
Senior VP & CFO

As many of you may recall, the third quarter of each year is typically when we update and refresh the
estimate procedure work related to ARO activity. And I would say that quite a bit of the amount that we
booked this quarter is related to Plant City as we've learned more about that site over the last year.

Our ARO spend is typically spread out over an extended period of time, 40 to 50 years during the life of
facilities in Gypstacks and so forth, so a very extended type of spend profile. But also recall that against
our existing AROs, we also have about a $700 million escrow account that will offset at least a portion of
that spend in future years.

Now related to the environmental reserve that we've booked this quarter, that's really related to some
subsurface work that we need to do at some of our facilities around some of our Gypstacks. And I would
say, specific to that, that spend is probably going to be made over the next 2 to 4 years.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs and Seth Goldstein from Morningstar are both asking about fourth
quarter phosphate volumes.

Is it reasonable to expect a notable uptick in volumes? As we move into 2021, should we expect higher
year-over-year volumes or will you keep production lower to support higher prices?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

As we look at the fourth quarter, we see great demand in all our markets right now. And so with that, we
do expect to have relatively good sales through the quarter and then low inventories as we enter next
year.

As we look to 2021, we do expect to see a good demand scenario and we would expect to see good
utilization of our assets, particularly, if you remember, in first quarter of 2020, we had Bartow down for
almost 3 months. So now we expect that to come back and our facilities to run very much closer to full
production in 2021.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Joc, lastly, I'd like to end with a couple of questions on our potash segment. Ben Isaacson from Scotia
asks, how we think about Colonsay? And do we believe there may be a need for those tonnes in the
market in the future?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes, we definitely look at Colonsay as something we would bring back if our customers needed the tonnes
and if the price justified restarting it. This industry is ripe with examples of sudden but permanent supply
disruptions. And in that case, this tonnage could be very valuable to us. And as our customers' demand
grows, Colonsay will be significantly cheaper to bring back than any greenfield operation.

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

The last question comes from Seth Goldstein at Morningstar.

How much potash is coming out of K3 now? And how does that change as we move to 2022? Is the long-
term plan to grow K3 production in line with potash demand growth? Or will you try to increase market
share?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

In 2020, K3 is forecasted to produce about 4.4 million tonnes or the equivalent of about 1.5 million tonnes
of finished product, which amounts to about 15%, 20% of our total production of potash in Canada.

In June 2022, K3 ore at Esterhazy will be providing the ore for approximately 6 million tonnes of finished
good production. And this will completely replace K1 and K2 mines. So our expectation is we will not
necessarily grow production, but rather replace K1 and K2.

Longer term, our goal is to match production with demand, while also lowering our cost profile. K3 has
already proven to lower our overall costs.

Now with our remaining time, I'd like to open it up for follow-up questions from our audience.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America.

Steve Byrne
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I'd like to drill a little more on this phosphate supply and demand outlook that seems to be highly
contested today. So you have a fair amount of information in your deck on the demand outlook for '21,
somewhere between flat with 2020 or maybe up 2 million tonnes. But if we look at your supply outlook
and you have a breakdown of what you see as potentially the delta in supply from '21 to '20, there's a few
fairly large items in there and just we'd like to hear your view as to the up and downside risk to some of
those, the big ones being an inventory build is expected by the producers, the ramp-up at OCP and then

10

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

the recovery in supply given the 2020 outages. Those 3 are the -- they are the fairly large line items. Is
there a potential risk that those are much bigger than that?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Well, let me start by saying, as we look into 2021, we do believe that the phosphate S&D is quite tight.
So first of all, we'll end this year with relatively low inventories, and that's relatively low inventories
throughout the channel. Our proxy kind of indicates U.S. inventory will be down about 35%, which
represents somewhere in that 600,000 tonnes mark. India will be down as much as 1.3 million tonnes and
China down as much as 700,000 tonnes. So as we look at how we enter this year, we do believe that some
of the production will have to go into rebuilding distribution stocks to fully service this market.

And then if we look at the increases, there's a couple of things that are important. First of all, with that
level of inventory at the end of the year, we do expect that the -- will be a higher utilization of assets,
which is where we have the 1 million tonnes of recovered production, if you will.

So if we look at those 2, they relatively offset themselves that we need to increase inventory just to
supply basic needs and have a normally balanced market, but we also will have the opportunity to run
assets harder.

In terms of the go-forward, we've heard from OCP publicly that they will be relatively slower in bringing
on new production. They've announced that publicly. So we see modest increases to new productions
coming from improvements in Ma'aden as they continue to move their Wa'ad Al Shamal operation up to
full production over the next year or 2 and then modest increases from OCP. And I think the rest are fairly
minor in nature, so I wouldn't really worry too much about those one way or another. But overall, we do
see a tightening market for next year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein.

Jonas I. Oxgaard
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division

I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on the phosphate rock supply/demand as well. Basically, the
same analysis you did for phosphate supply/demand. What does it look like on the rock side?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Okay. We don't -- sorry. We don't really look at phosphate supply and demand, the rock supply and
demand for the reason that we're not really involved in that market. Overall, where we get -- where that
comes about is domestic production in some of the nonintegrated markets like India and whatnot.

In terms of our Miski Mayo operation, which we do have an outside production of rock, it's really for our
own use. So we don't, again, look at it from that perspective. We assume that really what matters is
overall phosphoric acid usage in the global market and that really drives us.

So when we talk about our DAP MAP, really, it breaks down to what is produced from that rock and what
we produce from our own rock. So we don't really look at it as a separate market.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse.

Quickly on the potash front. It appears, in certain markets, ex-China, are really beginning to turn
throughout Asia. And you and some of your peers seem confident in the rebound in the Chinese market as
well.

So just overall on your analysis heading into the next 2 years, of course, hitting on course grain, oilseed
and even F&V, what are your thoughts of potential upside coming from the Asian market? And then also if
you could hit on the potential optionality for biodiesel, that would be incredibly helpful as well.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Look, what we see today and I think what we saw through the year, is not unlike what we've talked
about previously, which is when the price in 2016 went low, we quickly saw a rebound in demand. And
we're seeing that this year as we predicted earlier in the year. So first of all, I would say there's been a
relative rebound in demand as was expected.

Some of the highlights, though, I would like to put out is, as you mentioned, China has been a really good
highlight as has India. In both of those markets, for reasons of food security and probably trying to make
sure that they produce as much in-country as they can, demand for potash has been strong in both of
those jurisdictions. And then in the rest of Asia, the big thing there, of course, is Indonesia, Malaysia and
the demand for palm oil, which has really bumped up.

And I -- and just to touch on your piece there, biodiesel has been a part of that because where -- biodiesel
is going to play a role in fuel as we go forward. And I would like to highlight that in markets like India and
China, basic ethanol will also play a role in demand for commodities in those jurisdictions as well.

So yes, we do look at these playing a role in demand increase over time. And we are expecting good
demand from Asia, India, China in the next year.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup.

Prashant N. Juvekar
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Potash volumes year-to-date are up 6%, while phosphates are up only 1%. What is the -- why is there a
difference?

And then secondly, if China ag markets are really robust, and I think that will continue into 2021, what are
your expectations from the country in terms of imports of potash and exports of phosphates?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Well, let me hit your first question first, P.J. The big difference, I think, between potash and
phosphate volumes in terms of deliveries has probably been, more than anything, just inventory moves.
If you remember, we had a very big buildup of inventory as we moved into this year in phosphates. And
for that reason, I think that was -- had to be consumed first and was consumed in the first quarter before
you really got into -- starting to get real demand or real demand pull from production. So I think that's
probably the reason for that.

In terms of -- sorry, I got to get the second question, Laura?

Laura C. Gagnon
Vice President of Investor Relations

Yes.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

P.J. -- can we ask P.J. to reask a second question? Sorry, operator, I...

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Here, hold it. Oh, I'm sorry, yes, phosphates. Sorry, the question, I think, from P.J. was Chinese imports of
potash and Chinese exports of phosphates next year.

And so, look, our expectation in China in potash, P.J., is that there's going to be continued focus, and we
see this in their 5-year plan in China, but there's continued focus on food security and ensuring that they
have a robust agricultural industry to ensure the less reliance on outside places. So for doing that, we
expect that actually potash demand will increase internally because the corn demand is so strong. But
also, the other one is their own internal production at Qinghai Lake is reaching its capacity and possibly
even going down. So we do expect China to be a, let's call it, a growth engine for next year.

In terms of phosphate exports, I think, as I said, there's a couple of closures. So there has been some
structural changes in the phosphate market in China. And that, coupled with what we believe is flat to
increasing Chinese consumption of phosphates, means that our expectation is Chinese exports will be
down, maybe not year-over-year because COVID had a big impact to the start of this year, but certainly
down from the 2019 levels.

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.

Adam L. Samuelson
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

It's Adam Samuelson. So the -- I guess there's been a lot of detail today on the phosphate kind of market
outlook and your own kind of expectations of your own performance in the market, yet, Joc, your stock is
down 15%. And so clearly, the market takes a -- is taking a different view. What do you think the market
is getting along today as it relates to your own kind of market outlook or the strategy or the operating
performance that -- where do you think the gaps in understanding is?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Well, I'm going to have to be fairly direct on this answer, Adam. And let me start by saying, I suspect the
market has been impacted by statements made by one of our competitors and their impairment of their
phosphate business. So let me be relatively direct with this.

First of all, an impairment needs to be driven by a triggering event, at least that's my understanding
of general accounting practices or IFRS. When I look at the potential triggering events, the one thing I
can say is that phosphate prices are up significantly quarter-over-quarter. And if I look at the outside
consultants that we use like CRU, their long-term estimates are also up. So it is very difficult for me to see
how long-term phosphate outlook was the triggering event for this write-down.

So as such, you asked me what I -- what we're getting wrong. I think people are taking the idea that the
triggering event was the phosphate market, where clearly it had to be something different than that. And
they're assuming that means we have a part -- a poor outlook.

Now what I will say is if you compare the 2 businesses, we are very difficult to compare them one-to-
one. First of all, we're very different in scale, but we also sell very different products. They sell purified
phosphoric acid, which is being highly impacted in the industrial sector by 2 things: One, the economy is
slowing down and the other by external competition. Now if I look -- compare that to fertilizers, fertilizers
is actually quite the opposite. We've seen an increase in demand, we've seen an increase in pricing and

we see a very good outlook. So I don't think you can compare the 2 businesses. And I certainly don't think
phosphate demand and supply, at least for fertilizers, is a factor in that.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets.

Andrew D. Wong
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

So I mean there's been a lot of discussion around the CVD impacts, and we've covered that a lot, but I do
want to ask another one. So like you said, it's mostly about the trade flows aren't really -- that's not really
what's driven the S&D. But in terms of like on Mosaic -- so Mosaic sells a lot of phosphate in both Brazil
and the U.S. And if anything, it seems like Brazil is getting up there in terms of volume. So I understand
that if the trade flows were reversed, maybe the U.S. premium comes down, but like what's the actual
impact on the company because then you would see less flows going to Brazil? I'd just be curious to hear
your thoughts on that.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Look, you're absolutely right. This is about trade flows, not overall supply and demand.

So today, what the Russians and the Moroccans have done is they have redirected tonnes that would have
otherwise come to the U.S. to either Brazil, India or, in some cases, Eastern Canada. So they have moved
a number of tonnes to different markets. They have not sold significantly different number of tonnes
globally than they have in any other year. So we know that their overall supply and demand balance
in the world has been very similar. So where they pull tonnes out of the U.S., we've had to bring more
tonnes into the U.S. to serve it, but you're also seeing tonnes come from places that haven't historically
sent tonnes to the U.S. like Australia and Mexico or significant tonnage in terms of that. So you do see a
difference in trade flows.

So what would happen if that reversed? My expectation is the reversal would create exactly the opposite.
We would see more tonnes going from Mosaic to our Brazil business. We would see more tonnes going
to India from our Saudi tonnage, et cetera. And there would be other imports coming into the U.S. So
overall, we don't think that this is going to make a huge difference. The big difference today is demand is
up, Chinese exports are down and we're seeing a growing market and a good demand scenario around the
world.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research.

Michael Leith Piken
Cleveland Research Company

I just wanted to get a sense on Fertilizantes of how much of the real -- the movement in the real has been
a tailwind this year. And basically, if the real were to stabilize, let's say, from this point forward and then
we hold all your other forecast that you talked about in terms of Brazilian market growth constant, what
type of impact would that have on your margins? So basically, just trying to get a sense for how we should
be thinking about that and if the real were to reverse itself a little bit and start to strengthen at some
point next year, what that might do to your margins.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Look, let me address that in 2 pieces of the business: First is our production business and the other
piece is our distribution business.

THE MOSAIC COMPANY FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 03, 2020

First of all, let me say, the weakening real, if it's had a biggest impact, it has been on the profitability
of the Brazilian farmer. So that has really been what's driving a great demand picture in Brazil. So the
Brazilian farmer is doing very well.

If you look at it in terms of our business, what we would expect is our distribution business is relatively
independent of the real pricing. And the reason for that is we buy on U.S. dollars. We sell -- we then
hedge that and convert to a Brazilian real number. So really, it doesn't have a huge effect on our overall
margins. What it does is it makes a difference to the actual demand.

In terms of our production business, though, obviously, on the shorter term, wages and everything else,
Brazil real-based costs go down fairly quickly. So we do see an improvement in cost and a better margin
for our production business.

What I will say, though, is if I look at the last couple of quarters, the Brazilian real has been essentially
flat. If I look at our statistics for the last 2 quarters, we're 5.37% versus this quarter of 5.38%. So
essentially, they've been perfectly flat. So you can assume or surmise from that, that the improvements
we're seeing is actual solid improvements in how we're running the business as opposed to a benefit from
the exchange rate.

Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets.

Joel Jackson
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Joc, one of the larger -- a large phosphate buyer -- as part of the countervailing duty investigation, a large
U.S. phosphate buyer publicly have stated that OCP offers different specs than what Mosaic can offer. They
mentioned things like solubility. Is this fact, fiction or something in between? And what can you do about it
if it's a fact?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes, this is the second time. I've had to be relatively direct. No, quality is absolutely not an issue between
the 2 commodity products. We do have very small differences in terms of some of the things that are
in our product because of what's in the ore, but recognize, this is a manufactured product that takes
phosphoric acid, adds ammonia to it to form diammonium phosphate and monoammonium phosphate.
These are chemically produced.

We have been selling this commodity in the United States for over 50 years. In that whole time, we have
seen great response on the field. And frankly, solubility isn't even one of the specs that is measured for
quality.

So it is simply a distraction. It is simply a way of taking the focus away from the real issue here and trying
to turn a commodity into a specialty product. It just doesn't work unless you're dealing with something
like MicroEssentials, in which case, the actual agronomic aspects of it are significantly better than the
agronomic aspects of the commodity products. So with that, I'll leave it there.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.

Vincent Stephen Andrews
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just wanted to follow-up on the ARO and the environmental charge. I don't think I caught it earlier. I'm
not sure if you mentioned it, but I know it was noncash in the quarter. And you talked about there would
be some cash liability in the future. I think you gave some dates. But could you actually quantify the
amount of cash liability that you'll actually have to pay out in the future?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I'm going to hand that over to Clint, but just let me give you -- look, sorry, muted microphone. I'm
going to hand it over to Clint, but let me just give you a little bit of a summary of this first, which is we
do -- once a year, we do ARO. It is over a 50-year period where we look at the overall asset retirement
obligations that we would have to do.

If we look at the asset retirement obligations themselves, their long-term water treatment at --
particularly, Plant City seems to be the biggest one here. In terms of the rest, it is work around our other
Gypstacks, which Clint can talk a little more about. But I just say, these are long-term aspects of the
business that we look at.

Clint C. Freeland
Senior VP & CFO

And so as we look at the ARO number in particular, first, recall that this is a typical process that we go
through in the third quarter of every year, and we make adjustments based on the levels of work that we
see. And part of that amount is just in changing things like assumed inflation rates, assumed interest rates
and things like that to actually bring that ARO back to current dollars to put on the balance sheet.

The -- I would say the one notable item that's embedded in that number is a reverse osmosis investment
that we'll need to make at one of the facilities in the future. I don't think it's imminent, but we'll -- that's
something that's been added as we've done more work on the work that needs to be done and as part of
the refinement of our future plans. Order of magnitude, that's probably about a $40 million investment
when it needs to be made. Otherwise, I think a lot of the adjustment is some of those assumptions that I
mentioned a little bit earlier.

And then I think on the environmental remediation, I think the ultimate cash cost is going to be right
around the $35 million mark. But again, that will be over multiple years based on the assessments today.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Your quarterly CapEx in potash is about $110 million and your depreciation is about $70 million. So it's
about $40 million per quarter above D&A, $160 million per year. Does that incremental $160 million go
away and your CapEx go to depreciation when your K3 project is done?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Let me hand that straight to Clint. I'm not sure exactly.

Clint C. Freeland
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So typically, outside of our K3 spend, the typical sustaining CapEx level can vary each year, but it's in
kind of the $100 million to $200 million per year, midpoint of about $150 million. And that's generally, as
an example, what we're seeing this year, from a sustaining level, it's about $150 million. So I think that's
what we would expect as we go forward. And obviously, we'll be migrating from K2 and K1 over to K3.
We would expect that sustaining spend to migrate with it. And so I think longer term, you will see more
alignment between sustaining CapEx spend and depreciation in potash.

Jeffrey Louis Feinberg
Feinberg Investments, LLC

Just want to make sure that I'm understanding the big picture here with all the variables we're talking
about. When you talk about the $50 a tonne in the fourth quarter off of the base that we just reported,
it looks like we're talking about a run rate of $0.5 billion of EBITDA, provided puts and takes, but am I
understanding this dynamic, correct? And if so, then we would have growth from that next year, that run
rate of $2 billion? Just to make sure I'm understanding these variables we're describing here.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Let me just do a quick in my head here. I think you're saying is -- if I'm getting your question right, is
the $50 increase in Q4 going to lead to approximately a $50 million -- or $500 million quarter for EBITDA?

And let me just do a quick math. I think we sell some 2.2 million -- 2 million to 2.2 million tonnes a
quarter. If you multiply that by 50, that would add $100 million to our EBITDA for the quarter. So if you
took our today's number and added $100 million, I guess, should be pretty close to a reasonable guess,
although you do have to take into account Mosaic Fertilizantes' seasonality and whatnot and quarter-over-
quarter there. But yes, I think that's not unreasonable starting point. It's the sensitivity would be about
$100 million.

Jeffrey Louis Feinberg
Feinberg Investments, LLC

Perfect. I mean there seems to be a lot of skepticism on the sustainability of this, but that $2 billion run
rate, it sounds like, given the end market drivers and demand, is a very conservative approach to next
year. I want to make sure I'm understanding the message being portrayed.

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

Again, if the price holds for 2021, you would again be saying much the same thing. You're looking at 9-ish
million tonnes at $50 over today. Again, the calculation is much the same. It would add $0.5 billion.

Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS.

John Ezekiel E. Roberts
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Maybe back to the capital spending question you got earlier, but are we late enough in the year to have
an outlook on 2021 at this point? And how many years do you think you can keep your overall CapEx
relatively near the current level?

James C. O’Rourke
CEO, President & Director

I'm going to hand it over to Clint for some clarification on this. But I guess, overall, look, here's our --
our big picture is our longer-term, and 2021 being no exception, our longer-term is we would have $600
million to $700 million of sustaining capital. And then today, what we're seeing is other improvement
capitals and whatnot, but the big one that starts dropping off after 2022 is, of course, the $300 million
or so we're spending on Esterhazy K3. So that capital spending comes down, but there are other areas of
improvement and high-return projects that we may want to put in there.

So how long can we maintain it flat? I think, certainly, it will go down over time. How much goes down
depends on opportunity.

I think we've come to a close now. And before I close, I'd like to invite you all to enjoy -- join us on
November 9 at 9 a.m. for our in-depth presentation on Mosaic Fertilizantes and our South American
strategy.

So with that, I want to wrap up today's call. Mosaic continues to execute extremely well. We are increasing
our global competitiveness by driving costs down. And we're managing well through the challenges of
COVID-19. With the tailwinds we're seeing today from improving fertilizer and agricultural markets, we
expect strong results to continue through the end of the year and well into 2021.

So thank you for joining us. And again, come back next week for our South American detail.

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating and you may
now disconnect. Have a great day.
