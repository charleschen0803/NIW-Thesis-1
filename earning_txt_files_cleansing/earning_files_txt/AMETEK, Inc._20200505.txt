Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 AMETEK, Inc.
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being
recorded.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin
Coleman.

Kevin C. Coleman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's First Quarter 2020 Earnings
Conference Call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

AMETEK's first quarter results were released earlier this morning and are available on market systems in
the Investors section of our website. This conference call is also being webcast and can be accessed on our
website. The webcast will be archived and made available on our site later today.

During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to change
based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from
expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is
contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC.

AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any
references made on this call to 2019 or 2020 results will be on an adjusted basis excluding after-tax,
acquisition-related intangible amortization and excluding a pretax $141 million or $0.47 per diluted share,
gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in the first quarter, and also a pretax $44 million or $0.15 per diluted
share realignment charge taken in the first quarter.

Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release, and on the
Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then
open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Despite a challenging and highly uncertain economic
environment due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, AMETEK delivered solid first quarter results,
highlighted by excellent operating performance with earnings in line with our guidance range. I will
provide more details on the first quarter results shortly, but first, I wanted to extend my thanks to all
my AMETEK colleagues and recognize them for their amazing dedication and commitment through these
difficult times. The courage and resilience I witness has been truly impressive.

As AMETEK has been deemed an essential or life-sustaining business at all our operating facilities, our
employees continue to provide critical solutions and services to customers across many industries,
including health care, defense, food and beverage and laboratory research. The health, safety and well-
being of our employees as they support these essential customers is our highest priority.

We've implemented numerous safety measures aimed at providing a safe work environment. Our
pandemic response plan provides a framework for our businesses to manage their facilities and workforce
during this pandemic. Among other things, the plan establishes personal and workplace hygiene practices,
a global communications network of site and country pandemic coordinators, and a supply chain, logistics
and operations team to provide solutions to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business.

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Daily communication with local pandemic coordinators and senior management ensures we are
complying with the Center for Disease Control (sic) [ Centers for Disease Control ] and local government
regulations. As part of the plan, we also implemented various safety measures, including work-from-
home requirements for those whose job allow, social distancing on our facilities and on our factory floors,
daily temperature monitoring of employees reporting to work, use of personal protective equipment and
staggered work shifts. We remain vigilant as we return to a higher level of operating activity.

Now let me return to the first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.2 billion, down 6.6% from the
same quarter in 2019. Recent acquisitions contributed 4%. The divestiture of Reading Alloys was a 2 point
headwind. Foreign currency was a 1 point headwind, and organic sales were down 8% in the quarter.
The measures we took during the quarter led to strong operating performance. While operating income
decreased 3% year-over-year to $276 million, operating margins expanded an excellent 100 basis points
to 23%.

Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating income margins expanded 110 basis points over
the prior year period. Decremental margins in the quarter of approximately 10% showed our operating
capability, reflecting our ability to reduce our cost structure as well as the strength and flexibility of our
operating model.

Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $342 million, up 2% over the prior year with record adjusted EBITDA
margins of 28.5%. The operating performance led to earnings of $1.02 per diluted share, up 2% versus
the comparable basis in the first quarter of 2019 and in line with our guidance range of $1.01 to $1.04.

The $44 million restructuring charge we took in the quarter is expected to generate approximately $85
million in annualized structural savings. We also generated a strong cash flow in the first quarter with
operating cash flow up 38% to $271 million. Free cash flow conversion was also strong at 148% of
adjusted net income excluding the Reading Alloys gain.

Next, I will provide additional details at the operating group level. Sales for our Electronic Instruments
Group were $774.2 million, down 4% over last year's first quarter. The acquisitions of Gatan and
IntelliPower contributed 6%. Foreign currency was a modest headwind and organic sales were down
9%. EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $194.1 million, down 4% versus the prior year. EIG
operating margins were 25.1% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating
margins expanded 20 basis points over the prior year period.

The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating performance in the quarter despite top
line weakness as a result of the coronavirus. EMG's first quarter sales were $428 million, down 11%
versus the prior year. The acquisition of PDT added 3%. The divestiture of Reading Alloys was a 6 point
headwind. Foreign currency was a 1 point headwind, and organic sales were down 7%. EMG's proactive
cost mitigation actions led to impressive margin expansion. While operating income was down slightly to
$97.5 million in the quarter, operating margins, excluding acquisitions, expanded 220 basis points to a
record 22.8%.

During the first quarter, we also completed the acquisition of IntelliPower, a leading provider of
high-reliability, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems for mission-critical defense and industrial
applications. Their products and solutions nicely complement our Power Systems and Instruments
businesses and they deepen our expertise in high-reliability power protection applications. Annual sales for
IntelliPower are approximately $40 million, and we deployed $115 million on the acquisition.

We also completed the divestiture of Reading Alloys to Kymera for $250 million. The closing of the
transaction, which occurred near the end of the first quarter, was a positive outcome for all parties as
Kymera is an outstanding strategic partner for Reading Alloys. For AMETEK, proceeds from the sales will
be deployed on our acquisition strategy, which remains our priority for capital deployment.

While we are pleased with the first quarter results, the global economic environment has obviously
changed since the start of the first quarter. In January, global demand was solid. In February, an
extended Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus resulted in disruptions in China-based activity
for customers and suppliers. Later in the month, as China slowly reopened for business, Europe and

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

the U.S. and other parts of Asia started to feel the impact of the virus. At that time, we started to limit
discretionary spend and nonessential travel. In addition, each of our businesses developed detailed
contingency plans to prepare for a potential slowdown.

In March, the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy was broadening. Many countries, states and
counties started to impose travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures for
all but essential employees. Supply chain delays started to emerge and customers turned cautious given
the building uncertainty. Although our facilities were operational throughout the first quarter given our
essential business designation, we did see a direct impact on sales in the first quarter due to the virus.

Worldwide travel restrictions limited our ability to provide support and installation services. This impacted
our EIG process and Power businesses most significantly in the quarter and a broad set of customer
delayed shipments.

Now a few comments on the demand environment in April. Demand in April was meaningfully weaker than
we experienced in March. Travel restrictions and social distancing mandates shut down all but essential
activities as customers and suppliers temporarily closed or implemented furloughs for all or parts of April.
This has inevitably led to significant disruptions and impacts on demand. Restructurings across many --
restrictions across many geographies are slowly being loosened. However, we remain cautious on the pace
of recovery.

Now let me provide some comments on what we are seeing in select end markets. Although we are
seeing challenging conditions across most end markets, we're seeing solid demand continue across our
health care, medical and defense markets, which account for approximately 20% of our sales. Our most
challenged markets are commercial aerospace and oil and gas, which combined, account for approximately
16% of AMETEK's sales. We expect meaningful weakness across these markets throughout all of 2020. In
the balance of our markets, including power, industrial, semiconductor, research, metals and automations,
we expect weak conditions in the second quarter with sequential improvements during the second half of
the year.

Shifting now to the actions we are taking to proactively manage our business while ensuring we are
supplying and supporting our key customers. As the spread of the virus expanded and restrictions
widened in March, our business began to execute on contingency plans and implemented cost reduction
actions. These contingency plans focused on maximizing cash flow, ensuring critical sources of supply
and protecting key investments, all while ensuring appropriate safety measures were in place. The
cost reduction actions we are taking include structural actions such as reduction in force and facility
consolidations as well as temporary reductions such as discretionary spend reductions, furloughs,
temporary facility shutdowns, short-time work weeks and temporary pay reductions.

Given the reduction in demand we are experiencing, we made the difficult decision to reduce our
workforce. The total reduction enforced is approximately 10% of our employee base across direct,
indirect and SG&A functions. In addition, in the second quarter, many of our businesses are implementing
furloughs or temporary facility shutdowns. These furloughs generally range in length from 1 week to 3
weeks, depending on the operating location and their customer market dynamics. The decision to furlough
operations was made to help mitigate the spread of the virus to better align our cost structure with
demand and to position us to quickly respond when demand returns.

The temporary pay reductions we implemented generally range between 15% and 20% for salaried
employees, including all AMETEK officers, with a similar reduction of fees paid to our Board of Directors. As
a result of these actions, we expect total cost savings in the second quarter of approximately $80 million,
with approximately $50 million of these savings from temporary actions and $30 million from structural
actions. As we proceed into the second half of the year, we expect the benefit from our structural cost
actions to ramp up with full year structural savings targeted at approximately $125 million. We will flex
our temporary cost savings either up or down in the third and fourth quarters based on volume levels.

In addition to these cost savings initiatives, we also reduced our capital expenditures by over 25% from
our initial plans in the year, with full CapEx -- full year CapEx now expected to be roughly $75 million.

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Before I provide commentary on our outlook for the quarter, I wanted to highlight the work AMETEK
is doing where we operate to assist in the fight against COVID-19. Through the AMETEK Foundation,
we have made more than $1.5 million in contributions to charitable organizations, many of whom are
providing food and essential items to those in need, along with personal protective equipment to the men
and women on the front lines of this pandemic. We are proud to partner with numerous organizations
around the world, where we have an operating presence to support the immense humanitarian crisis
caused by the pandemic.

I also wanted to highlight a few of AMETEK's businesses are involved in the fight against COVID-19.
AMETEK Rauland, a leading provider of mission-critical communication and workflow solutions used in
hospitals and other health care facilities, has developed the Rauland Rapid Response Kit. This solution
allows nurses and health care providers to quickly triage patients, gather necessary supplies and
determine the appropriate clinical response, all while keeping a safe distance to minimize repetitive safe
-- staff-to-patient contact. They are being deployed for use in temporary medical facilities and new patient
care facilities within hospitals to meet the surge of additional patients.

AMETEK Land is another great example. Land is a leading manufacturer of monitors and analyzers for
industrial infrared noncontact temperature measurement. In March, they released their vIRalert solution,
a temperature screening thermal imaging system designed for highly accurate human body temperature
measurement. This technology can be utilized for screening at point of entry into key facilities such as
offices, factories, schools, government buildings and transportation hubs. They are seeing strong initial
interest for the solution as temperature screening at this scale will play a fundamental role in helping to
contain the spread of the COVID-19 and allowing return to our normal data lives.

AMETEK's Powervar business is providing customized uninterruptible power systems to a number of
leading medical device diagnostic equipment providers used for coronavirus testing. These UPS systems
are being deployed worldwide. And lastly, AMETEK Advanced Motion Solutions is providing critical solutions
to manufacturers of ventilators and laboratory diagnostic equipment used in the COVID-19 response.

These are just a few of the examples of the critical roles our businesses are playing in combating this
global crisis. We are proud to be part of the solution and committed to supporting our customers in these
efforts.

As we previously announced, due to the uncertainties presented by the COVID-19 global pandemic, we
are withdrawing our full year guidance and will not be issuing quarterly guidance at this time. We will issue
guidance as condition stabilizes and visibility improves.

However, I did want to provide some level of comments about the second quarter and the balance of the
year, given what we know now. First, we expect that the quarter will be the low point in sales and earnings
this year given the broad-based uncertainty and the impact on global demand from stay-at-home orders
and travel restrictions. Second, we expect sequential improvements in sales and earnings in the third and
fourth quarters as the economy slowly reopens. And third, we expect to manage full year decremental
margins in the 25% to 30% range, with the second quarter decrementals being between 30% and 35%.

To summarize, AMETEK delivered solid results in the first quarter on strong execution through
unprecedented market dynamics. Bill will speak to this in a moment, but the actions we took in the first
quarter strengthened our already strong balance sheet and liquidity, and we are poised to emerge from
this economic crisis in a strong financial position, which will allow us to continue to deploy capital on
acquisitions and invest in our growth initiatives. We are confident in the future of AMETEK as our world-
class talent and the adaptability of the AMETEK Growth Model will continue to drive long-term sustainable
success for our stakeholders.

The message we've given to our employees is simply, while these are truly unprecedented times, AMETEK
has faced challenging and uncertain environments before. And each time, the collective strength and
talents of all AMETEK colleagues has allowed us to emerge stronger and better positioned. Together, we're
working to make sure AMETEK again emerge stronger and better positioned for the next chapter of our
growth.

I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll
be glad to take your questions. Bill?

William Joseph Burke
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Dave. I would also like to thank our colleagues around the world for their tremendous efforts
over the past few months. We have asked a lot of our colleagues as we manage the impact of COVID-19
on our business. And as always, they have risen to the challenge.

The actions our businesses took in the first quarter helped us deliver strong operating performance and
improved our already strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Let me provide some financial highlights
for the quarter.

First quarter general and administrative expenses were down $3 million compared to the same period
in 2019 due largely to lower compensation costs. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of
sales versus last year's level of 1.4% of sales. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.4%,
down from last year's first quarter tax rate of 20.5% with this lower rate in the quarter being due to tax
planning initiatives. For 2020, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. And as we've
stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from
this full year estimated rate.

Operating working capital in the quarter was 18.9% versus 18.2% in the first quarter of 2019. Capital
expenditures were $17 million for the first quarter. As Dave indicated, we now expect full year capital
expenditures to be approximately $75 million, down from our initial expectations of $100 million.

Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $66 million. For the full year, we continue
to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $265 million, which includes after-tax
acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $120 million or $0.52 per diluted share.

Operating cash flow in the quarter was outstanding at $271 million, up 38% over 2019's first quarter. Free
cash flow was $254 million, up 45% over the prior year period. And free cash flow conversion adjusted for
the Reading gain was excellent at 148%.

Total debt at the end of the quarter was $3.25 billion, up from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019. During
the first quarter, we drew down $500 million from our revolver to bolster our liquidity position. We also
deployed approximately $115 million on the acquisition of IntelliPower during the quarter. Offsetting this
debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.25 billion, which includes the proceeds from the sale of Reading
Alloys and the drawdown on the revolver. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the first quarter
was 2.2x as we are intentionally holding higher-than-normal cash balances. This ratio was comfortably
below our debt covenants of 3.5x. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x at the end of the quarter.

AMETEK is extremely well positioned to manage this economic downturn. We have more than $1.8 billion
in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives, including $550 million in available revolver
capacity. We have a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023.

To conclude, our business has delivered a solid quarter despite extraordinary challenges due to COVID-19.
Our world-class workforce, the strong cash generation of our niche businesses, and our balance sheet
strength position us well to manage this downturn and will position us well to invest in our growth
strategies over the long term. Kevin?

Kevin C. Coleman
Vice President of Investor Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Dave, if you wouldn't mind just talking a little bit about April or maybe March exit rates, just give us
a sense for what you're seeing out there. I appreciate all the color on decrementals and certainly how
margins held up in the first quarter, but maybe give us a sense for demand cadence. I know a few weeks
maybe isn't a trend at this point, but just to kind of calibrate where we're at on that first.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Sure, Josh. So there will be a substantial revenue drop in April. We were down about 25% in April. And
as we look ahead to the quarter, we can be down about 25% or a bit more or a bit less because we have
limited availability. But I'd point to that 25% that we actually were down in April.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's really helpful. I appreciate that. And then I guess on the other side of this, understanding
that some of these countermeasures on the cost side end up being temporary, some are a little bit more
permanent in nature, anything that would prevent kind of a normal incremental margin on the other side,
i.e., are you pulling on the temporary levers such that you do need to kind of reflate the cost base or
compensation metrics, et cetera, when we do finally recover it? It doesn't look like the case, but just want
to make sure that's the way you're thinking about it.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. That's a good question, and that's why there's a balance of structural and temporary cost reductions.
I mean when we -- historically, when AMETEK recover out of these downturns, we've had very high
contribution margins and I would expect the same thing to occur this time. But we're using our best
judgment and our experience with these businesses to balance the structural cost reductions with the
temporary. So we're going to have $80 million in cost savings in Q2. About $30 million of that is structural
and about $50 million of that is temporary. And then as we go through the quarters, we'll increase or
decrease the temporary cost reductions based on demand. And if it looks like demand is not materializing,
it doesn't do any good to leave around excess and unutilized resources.

So we have the capability to do more. But we have a good feel for these businesses, and we want to get
through this thing with our businesses intact. At the same time, focus on the decrementals as we get
through that. And I would expect that we would have very good incrementals as -- when we ultimately get
through the crisis and we recover.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Just to clarify, the down 25% in April, was that an organic revenue growth? And how did orders shake out?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

9

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Orders and sales were about the same. Orders were about that 25-point level, sales were just a bit more.
And that's really on the total orders and sales.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Good. And Dave, can you talk about visibility? I mean part of the AMETEK business model is you've got
healthy recurring revenues around 30%. So how do you think those hold up? And just kind of connect us
what we're seeing in terms of customer behavior, pushouts, cancellations and so forth.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes, sure. That's a good question, Deane. I mean when I think about Q1 or the end of Q1, we left
probably $40 million or $50 million, 4 or 5 points of organic growth we could not ship because our
customers weren't available to take delivery or we could not travel to the site to do the installation
and commissioning work. So it's -- that was a big deal for us. And we have to get to places in China
and around the world and in the U.S., especially in our Process and Power businesses and do that
commissioning and get that recurring revenue.

So part of -- the customer behavior part of your question is that they delayed shipments and we weren't
able to access them. And part of the recurring revenue is it's driven by the ability to service them. So I
think the recurring revenues will hold up relatively well, maybe except in the Aerospace business. But we
have to be able to travel and get to our customers and to return some normalcy there for that to happen.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's real helpful. And I appreciate all the color on the decrementals because that's absolutely within
the band that we'd expect based upon the cost-outs that you've taken. So I kind of feel like we can ask a
more forward-looking question regarding when and how can you pivot to playing offense. You've got just
an exceptionally strong balance sheet. We know M&A markets need to settle down. But what's expectation
in terms of line of sight on potential acquisitions at this stage? Or is it just too early?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

I think it's a great question, Deane, because we feel we're going to emerge from this crisis with an
excellent M&A opportunity. It's going to remain our first priority for capital allocation. Bill already went
through the strong balance sheet, the cash flow-generating capability of the companies. And we had a
very strong pipeline going into this crisis. We closed on IntelliPower in Q1. We were very close on another
deal, a very nice business. We had just felt we could not finalize our diligence and integrate it with the
restrictions caused by the virus. Certainly, it's a potential to continue with that deal post crisis because
we really like it and we have a good relationship with the sellers. And we're going to keep developing our
pipeline. We have multiple tangible opportunities post crisis, I mean a great pipeline going into this. And
we're going to use our business development team to maintain those relationships.

In terms of the current environment, buyers and sellers are focused inwardly with challenges they have
in their business. New set of buyer, there's a new set of buyer price expectations that need to get aligned
with. Seller expectations, you don't have the ability to perform face-to-face diligence to negotiate, to
integrate it. So I think it's going to be late 2020, maybe the fourth quarter of 2020, before the market
begins returning to normal, but I think we're well positioned to really capitalize on the opportunity there.
And that's the way we're thinking about this thing. We're going to preserve our balance sheet now and
make sure it's strong, and we're going to see a big opportunity when we get out of this.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Ivana Delevska with Gordon Haskett.

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

So just wanted to ask as we emerge from this, what percent of your businesses do you think could kind of
more quickly come back versus what could take longer time to get back to normal?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. That's a good question, Ivana. And it's really -- it's both end market and the time -- and the type of
business that we're talking about. As I mentioned earlier, we serve a range of different end markets. And
some of these markets are seeing solid demand. These include medical, health care, defense businesses.
And some markets are very challenged, and they're oil and gas and aerospace. So I think the Oil and Gas
and Aerospace businesses are going to be the last to pick up positively. Probably Oil and Gas will pick up
well before Aerospace. But the Aerospace downturn, we could have a couple or 2 or 3 years.

But the majority of our businesses, I think, are going to recover quite well from this. And we have high
incremental margins, and we're managing the decrementals on the way down. So I'm pretty optimistic
that we'll be able to -- we were able to expand -- the last 3 years to 2019, we grew organically 5% in a
year, greater than industrial production, and we got great margin expansion. And the environment that
we're going to have in the second half of the year and into 2021, you may be in an environment where
we're growing a little bit faster than that. So I would expect our businesses to respond and our businesses
to have better margins on the way out, and with the exception that Aerospace and Oil and Gas could be
down for a while.

Ivana Delevska
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

And in terms of mix, in terms of margin impact of those businesses kind of underperforming, would it be a
positive for margins?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think it will be a positive for margins. On the way down, our Aerospace is a pretty profitable
business. It's a couple of points more profitable than the base business. And our Oil and Gas is about at
the base business profitability. We had 20% EBITDA in the first quarter. So -- but I think if you go back
and look at the prior downturns and AMETEK's recovery from them, we've always had healthy contribution
margins on the way out because we're such a profitable business.

And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

So I'm hoping you can help me with a couple of questions on the cost save. So we came into the year with
about $90 million of sort of base productivity, as I call it. And I think I heard you say that the restructuring
charges are going to give us $85 million in savings. Do we add those numbers together?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

No. Well, yes, you do on an annualized basis. The $85 million is on an annualized basis. So when I think
about the second half of the year, we talked about $30 million, maybe $30 million in structural savings in
Q3, combined with about $50 million of variable. When we get to the second half of the year, Q3 and Q4,
we'll have about $75 million of structural savings split across those 2 quarters. So the structural savings
will ramp up. And if it plays out like we think, the temporary savings will ramp down. And we'll exit 2021
with a pretty healthy level of cost reductions on a run rate basis going into 2021.

And -- right. So the 2021 carryover on structural, what would that be?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

It's going to depend on some things, but I think it will be about $40 million. 40, 4-0.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Got it. And if you could just maybe help us understand the cadence of sales in aerospace -- commercial
aerospace and oil and gas. Certainly, we understand that they're worse, perhaps a lot worse, than the
April sales number. But is there any kind of parameter you can throw around those numbers to help us
understand what the real deltas are?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I'll give you an idea with Aerospace. And again, there's a caveat that we don't have good visibility.
But our commercial aerospace business is about 10% of the company. That includes our OE and
aftermarket. That could be down 50% and the aftermarket part of it can be down more. The OE part of it
down a little less. So that market is going to drop. It's going to be pretty significant, and we're seeing that
happen. So that's just a fact for a considerable amount of time.

Scott Graham
Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division

Yes. And oil and gas?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Oil and gas is going to have a tough time. I think the recovery is going to be faster because it's going to
be more based on a commodity price and it's not going to be as long term. It's going to be people start
driving the cars again. It's going to be definitely less than 50% for the year, but I put in the 25% range or
something like that. More so in the upstream than the downstream.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

So just going back to the decremental margins. Obviously, very impressive management of those. So
before the discretionary cost savings, what kind of gross decremental margin are we looking at here? Is it
sort of 45% type numbers? And are you confident that there's enough discretionary cost you can go after
to manage decrementals into those ranges within a reasonable revenue range?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It's an excellent question, Nigel. And if you think about this kind of environment, yes, you're going to
end up with the decremental margins of -- if we did nothing, we'd be in that 50%, 55%, some businesses
at 60% range. So what we're doing is we're mitigating that greater than 50% decremental margin in
this kind of environment. And we have a higher margin business. And the costs that we're taking out are
getting us to the 25% to 30% decrementals for the year.

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Okay. But what you're saying is there's enough discretionary costs in the short term to company
management in that range. There's no breakpoint that you see right now.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I don't see the -- it's going to be difficult. And we didn't give guidance, but we're pretty good at
managing the decrementals, and that's our focus right now. We're going month-to-month and are
operating operations or making adjustments on the level of capacity, the level of customer demands. And I
think that we can manage to that 25% to 30% level for the year.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. And then my follow-up question is, one of the keys to success for AMETEK in the past has been the
right incentives at the divisional level, some of those for growth, some for margin, cash flow, et cetera.
Given the lack of visibility right now, how have you changed the incentive structure for your divisional
managers?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

We haven't changed them as of yet. They're still based on the original targets that were set for the year.
And we're managing through this thing. And I personally -- everybody is going to feel some pain to this
process. And resetting targets to the existing level of our business isn't fair for everyone, including our
shareholders.

So it's going to be a tough year, and there's going to be less variable compensation. That opportunity
is still there, but it's not going to materialize. And that's just the way it is. And I'll talk to my comp
committee about the appropriate things in these areas. But in general, there's going to be lower variable
payments from our internal systems this year.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I just wanted to come back to the comments on the medical, health care and defense bucket at 20%.
Were you suggesting in April that was actually a positive in terms of sales and orders? And then how are
you thinking about that for the year?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think the defense, the medical, the health care are going to be positive for the year. And in April,
they didn't decline as much. So that's how we're thinking about it. That piece of our business at this point
seems that they're pretty solid. And the thing that we -- it was very encouraging in Q1, and we bought
Gatan. We have a couple of quarters of Gatan. It's still above its acquisition model. So they're doing a
great job for us. And some of our recent acquisitions, like our Rauland in the health care space, MOCON in
the food space and Telular in the IoT space, those are 3 pretty sizable deals we did over the last couple of
years. All 3 of those businesses in Q1 had double-digit quarters growth.

So we're expecting those kind of businesses to hold up pretty well. We're not sure if it's going to be plus
or minus, but it's certainly not going to be the -- they did not see that kind of decline in the quarter. We're
not going to -- you're not going to see that decline in the quarter.

Okay. Great. And then just shifting to free cash flow, very solid start to the year. What is the expectation
as we go forward here? I mean should we assume that the working capital should get a lift as the business
cycle is down? And maybe just a little bit of a framework on conversion or maybe a range you're thinking
about for the year.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think in the second quarter, you'd expect a working capital lift as you have the impact to the lower
sales level. But then some of that will get added back given the sequential increases in sales that we're
expecting. I think, overall, a good place to be would be north of 120% of free cash flow conversion to net
income for the year.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stephens.

Robert Paul McCarthy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

I guess the first question is a little bit to amplify your comments around the realignment charges you took.
I mean I guess this is consistent with kind of your practice periodically. I think the last time you did this
was kind of in the '16 time frame with the oil and gas retrenchment. You talked about a payback, I think,
of 2x or something along those lines. But could you talk about that in terms of what you're expecting for
the run rate savings again? And then just in that context, where are you -- where are you taking out the
most capacity? Is it presumably aerospace? Is it presumably these businesses that seem to be a little
more longer cycle and structurally challenged and obviously are in the news because you see a lot of
capacity being taken out across the complex?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Right. That's a great question, Rob. I mean we attempt to balance these permanent cost reductions, an
area where demand had been more impacted. So as an example, in the commercial aerospace market,
we had about a 20% headcount reduction, and we had a little bit more than the average in our oil and gas
business. And then we use a temporary approach in other areas to be positioned to respond quickly when
demand recovers. And when you think about the structural savings, that was about $30 million in Q2, and
that will increase sequentially as we go through the year. And then we'll exit the year with -- as a question
I answered earlier, with about a $40 million benefit to 2021, but we'll see increased structural savings in
Q3 and then in Q4. And we'll take our temporary savings and adjust that based on volume. But we felt
it was necessary for the permanent reductions. It's a very difficult decision, but where demand is most
impacted, not short term but more long term, we took those actions.

Robert Paul McCarthy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Yes. And just for pedagogical purposes, presumably, that's all baked into the decrementals you already
highlighted.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

That's all baked into the decrementals. Correct.

Robert Paul McCarthy
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Yes. Okay. Of course. Right. And then the second question is -- obviously, I think you answered Deane's
question very well about M&A and the opportunity set. But you are sitting on a lot of cash, but it is a very
difficult environment for potential share repurchase. You have done share repurchase in the past. I think,

14

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

notably in the fourth quarter of '18, you thought it was particularly prudent given the intrinsic value of
your company, well, if memory serves.

But how do you think about share repurchase in this environment? Or perhaps you don't have as much
visibility? And then obviously, you have the whole populism problem with share repurchase as a whole in
terms of use of capital allocation. How do you think about it? Because you do have a sizable cash balance
and even despite what we're going to see right now, still a strong prospect for continued cash generation
here.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. The first point is our priority is M&A. So we want to be able to execute on those M&A opportunities as
we clear the crisis. And we've been opportunistic with buybacks, and we have the capacity to do buybacks.
So that's something we'll consider. And our third priority, we'll maintain the consistent dividend that we
pay.

But right now, with the situation being so uncertain, we've built some extra cash. We have the liquidity.
And we're going to make sure our balance sheet is strong as we get through this crisis. And if there's
an opportunity to do buybacks, it's something we'll consider. But clearly, capital allocations, #1 priority
is acquisitions. And right now, we're just making sure we get through this thing with a healthy, strong
balance sheet and a strong company.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Eastman Richard (sic) [ Richard Eastman ] with Baird.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Dave, could you just speak to -- I'm curious a little bit here, as we move forward into the -- through
the second quarter and into the back half of the year. When I look at EIG and that segment of the
business, it does -- I think oil and gas shows up in there. Could you just talk a little bit more about some
of the process industries, how they're -- that process instruments, how they're holding together? And then
also the large commercial business, I think, falls largely in EIG. So does that suggest that EIG is weaker
than EMG as we track through the balance of the year?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

No. You think about, first, our aerospace businesses, right, because it's predominantly in EMG. So that's
going to be a headwind to EMG. But on the EMG side, I think our automation business has been through
a lot of -- it was the first business that went in. And we're already starting to see some improvements out
of China for automation business. So our automation business could be the first part of the business that
does well or recovers, it could be.

When you think about EIG, your question about process, it's a good one because process serves a wide
range of end markets which are experiencing different dynamics, different end market dynamics. On the
positive side, we're seeing solid demand in our medical, health care and high-end research businesses
within that segment. And that segment includes Rauland and MOCON and Telular and demand, and I've
already commented on those businesses and their growth drivers.

Conversely, it's the part of our business that has oil and gas, which will count overall to about 6% of
AMETEK sales. And we're going to be challenged in that part of it until the oil prices recover because
there's supply and demand imbalance. And while we expect process sales to improve sequentially in the
second half of the year, we expect the oil and gas component of it to remain challenged because of the
sizable cuts of the capital budgets and the supply and demand imbalances.

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Okay. Okay. And then just a quick question. Just a couple of thoughts, if you will, about geographies
here in the quarter and maybe do we see the same type of cadence out of Asia, China? Do we see some
recovery late in March, modest recovery? Just maybe the cadence around the geographies here as we
exited first quarter and into the second.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Sure, Rick. I mean the headline on the geography story is that there are broad-based weaknesses in
all geographies, with Europe and Asia is most challenged. And when you think about it, Asia was down
high-teens, and it was -- China was down first. It was driven by travel restrictions, inability to install and
commission our products. It was China, Japan, Korea.

And then we look at China specifically. As you got to the end of the quarter, it started to recover. And it's
recovering and improving, but it's not completely back. Our facilities over there are operating with pretty
much full capacity now. And we got our supply base up and running. But we very recently started traveling
to most customers. We're allowed to travel when doing installation and doing service work. I'll give you
an example in the research end market. There are some universities that still haven't open back up yet.
And we have some equipment waiting to be installed there. So in China, I would say it's improving, but it's
definitely not the whole way back up.

And then when we think about Europe and it was down low double digits and driven -- same kind of
drivers. The biggest impacts were our Dunkermotoren business and our process businesses in Europe.
And then when we got to the U.S., the U.S. in the first quarter was down about 3% and due to the same
customer delays and delays -- inability to commission products.

So it feels like we're kind of coming out of it in the opposite way that it has surfaced. So Asia feels like
China is recovering a bit. And it seems like the U.S. may be still had in a bit and Europe might be at the
bottom right now. So with a broad-based weakness, Europe and Asia were most challenged.

Richard Charles Eastman
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Understood. And just maybe the last question for me, sorry. But is the -- when you look at the overall
business and the type of downturns here that we're seeing in demand, that has historically not had much
impact on your pricing. Is that correct?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. It's a great question. I mean this environment is different. So we're going to have to see. But I expect
that we're going to be able to achieve the same level of price. I mean we did in Q1. Q1 '20 pricing was
good. We got 1.5% of price across our entire business. Total inflation and the impact of tariffs was about
1%. So we had a 50 basis point positive spread adding to our margin expansion. And I expect that's going
to continue for the year. But we're in an environment now where you really don't know with the fluctuating
demand patterns.

And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a couple of questions. Thank you for providing more information and great execution. Just in terms
of your supply chain in Asia and just globally, how has it -- how is it holding up with all the shutdowns in
places like India, Malaysia? I'm not sure what's happening in Indonesia. And how are you rethinking your
supply chain for the post-COVID-19 world?

16

AMETEK, INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Chairman & CEO

Yes, good question. I mean our philosophy is to always supply in the region where the demand is. And
we were moving to that even before the tariffs started. And even now with COVID, we think that makes
sense. So we want to build where the demand is. So that will give us a regional thought process around
there.

You mentioned Malaysia. Malaysia was one of the areas where we had some difficulty in the first quarter.
I mean the government came in and told us we couldn't operate. And we could not -- that was the only
place in the world that happened. And we couldn't operate for a period of time. And then we got the
authorization to operate at 25% and then authorization to go to 50%. And eventually, right now, we're at
about 100%. So it's -- the different governments around the world responded differently. And we have a
really good supply chain team, and they're out battling with all these problems and getting them solved.
And they did a good job solving that one.

So what we see across the world is -- I'll give Mexico as an example. We have suppliers in Mexico. And
Mexico is a little bit later to recognize the coronavirus threat. And then the government jumped in and
started to do all the same things that were done around the rest of the world. But they seem to implement
it with the local authorities having different levels of judgment in what was essential and what was not
essential. So we spent a lot of time. And our supply chain team did a great job during the quarter getting
suppliers turned on in Mexico when the local authorities had them -- tell them to shut them down. And
that involved us going to the authorities, telling them why they were essential as a supplier and we got
those all working.

So it's been a really, really difficult time for our supply base. And our people have done just a fantastic job
in managing it, and we expect to continue to have big problems like that during the second quarter and
as we go through this thing and we have localized problems and outbreaks that we have to deal with. And
we've got good management, and they know how to deal with these things, and we're dealing with them.
But at the same time, it creates enough of a visibility issue. That's why we went through our guidance.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And just another question on China. You did sort of say that China is getting better. What kind of lessons
-- because I think people are trying to figure out what lessons does China hold for the shape of recovery in
Europe and the U.S., like we've heard from some companies. I think Parker or Honeywell sort of seemed
to have said that March, there was this big spurt of demand coming back, but then April is a little bit
slower because the economy is not back to normal. So no, maybe it's not all the way straight up.

Could you just give more color on what's happening in China, April versus March, relative and absolute
terms? And as I said, more importantly, what lessons do you think this recovery holds for Europe and the
U.S.?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think the lessons for Europe and the U.S. is you have to follow the social distancing mandates that
the governments are putting through and you will recover. And when you recover, it's not going to be --
across China, it was a choppy recovery with different regions having different requirements on travel. I
think we're going to have the same things here.

So in terms of China, specifically, as I said before, it's recovering, but it's not completely back. So our
plants are now operating near 100% capacity because -- but what's causing us a bit of the difficulty now is
being able to travel to the customer sites and do service work and do install work. And just recently, that
started to open up, just very recently. I think in the last week, we started traveling in places like Beijing
and things to do service work.

So I think you learn from that. I mean we learned from China. It was interesting to watch within the
company, our operating people did a fantastic job in China managing through this, the COVID-19 problem.

And we have essential customers in China, and we were probably one of the few plants that were still
operating there, serving the medical customers in China. But they kind of set a work plan for us of using
temperature monitoring and PPE and thinking about how to relay out production lines and how to relay out
factory floors and talking about the flows of people within the buildings and how you quarantine someone
within the building.

And we learned from that as a company. So we learned from that. We helped in developing in China, and
we saw how it worked and what didn't work. And now that's informing our decisions in Europe and the
U.S. So it's -- and we learn something new every day and something changes every day. So I don't know
if...

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And just a follow-up. Is China up sequentially in April versus March? And thank you for answering my
questions.

David A. Zapico

And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

I wanted to dig into aerospace just a little bit more. So obviously, the outlook's weak for that area long-
term -- or longer term. But can you talk about that business? How do you guys think about it and where
there's exposure? And I'm talking about where you're exposed to production versus miles flown. And what
do you need to see come back within your businesses the most for that market to recover?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Right. That's an excellent question, Andrew. And as a reminder, AMETEK has a balanced exposure across
our aerospace and defense markets. So our total exposure is about 15% of sales. 15% of AMETEK is in
aerospace with roughly 5% to defense. So we're seeing that defense still strong, and we expect that to
continue for the balance of the year. 5% of the 15% is in commercial and business jet OEM and 5% in
the aftermarket. So that 5% in commercial and business jet OEM and the 5% of the aftermarket, that's a
roughly 10% exposure to commercial OEM and aftermarket that we think it's going to be very challenged.
So when I was talking about the potential to be down 50% and the potential that the aftermarket is down
more and the OEs maybe 50% or a little less, that's really what I was talking about.

And in terms of our exposures, we have broad exposures across essentially all key aerospace and defense
platforms. And we have a great business. I mean we have leadership positions in aerospace power
generation. We kind of revolutionized the way power is distributed around an aircraft. We're winning lots of
business there. We have an excellent business in advanced sensors and airframes and engines in all parts
of aircraft. And we have an excellent thermal management business that handles heating and cooling of
aircraft on very difficult applications.

So the fundamental businesses that we have in that space are just great businesses, and they're going
to go through a tough time. And the aerospace market is going to look different, but we have really good
management there. And as I said, we're adjusting to it now.

Yes. I mean it sounds like you're generally still positive on that business over the long term and that -- the
next question was going to be what's going on to discourage you from acquiring in that space and building
that business more or not. It seems like the latter.

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think the way that we think about it is we want a balanced end market exposure. And right now,
we're dealing with a lot in that business as we decrease. But we really like the business. We have really
sustainable businesses there with wide moats around the business. They're good businesses. They're
essential. And those businesses are going to be fine. So there's going to be an adjustment in volume
where you reset the cost structure. But when those businesses start growing, they're going to grow with a
healthy incremental margin. So we still feel good about it.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

So you touched most of the operational stuff already. So Dave, I just wanted to, like a bigger picture -- I
mean when you stepped into the role, it was like maybe the worst possible situation in terms of timing. So
what can you kind of -- what did you learn from managing that initially through an energy crisis and how
your businesses were impacted? I mean I know that that's all smaller as a percentage of sales and you
just sold Reading. So it's a different portfolio, but like what were some of the critical lessons you learned
then and how you're applying that now?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

That's a great question. And I just come back to the seasoned management team that we have at
AMETEK. I mean all of my executive office, they've been through many downturns, and they know what to
do. We know what to do. And a big part of our -- because we have such a good culture and we have such
long-term employees, they realize we're going to get through this. And the new people in our businesses
are learning from them. And we're getting through this.

And Bill and I, we've changed our management cadence. And in March, we had operating meetings with
every one of our business units. And we're going to do that again probably -- I think it starts next week
when we get through our -- this fiscal [Technical Difficulty]. It's changing the cadence. And through
those meetings, we have [Technical Difficulty] with the business. We make sure we're focused on cash
flow. We're making sure of right things for our customer base. And people learn from that. So -- and we
understand what's going on in the business.

But I think the biggest thing, when you step back and you think about this thing long term, we're
very well positioned. We have proven management capability to manage through this downturn. Our
businesses are well positioned with leadership positions, high barriers to entry, strong technology
positions, the quintessential business. And we're executing very well, generating excellent cash flow, as
evidenced by the first quarter, as evidenced by the past few years.

We got the question earlier. We have a proven capability to get price and offset inflation with price. We
have that capital deployment strategy, world-class acquisition products. There's no doubt, in my mind,
we're going to get through this and we're going to be stronger for it. But it all comes back to the people,
and we have the experience to get it done.

trough comments. And maybe any color that you've been having -- on the conversations that you've been
having with your customers there in terms of the cadence for volumes in the back half as some of these
facilities, especially for Boeing, are starting to start back up. Curious if you would expect to feel the pull
from the facilities as soon as they start up. Or do you think they have enough inventory to start initially
and then they would come back to you once that normalizes?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think it's a mix, Ken, because there's going to be -- you think about a production line. There's
going to be something they need right away. And there's going to be some excess inventory. So it's
a mix of things. And as I said before, what we're seeing in -- what we saw in April is that business is
challenged, substantially challenged. So that -- it's going to take a while for that business to adapt to --
those customer bases to the new demand. And the fact that we have balance in our Aerospace business,
and we have 5% of it in defense of the 15%, it really helps us because we have some solid demand there.
So -- but we'll definitely recover as the business recovers, but it's going to take some time. And quite
honestly, all those customers haven't even decided what the new build rates are going to be. So they're
just deciding that now and those conversations are going on.

Kenneth H. Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got it. No, that's helpful. And then just one more for me, bigger picture. I'm just curious about your
conversations with customers around the automation solutions that you guys provide. Do you think
customers may be looking more towards automation after having the deal with, first, tariffs and now the
pandemic? Just how are you thinking about that market as we kind of progress through this down cycle
and maybe looking towards the other side?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I mean the automation business has an excellent opportunity because if you want to eliminate -- in
the area of social distancing, that's going to drive demand for automation. So it's a demand driver on the
exit of this that wasn't there before we went in. And again, in our Automation business that was weaker
in 2019, we started to see that business normalized run rate later in the first quarter, particularly in
China. So pretty positive on our Automation business. And we think we were always positive on it because
there's long-term demand drivers. And right now, our Automation business is spending time a lot with
the medical -- in the medical world with providing automation systems for some of these testing devices
for coronavirus, where they have to test multiple samples. So they're using our -- more automation
equipment to do that. So we're positive on it, and that business is going to do well going forward.

Kenneth H. Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And just one quick follow-up to that is do those automation markets typically have -- are those considered
margin accretive to the base business?

David A. Zapico
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think it's margin accretive to EMG, for sure.

I'm showing no further questions at this time. So with that, I'll turn the call back over Vice President of
Investor Relations, Kevin Coleman, for closing remarks.
