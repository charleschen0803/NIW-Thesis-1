Thanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone
Edison International is off to a solid start in 2017. Today, we reported strong first quarter earnings of $1.11 per share compared to $0.85 per share a year ago
It is early in the year, so for now, we have left our full-year guidance unchanged, since our normal practice is to wait until more of the year has gone by before formally updating guidance
At the same time, we recognize there is a bias toward the upper-half of the range
Maria will cover this in detail in her remarks
My comments today focus on Southern California Edison's long-term growth opportunity
I'll start with the SCE 2018 General Rate Case
SCE's filing outline a continued focus on infrastructure reliability investment
It also proposed the first elements of a multi-year grid modernization initiative, one that will be a key enabler of California's ambitious climate change policies, as well as supporting improved system reliability and public safety
As I have said before, California has only 13 years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels
Policymakers have identified a robust, modernized electric grid as a critical element in the effort to achieve significant GHG reductions
The CPUC will set SCE's initial pace for grid modernization in its GRC decision
Agreeing on the right pace for grid modernization will be a key topic in the GRC process, as we saw two weeks ago
In testimony submitted by the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, or ORA, they recommended zero capital spending for this key enabler of climate and clean air policy
This is contrary to the CPUC's stated goal of completing grid modernization by 2025, and we don't believe is consistent with California's climate policy objectives
Testimony from other intervenors is due tomorrow
We will respond to all intervenor testimony on June 16. We will reiterate the strong case we believe we have made for these investments in our GRC filing
In terms of rate base, ORA's overall capital spending recommendations would still yield annual rate base growth of 6.6% to 2020, above the industry average, compared to our request case of 8.6% average annual growth
This includes ORAs acceptance of about 90% of our non-grid modernization capital spending recommendations
Once we have testimony from other intervenors, we will provide an update to reflect the overall picture of intervenor positions as it relates to capital spending, and rate base, and any other major new issues
You'll hear more from us on this topic in our May Business Update investor presentation
Transmission is another important element of SCE's growth opportunity
SCE is extending and strengthening its system through a number of major projects
The paths to permitting and constructing these projects are complex, but the benefits to system reliability and greenhouse gas emissions reductions cannot be understated
This is especially important as we look ahead to the retirement of a number of gas-fired power plants owned by third parties
These are located along the coast, many in our service territory
These plants have to shut down or repower due to the future prohibition on the use of once-through cooling water
Most of them have to shut down by the end of this decade
Other projects will enable increased access to renewable energy resources
These are necessary to meet our 33% renewables target by 2020. It is particularly important to avoid regulatory delays on these and future transmission projects; these projects are foundational if we are to add new sources of low-carbon renewable energy to the grid as soon as possible
On April 12, we launched the first in our planned Edison Insights teleconferences
The topics were California's climate change policies and transportation electrification
I won't repeat the details of the call, but for those of you who could not participate, let me summarize just a few key points
First, we provided more context for the potential $1 billion multi-year investment opportunity, not currently included in our capital forecast
Most of this relates to transportation electrification
Given the broader discussion on the April 12 call, we see even more to be done in the next decade
The day after our Edison Insights call, the CPUC issued its scoping ruling on the utility transportation electrification filings
The CPUC is targeting decisions on our pilot project proposals in October of this year, and on our much larger medium and heavy-duty vehicle charging proposal in April of next year
These proposals represent a total potential investment of $574 million, almost all of it capital spending and rate base opportunity
On our April 12 call, we indicated we'll likely file our request for the second phase of our SCE Charge Ready program in the spring of next year
We will continue to target the balance of the 30,000 commercial charging systems in this phase
Now, 30,000 is roughly a third of the 100,000 systems SCE estimated would be needed to achieve the SCE service territory share of California's 1.5 million electric vehicle target by 2025. Our early cost estimate for these 30,000 charging systems was about $225 million
We will leverage the experience from our current pilot program in estimating average per-unit capital costs for this filing
A second key discussion point was the potential need for significantly more commercial charging infrastructure longer-term
This is based on the California Air Resources Board's, or CARB's recently published targets for zero emission vehicles
CARB's January 2017 recommendation calls for 4.2 million zero emission vehicles to be on the road by 2030. This goes well beyond the 2025 target I mentioned
SCE estimates that 1.9 million of these could be in our service territory, and could require as many as 220,000 commercial charging systems
In fact, as we analyze other alternative scenarios, we can see the potential need to double CARB's target of 4.2 million zero emission vehicles on the road by 2030 to meet California's GHG reduction and air quality targets in a more cost-effective way
The application we expect to file next year for the balance of the 30,000 charging systems will likely be followed by filings for significant additional investment in charging infrastructure in the next decade
Our sense is that, there will be policy support for having SCE make much of the necessary infrastructure investment
We see our main role as owning the electrical infrastructure up to the charging station, but typically not the charging station itself, and we believe there is good support for this general split of responsibilities
We will continue the conversation about our long-term growth opportunities
Our next Edison Insights teleconference will be this summer
It will focus on the long-term outlook for the distribution system
We will put grid modernization and infrastructure reliability into a longer-term context
There are two other topics I'd like to cover now
The first is the cost of capital settlement among the three investor-owned utilities and two key consumer advocate groups, ORA and TURN, covering the 2018 through 2019 period
Last week, the CPUC withdrew the proposed decision recommending settlement approval, and two new Administrative Law Judges were co-assigned to the proceeding
The next step will be to issue a revised or new proposed decision, but the CPUC has not yet provided information on timing or on reasons for these extra steps
We continue to believe the settlement is full and fair, and given that there have been no comments from other parties on the settlement, we expect it will eventually be approved
The last item is the status of the SONGS regulatory proceeding
We were disappointed to receive the news in March that the International Chamber of Commerce, or ICC, arbitration tribunal found that, while MHI was responsible for the defective design of the SONGS replacement steam generators, the contractual limit of liability capped MHI's obligations
This came in an unusual 2-to-1 decision; we understand these are normally unanimous decisions
The SONGS owners were awarded damages capped at the $137 million contract limit
Given the limited grounds to appeal an ICC arbitration award, SCE and the other owners have decided not to appeal the tribunal's decision
As we have mentioned before, as soon as the decision has been redacted for proprietary information, we will make it publicly available
As we expected, the majority of redactions have been requested by MHI
The next steps in the CPUC-ordered meet-and-confer process will be additional meetings to be held over three days in June under the auspices of a mediator, the Honorable Layn Phillips
He is a former U.S
District Court Judge, and is a leading alternative dispute resolution mediator
Reflecting this new schedule, the SONGS' owners and most of the parties to the meet-and-confer process filed a request last week with the CPUC to extend the deadline to report on the status of the meet-and-confer process out to August 15. We are taking the meet-and-confer process very seriously, and we will engage fully and in good faith with the parties in the upcoming mediation
Same time, given our strong conviction that the existing settlement is fair and reasonable, and that the late-notice ex parte discussion between the former CPUC president and a former SCE executive had zero impact on the 10 months of negotiations among the settlement parties, we are prepared to return to litigation if the meet-and-confer process is ultimately not successful, and the CPUC takes that step
Whatever the path to ultimately resolving the SONGS matter, we are committed to doing our part to do this as expeditiously as possible, so that we, the other parties, and the CPUC and its staff can focus our collective time and resources on the other important topics we have at hand
Investing in a safe and reliable grid, modernizing the grid to support customers' choices of distributed resources, and using the grid to decarbonize our economy and clean our air are the major opportunities that the people of California are depending on all of us, together, to get right for our state's future
Well, before I turn it over to Maria, I have just one additional set of comments, and it's bittersweet
After 10 years with Edison International, Scott Cunningham will be retiring at the end of June, so this will be our last earnings call together
We expect to be able to name Scott's replacement very soon, but that individual is going to have some very large shoes to fill
Scott has been an outstanding leader on our team, and we will all miss him
Although we know that he and his wife Kathy (13:47) have great plans for many happy years ahead together
Even before joining EIX, Scott had a diverse career in Investor Relations at AES and also at Praxair, where he established their IR program
Scott's 20-year career at Praxair, which had just been spun-off from Union Carbide Corporation, included leadership roles in corporate strategic planning, business development and marketing, and finance
You all might not know that Scott began his career in research and water quality programs at the U.S
Department of Interior and the U.S
Environmental Protection Agency
It is so hard to imagine Investor Relations here at Edison without Scott
He built our program into something truly special
While I and the rest of our team just think the world of him, frankly the report card that matters the most is that from our investors, and by all measures, you have also given him an A+ in your informal comments, and in more formal ratings
Most recently, Institutional Investor Magazine placed Scott on the 2017 All-America Executive Team as the number two ranked IR professional in our industry, and has recognized Scott in the top rankings for several years
Scott's expertise is undeniable, but his contributions can't be captured just by numbers
And saying that Scott is an expert investor relations professional doesn't even begin to express what he has meant to us
Scott combined integrity, intellectual curiosity, and deep knowledge of our company's strategy and disclosures with a true commitment to transparent and effective communications for our investors
Scott has also been a wonderful coach and mentor to many within our organization
He has served on the Board of Trustees at the California Science Center on the company's behalf
And – it's a fun one – he was involved in bringing the Space Shuttle Endeavour to the Science Center, as well as supporting the California Science Center Foundation's educational programs
On top of it all, and I can say this after having spent many weeks on the road with Scott to visit with many of you, I can confirm that Scott met the ultimate test
He is still fun to be with even when you're stuck together in yet another airport after yet another flight cancellation
We wish Scott and Kathy (16:10) all the best in their new adventures, but we all are
and especially I am
so very sorry to see him retire
Scott, thank you so much for your outstanding leadership and friendship
You are just simply the best, my friend
With that, I'll turn the call over to Maria
Hey Ali, it's Pedro
I don't think we're in a position to speculate on timing, what we've done is, we've provided visibility to the three sessions that are coming up in June
But just don't want to speculate or presume that we get resolution to these three sessions or one or two of them, the parties decide to go into more sessions, so the parties decided to have mediation, it's not going to work out, so just want to stick to the timeline as we've given it, and not speculate further
Hope you appreciate that
Again, I'm not going to be able to give you any sort of quantification of probabilities left or right on that
I think, what we said before, and would reaffirm now is, certainly open to that
The PUC staff set a schedule for the first set of settlement discussions
So we'll take them seriously, and see how it goes
So now, certainly intellectually open to that, but not in a place where we can give you a probability in either direction
Thanks, Ali
All right, Julien
Let me start with the SONGS piece, and turn it over to Maria or Ron Nichols for the ramp question
On the SONGS piece, kind of similar to the answer I gave Ali, don't really want to speculate on where this may go
I think, answering your question head-on, I think anything is possible
Parties could decide that they want to continue discussions
I'm not aware of (31:09) a predetermined drop-dead date or what have you
So I think we'll leave it fairly open at this point, and see where it goes
Let me turn it over to Maria on the ramp question
So, still same comments that we made last time around, we've given folks visibility into the costs for 2017, $0.25 guidance at the total holding company level, $0.08 of that is Edison Energy, and then we will be coming back sometime in the fall with comments on the broader business plan
And that we do expect to be able to provide some insights on, at what point we would get the business to or expect to get the business to breakeven
So nothing new to report there yet
Look forward to chatting about it in the fall, Julien
Thanks, Julien
Michael
in my comments, and we view the settlement as a very fair one
TURN, ORA, the utilities all agreed to it, and importantly, there were simply no comments from anybody else in the proceeding
So there was no stated opposition to it
We're not aware of anything
Of course as I also said in my comments, I don't think, the PUC has made any public statements about the reason for the withdrawal of the PD or what the timing will be for next steps
We are staying tuned in that regard
Thanks, Steve
Hey, Greg
Thanks, Greg
And just to put an accent on that, when you think about it, Kevin Payne, and the team at SCE, at any point in time, I have a dozen or more different individual projects going on in areas of opportunity
So that adds to the rationale behind Maria's point about, this is not a simple linear process, there's real work underlying it with implementation steps that have to be taken
Yeah
Thanks, Praful
I'll take this one, and I think, you'll hear a repeat of similar comments I've made in prior earnings calls, general comment with Mr. Cunningham sitting here next to me, where he usually reminds me that, that we don't comment on M&A
And then, I might go further and just say that, as we look at the environment, it is an environment where we are fortunate that we have these strong organic growth opportunity that we do at SCE, some not all, but some of the transactions that we've seen out there have been expensive acquisitions done by folks who don't enjoy the same sort of organic growth opportunity, so we don't feel any pressure to go pay the heavy premiums that you're seeing in the current market, in order to go chase further growth
That said, you never say never, always we remain open to understanding the landscape, but it'd have to be at a value point that is different from what we've seen in the market recently
And finally, if you'll ever see us do a transaction, it will be very well considered in terms of not only the valuation aspects, but the actual real work behind the transaction, which is the integration aspects
That's where you see a lot of deals goes out, and when you actually get real people and real teams together, and have to merge companies, and having done some of that in my days as a consultant, we know it's very hard work
I'll give you a quick answer, and Kevin Payne or Ron Nichols might elaborate more
Thinking of the reality in our current California market is that, these resource stack includes gas, gas is needed, and I think, I've even said in prior comments that we need to make sure that the market pricing structures are fair to all the parties involved, and certainly we're seeing the pinch that gas generators are feeling
That said, over the longer-term, as we see the state continue to move towards 40% greenhouse gas reductions by 2030 and 80% by 2050, we do expect that, the amount of gas in the system will continue to be squeezed down, if the state is really going to make this greenhouse gas reduction and air quality targets
Kevin or Ron, anything you guys would add to that or?
Just on that point that, you might have seen, I think we talked publicly about couple of projects we did at two of our utility owned peakers, where we integrated 10 megawatts of battery storage into each of those 50 megawatt peaker projects
And to Ron's point, that's the kind of flexibility that's needed because more and more gas isn't about meeting peak demand, it's about meeting the ramps in the much more volatile California system
Hi, Angie
Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc
Hi, how are you? So, just a couple of small questions
So on the MHI reversal of legal costs, I understand that you haven't recorded it yet
But could you quantify it, assuming the current allocation of the award, would it be about $0.09?
The GRC decision is where we expect to get firm guidance on re-modernization by way of what approval that we get for the grid mod request that we made there
Thanks, Trav
