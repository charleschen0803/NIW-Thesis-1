Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Allegion Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau.
Please go ahead.

Tom Martineau
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning. Welcome, and thank you for joining us for Allegion's Second Quarter
2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and
Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.

Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to
in today's call, are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived
on our website.

Please go to Slides 2 and 3. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered
forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities
law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual
results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these
forward-looking statements.

Today's presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the
reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details. Dave and Patrick will now
discuss our second quarter 2021 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]

Please go to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered a very strong quarter,
and I would like to thank the employees of Allegion for their contributions and efforts. Our employees are
the greatest strength of Allegion. Their dedication to safety and customer excellence is outstanding. And
our teams have moved quickly to adapt to opportunities in a dynamic market.

Before I jump into the financials, I want to give you a high-level update on recovery trends and the
business overall. The pandemic has changed our world and created volatility throughout the last 18
months, both in terms of the economic contraction last year and the current economic rebound we are
seeing. Starting in Q1 and accelerating in Q2, demand surged faster and stronger than expected. This is
a positive sign and provides confidence in the sustainable economic recovery. In fact, Allegion is already
returning to pre-pandemic demand levels. At the same time, the robust demand is constraining the global
supply chain's ability to fully meet the pull for labor and materials, especially electronic components.

Allegion has built a record nonresidential backlog in 2021, which is a healthy sign of strong demand,
and we believe Allegion will be well positioned for the remainder of this year and for 2022. In another
positive sign of recovery, our Americas electronics grew more than 20% in the second quarter. There
was strong demand for electronic residential products and in the nonresidential retrofit, repair and small
project opportunities. Allegion is not immune to inflation and the supply chain constraints impacting the
industrial markets. Allegion navigated well during Q2, but these industry-wide constraints will persist for
the remainder of the year and put pressure on margins for the short term. We will leverage the strength of
our supply chain management capabilities as well as price to mitigate these impacts. During the pandemic,
we were also able to restructure the business and make it leaner, while keeping our front-facing and
strategic investments. Allegion is stronger exiting the pandemic than when we entered it.

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2021

Now let's turn to the second quarter performance for more details. Please go to Slide 5. I'm pleased
with the company's second quarter results. We delivered strong performance in all areas. Revenue for
the second quarter was $746.9 million, an increase of 26.7% or 23.8% organically. The organic revenue
increase was driven by the favorable comparable created by last year's shutdowns, solid price realization
from the price increase announced earlier this year and the increased market demand, which returned to
pre-pandemic levels. Currency tailwinds provided a boost to total revenue and more than offset the impact
of divestitures.

Adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points in the second quarter. The restructuring and cost
management actions taken during 2020 along with volume leverage have offset the accelerated inflation.
We are also seeing cost creep back from reductions experienced last year during the pandemic. Mix is also
a margin headwind due to our strong residential growth.

Adjusted earnings per share of $1.32 increased $0.40 or 43.5% versus the prior year. The increase was
driven largely by the expanded operating income with some benefits also coming from a favorable tax
rate and share count. Year-to-date available cash flow came in at $249.6 million, an increase of $146
million versus the prior year. The increased cash flow was driven by higher net earnings, along with
improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures.

Please go to Slide 6. Last quarter, I shared with you Allegion's build, borrow, buy approach to accelerating
seamless access. Today, I want to briefly focus on the borrow innovation engine in our strategic pillar to
be the partner of choice. Allegion participates in recognized, secure industry-leading platforms. We expand
our reach through strategic relationships with recognized experts and tech innovators, and we leverage
open standards. By doing this, we not only set up Allegion as the partner of choice and a continued leader
in the IoT marketplace, we also ensure Allegion has its choice of strategic partners as well. Allegion has a
growing breadth of strategic partners, mega tech, software and product integrators, our venture portfolio
and technology alliance and industry consortiums. We are executing on our partnership strategic pillar and
here are a few recent examples.

Allegion was showcased at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference. We are expanding our innovation
with Apple in both the residential and commercial marketplaces. In the smart home space, Schlage will
soon be growing its connected portfolio with a new device that allows people to easily and securely unlock
their doors with just a tap using home keys for the iPhone or the Apple Watch. At the same time, we are
extending our work with Student ID in the Apple Wallet to offer more access control options to universities
and colleges, enterprises and their students plus employees. Allegion renewed our engagement with
the Matter Work Group, a mega-tech consortium. Through this partnership, we're working to establish a
secure connectivity standard for the future of the smart home that will ultimately allow more seamless
connections between more IoT devices.

We announced Allegion Venture investments in both Mint House and Mapped, 2 startups driving new value
in a post-COVID world through revolutionary experiences and technology. And we completed a brand-new
cloud-to-cloud integration with Openpath, leveraging our ENGAGE technology and Schlage NDE and the
LE mobile-enabled smart locks. Through these partnerships, we're investing in promising innovation. We
are leveraging developer-friendly APIs and open standards. Allegion is building strategic, commercial and
technical relationships. We are collaborating with recognized experts who also understand and embrace
how Allegion creates value by securing people and assets with seamless access wherever they reside,
work and thrive.

Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our revised '21 outlook
and to wrap up.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide #7. This
slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2020,
reported earnings per share was $0.80, adjusting $0.12 for charges related to restructuring expenses, the
2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.92. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.36,

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2021

driven by volume leverage, along with continued benefits from cost control measures and restructuring
actions taken in 2020. Favorable price and currency also contributed to the increase. The combination of
these items offset headwinds from inflation, bounce back variable costs related to reduced volume from
the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable mix.

Favorable tax rate drove a $0.06 increase in earnings per share. Divestitures had a positive $0.01 per
share impact and offset the impact of other income and interest expense. Investment spend increased
during the quarter and reduced earnings per share by $0.05. As a reminder, the incremental investment
spend is predominantly related to R&D, technology and market investments to accelerate future growth.
This results in adjusted second quarter 2021 earnings per share of $1.32, an increase of $0.40 or 43.5%
compared to the prior year. Lastly, we had a $0.01 per share reduction related to restructuring charges
and acquisition and integration expenses. After giving effect to these items, you arrive at the second
quarter 2021 reported earnings per share of $1.31.

Please go to Slide #8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue performance for the second
quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As
indicated, we experienced organic revenue growth of 23.8% in the second quarter as higher demand and
a favorable comparable drove significant volume increases versus the prior year. We also experienced solid
price performance coming in over 2%, which is up sequentially. Currency continued to be a tailwind to
total growth and more than offset the impact of divestitures. In total, reported revenue came in at 26.7%
growth.

Please go to Slide #9. Second quarter revenues for the Allegion Americas segment were $549.4 million,
up 23.7% on a reported basis and 22.9% organically. While the strong growth reflects the impact of
COVID-related shutdowns last year, it is also the result of accelerated market demand. The region
continued to deliver good price realization. On volume, Americas nonresidential experienced high single-
digit growth driven by retrofit, repair and small projects. Americas residential was outstanding, again,
experiencing growth of more than 70%. The significant growth from the prior year was primarily due
to facility closures in 2020. However, we continue to see strength in retail point-of-sale and new home
construction.

Electronics revenue was up high 20s percent. We experienced electronics growth in both the nonresidential
and residential businesses. Electronics and touchless solutions will continue to be a long-term growth
drivers. The accelerated demand, coupled with labor and parts shortages, especially in electronic
components is resulting in elevated backlogs as we enter the third quarter, particularly in nonresidential.
The timing of when we see the revenue could shift as the industry works through the supply chain
constraints.

Americas adjusted operating income of $150.5 million increased 21.3% versus the prior year period,
and adjusted operating margin for the quarter was down 50 basis points. The decrease was driven by
headwinds related to inflation, bounce back costs and unfavorable mix more than offsetting the volume
leverage. While the price productivity inflation dynamic was slightly positive on a dollar basis, it did have a
60 basis point dilutive impact on adjusted margins as did the incremental investment spend.

Please go to Slide #10. Second quarter revenues for the Allegion International segment were $197.5
million, up 36% and up 26.6% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven predominantly by
strength across all European countries and businesses as markets continue to rebound. Part of the year-
over-year growth was due to the comparative impact of COVID-related shutdowns in the prior year.
Favorable currency impacts also contributed to total revenue growth and were slightly offset by divestiture
impacts. International adjusted operating income of $18.5 million increased more than $18 million versus
the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased by 920 basis points. The margin
increase was driven primarily by solid volume leverage, benefits from lower operating costs due to the
restructuring and cost control actions taken during 2020 as well as favorable currency impacts. All of
these offset the higher inflation and bounce back costs, which had a 150 basis point impact in incremental
investments, which were a 20 basis point headwind.

Please go to Slide #11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2021 came in at $249.6
million, which is an increase of $146 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven

by higher earnings, improvements in net working capital and reduced capital expenditures. Our cash flow
generation continues to be a strong asset for the company.

Looking at the chart to the right, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues decreased based on a
4-point quarter average. This was driven by improved asset turnover in both receivables and inventory.
The business continues to generate strong cash flow and is well positioned to deliver $500 million in
available cash flow for the year.

I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update for our full year 2021 outlook.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide #12. At the end of Q2, leading indicators continue to be positive.
I'm increasingly optimistic on the economic recovery. The Americas residential business continues to be
hot. On the nonresidential side of Americas, demand accelerated for retrofit, repair and small projects and
is recovering in new construction. However, labor and part charges are proving to be challenging, and we
are building a strong backlog that will benefit us in the future. With these parameters in place, we are
raising our outlook for total revenue in the Americas to be up 4.5% to 5% and organic revenue to be up
4% to 4.5% in 2021.

In the Allegion International segments, markets continue to recover led by our Germanic and Global
Portable Security businesses. Currency tailwinds more than offset the divestiture of our QMI door business
and contribute to total growth. For that region, we are raising our outlook for total revenue growth to
13.5% to 14.5% with organic growth of 8.5% to 9.5%. All-in for total Allegion, we are now projecting
total revenue to be up 7% to 7.5% and organic revenue to increase to 5.5% to 6%. We are also raising
our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $5.15 to $5.30 and adjusted EPS to
be between $5.25 and $5.40. This guide incorporates pricing actions to mitigate the inspected -- the
expected impact of direct material inflation. We anticipate these inflationary challenges will persist for the
balance of the year and we will continue to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions.

Our outlook for available cash flow is also being raised and is now projected to be $490 million to $510
million. The outlook assumes investment spend of approximately $0.20 per share. The full adjusted
effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 12%. The outlook for outstanding diluted shares
continue to be approximately 91 million shares.

Please go to Slide 13. Allegion continued its great start in 2021. We have managed the business extremely
well and leading indicators in specific market indices related to our business continue to be positive.
Looking forward, we are prepared to navigate the pressures related to accelerated inflation and labor and
parts shortages. We are encouraged by the positive resiliency of our supply chain and we will continue to
manage these challenges for the balance of the year. Thank you.
Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So I guess first question on the margin front. Obviously, there's kind of the [indiscernible] the math on
price cost, even though you're positive on a dollar basis. And I would imagine a little bit of mix headwind
on the resi side as well. But if you just kind of take a giant step back and put some of the mechanical
items aside, do you feel like getting price or managing inflation in logistics and all the other kind of
inflationary headwinds, labor is any different than it is -- has been normally? Or is that -- has that gotten
a little bit more challenging and sort of hard to parse through some of the different moving pieces there.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Yes. I would characterize it this way, and you're right, there's a lot of [indiscernible] the math. But what
we've seen is an acceleration of inflation, predominantly in commodity costs, material components,
freight, packaging, et cetera. It's continued to be a headwind. As you know, we're pretty aggressive
moving on price. And we're taking similar actions in the back half of this year. We went ahead and
announced a price increase that will take effect at the beginning of Q4. So there's going to be some
margin pressure, I would say, given the acceleration in inflation, particularly in Q3. I expect price to offset
material inflation.

The issue is really in some of the other components as it relates to packaging, freight, those type of
things. We'll drive productivity to help mitigate those type of things like we have previously. But it's
going to be a challenge. There will be some margin pressure in the back half of the year. But I feel very
confident relative to margin improvement as we go into 2022 predominantly because of the carryover
price, and we'll continue to take pricing actions next year. We'll have an improved mix profile as it relates
to the nonresidential business growing faster and accelerating more so than the residential business. And
we're not going to have these bounce back costs, which were an issue for us in Q2 and will kind of linger
during Q3, Q4 this year.

So I think to answer your question, Josh, we'll continue to manage the business. We'll get through some
of these supply chain challenges. That in and of itself will also put a little bit of margin pressure because of
some of the inefficiencies at the factories. But we'll manage through it. Margins sequentially will improve
in the second half relative to the first half, still down year-over-year. But then in [ 2020, ] expect margin
improvement to accelerate.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on the comment, Dave, you made on record
backlog. Maybe if you could unpack that a little, because I would imagine some of that is resi where you
probably don't really want a lot of backlog there that's more indicative of lead times and supply chain stuff
than it is necessarily like a long-cycle business. So maybe break down the components of that? How much
is nonresi? Is the market getting better and reopening in retrofit versus we're just carrying more backlog
in resi because the whole supply chain's lengthened?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

So I want to be clear, the backlog issue is not a residential problem. Our residential backlog slightly above
what we'd normally run. The backlog creation has been on the commercial side of the business and the
rapid build has really happened over the last 60 to 90 days. The commercial backlog predominantly on

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2021

the Americas business is double normal, and it was really driven by the acceleration of order demand
that we started seeing in April. And I'll give you some backdrop here. You go back December, January,
February, March, and we would have talked about this in the Q1 call, commercial institutional demand
in the Americas business was down low double digits, and it's like someone turned on a light and it's --
extremely pleased with that demand acceleration. We're doing a good job of, I think, processing that
through, but there's supply constraints and it's resulted in a record backlog that I think we'll continue to
see.

There's been analysts out there that have said we've done a better job of managing this, and I believe
that to be true. Our supply chain is strong and we're going to benefit from that trend. I'd also share
one other comment is, the macroeconomic forecast on what I'd say, the commercial break fix was not
particularly clear. In fact, I've got economic reports that would suggest that the repair replacement would
have been soft even today. That switch came back on. We've gained that opportunity in -- so why couldn't
we have seen it? When you shut off access to college campuses, hospitals and commercial buildings for
400 days, you get pent-up demand. And that's what we're seeing reacting positively in the marketplace.

Operator

The next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I kind of want to follow up on the margin commentary, but maybe from a bit of a different angle. So
guidance implies a pretty material ramp in margins into the back half of 2021. My back of the envelope
math puts maybe margin in the low 21% range versus low to mid 19s in the first half. Could you just kind
of help unpack the drivers of the step higher because guidance is not implying much volume leverage into
the back half. So is this more price catching up to cost, freight normalizing, mix normalizing? Any color on
that step higher into the back half would be appreciated.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So that trend is not uncharacteristic. From a seasonality perspective, margins, if you kind of look
at it over a historical time period, stronger back half of the year. So that's not unusual. I think as we
characterized sequentially, margins are expected to increase. It's the year-over-year comparison that we
would expect some degradation just kind of given some of the things we outlined relative to inflation.

Christopher M. Snyder
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Appreciate that. And then, I guess, following up also on the record backlogs. It sounds like revenue on
some level was constrained just by the supply chain issues that everyone is feeling. And it also sounds like
the back half or the full year growth guidance is also reflecting uncertainty as to when these backlogs will
be released, whether it's the back half of '21 or into '22. Could you provide any color on maybe how much
or how significant revenues were may be constrained in the quarter just because of those supply chain
issues? And then how we should -- what level of maybe supply chain conservatism is baked into the full
year organic growth guidance?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

So we -- when we look at the demand relative to what we could ship, I mean there is going to be a
disconnect there, just kind of given the supply chain constraints. And I think you're aware, Chris, we
normally carry a light backlog, highly specified engineered product, quick turnover in our manufacturing
facilities to the customer. That has been elevated kind of given some of the constraints. But to answer
your question specifically, it could be 1%, 1.5% kind of total revenue Allegion that's constrained that will
get the revenue. So it's not a question of if, it's just a question of timing. So we look at it as a timing kind

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2021

of transitory issue. And if the supply chain constraints persist, we'll get that in 2022, which means revenue
in '22 would be accelerated more so than the overall market demand.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would add a couple of other comments. Clearly, supply constraints ended the rapid acceleration of
demand that we saw helped build backlog. I would say -- we will -- over this entire pandemic and
downturn, the resiliency of the Allegion supply chain, I believe, was stronger than the competition. And
we're going to come out of this better. So I feel good about that. I think the other thing you've got to
think about, we're not alone in this. In the retrofit community and new construction, the entire project is
affected by this. And we just got to navigate in that environment.

Operator

The next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur of Imperial Capital.

Brian William Ruttenbur
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Yes. So I have 2 questions. Can you talk about the commercial office performance in the quarter? How
much was this sector down year-over-year? How much did commercial office represent in terms of
revenue in the quarter? I'm just trying to get a data point where you are.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So we don't really provide revenue by vertical markets. But I would just say, in terms of market
demand, i.e., order intake activity, what we're seeing specification, et cetera, commercial office space is
lagging institutional segment. And a lot of that is just not kind of keeping pace with what we're seeing
in terms of the rebound and repair retrofit, new construction. So hopefully that provides you with ample
color there.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I'll maybe give you a little bit more. Again, we don't split out that commercial segment as stand-alone,
but the strength that we saw in the first half was really driven by strong wholesale, small project and
retrofit business. Where that business ends up, we don't have precise [ theory ] on, but there's -- the
snapback of that volume would say, even in the commercial office space, there's investment going in there
to repurpose, to reposition. And I like the opportunity for Allegion as we move through there from an
electronic standpoint. You go back 6 months ago, I was concerned about the return to office, and we're
going to have a lot of vacancies out there. Capital will go in and redefine that space, and it's going to be
good for our industry.

Brian William Ruttenbur
Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division

Great. The second question I have, just coming off of ISC West, and meeting with a lot of companies,
private and public. We see a lot of competition coming at access control with a total solution. White -- and
there's -- one of the trends I'm seeing is white labeling of hardware at a discount and integrating software.
So it's all about delivering a total solution, the hardware maybe name doesn't mean as much. And that's
what I'm hearing at least. So some of these companies that are investing large sums of money in this total
access control solution, that's what we're seeing. Can you address what you're seeing in the industry and
how you're addressing this threat?

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2021

Okay. In today's presentation, we try to emphasize our build, borrow, buy emphasis and our partnerships
with the mega techs. I certainly see this private labeling, white labeling phenomena. I would just suggest
the core part of our business has a level of connect -- of complexity and connectivity that I'll bet on over
the long haul. When you get into a complex business or a complex event space like you were at ISC West,
it's easy to look at this and say, okay, I can have a small offering of white label products. But when you
start adding code requirements, master key systems, the connectivity with an Apple, a Google, a Lenel,
the game gets a lot tougher.

Operator

The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just wanted to circle back to the Americas revenue guide for the year. You're embedding, I think, maybe
very low single-digit growth year-on-year in the second half in the Americas. Just trying to understand
what's embedded in that for residential versus nonresidential? And what sort of pace of slowdown of
residential growth you're assuming?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So Julian, just as a reminder, last year, as we're coming out of the pandemic and demand started
to surge for replacement demand on residential products, backlog accelerated channel inventories were
depleted. And so a lot of the revenue growth last year was channel fill, big box, retail, e-commerce, et
cetera. And so you're getting a tough comp, particularly in the second half as it relates to the residential
business. And so that's going to impact the comparability, particularly when you're looking at overall
Allegion Americas business. As we indicated, nonresidential business starting to show good demand,
a little bit constrained relative to the supply chain issues. But we'll start seeing some growth kind of
year-over-year. So it's really that the guide you have to take into account last year had a higher growth
component associated with channel fill related to the residential business.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Sure. But I guess I'm trying to understand, are you assuming that residential revenues are down year-on-
year in the second half or...

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

No, they're still increasing.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. That's just what I wanted to check. And then on the margin front, looking at -- yes, we keep
attacking it different ways, but let's look at it sort of second half margin year-on-year because I think
that makes more sense in terms of the information you provided in the 10-Q and so on. So it looks like
your second half operating margins firm wide may be down something like 100, 200 bps year-on-year
in the second half. Is the way to think about that, it's about 200 bps headwind from inflation net of price
productivity and then maybe another 100 bps headwind from investment spend. Are those roughly the
right orders of magnitude?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. And I would -- just a little bit more color on the price, productivity, inflation dynamic. Included in
that guide would include some of the effect of these bounce back costs that we've been highlighting. It

was much more pronounced in Q2, but you've got kind of some of those costs that continue in Q3, Q4. So
that's some of the pressure as well year-over-year.

The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.

Joseph Nolan

This is Joe Nolan on for David MacGregor. I was just wondering, could you talk about field inventory levels
in both the residential and commercial business? And then just how you expect the timing of the channel
restock play out?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

On the residential side, big box, our res pro partners, I think the restocking of that supply chain is
essentially complete. There is pressure on any type of electronic-related product. Again, which we're
navigating well, but that will be a problem that moves through in the next 4 quarters. On the commercial
wholesale side, as I talked about the bounce back in demand, I think part of that is wholesalers seeing
the confidence in the marketplace and restocking, but I think much of it's going straight through because
of the availability or really green light on small projects that were delayed over a continued period. So I
would suggest that the restocking of the wholesale and contract supply chain will be completed over the
next 2 to 3 quarters.

Joseph Nolan

Okay. And then also just on your education business, given the year ago pull forward in the timing of
seasonal maintenance into 2Q '20, was that a growth headwind that you experienced in 2Q '21 this year?
And do you think that becomes a tailwind here in 3Q?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Just state your question again, you broke up.

Joseph Nolan

Sorry. Just on the education business, given the year ago pull forward and the timing of seasonal
maintenance into 2Q '20, was that a growth headwind this year in 2Q '21? And does that become a
tailwind here in the third quarter?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would look at the opportunity in K-12 as part of the bounce back, but more a positive as we move into
'22 and '23. Americas is going to continue to invest in its K-12 infrastructure from a variety of reasons,
age, increased security, more automation, and Allegion will benefit from them. It's clearly a positive.

The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

For a while I thought I would have to use the word unpack in my question. I was wondering if there was a
memo that went out to use the term unpack, but that [Technical Difficulty]

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Oh, I'll take that, too. I guess the question is on pricing. Historically, your pricing has been fairly close to
that of your large competitor in North America. This quarter, they seem to be ahead of you. And I was
just wondering, is there a difference in approach to channel between the 2 of you? Or is just a matter of
timing, as I said, because the industry seems to sort of move in lockstep.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I wouldn't say they're ahead of us. My words to our leaders worldwide is use all tools required to
address the extraordinary inflationary forces. We were out with a normal Q1 price increase. We've added
surcharges on certain products, and we've announced a end of Q3 price increase, 2 price increases in a
year, and the other tools that we're using to mitigate price. I think the industry has been disciplined in our
stewardship of making sure that we respond to the incredible inflationary forces who work for us.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got you. Then the second question, as you and I -- I think I've asked this question a couple of times,
but as you face supply chain constraints, are you rethinking either your approach to your internal supply
chain, i.e., sort of more automation? Or are you sort of rethinking sourcing, any long-term impact from
sort of current disruption in the channel? Or you think once we sort of get rid of the bullwhip effect, things
go back to normal fairly fast?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I think the Allegion supply chain is always a strategic item as we think about positioning the business,
one. Number two, I'd point to our decrementals during the downturn. Our decrementals on a top line basis
was softer than any of the competition, meaning as the markets collapsed, our revenues were stronger
on those decrementals, and I would point to supply chain. Third is, I think, clearly, a lot of work going on,
I'd say, managing the complexity of what we do. It's everything from boards to grommets to casting. Part
of what the Allegion franchise is built on is managing this complexity. Our supply chain does an important
part of -- plays a critical part of that, but it's rethinking those partnerships, making sure that we've got
the availability of any type of part to be able to move it. We've made some pretty significant industrial
investments in automation. Those will continue. I think as we go through this, labor availability is going
to be in scarcity on a worldwide basis. And so automation investment, investing with strong suppliers and
producing in-region are key drivers for Allegion, Andrew.

Operator

The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just a quick question here on the margins. The -- if I take a look at the Americas margins and your
commentary around pricing for 4Q, I guess when we think about the sequential change in margins in the
Americas, is there kind of like embedded in your expectations that sequentially margins potentially step
down in 3Q because of these inflationary pressures and then back up in 4Q? Just trying to understand the
cadence a little bit better.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes. So you got it right. Q3 margin decrease year-over-year, much more pronounced than Q4. Q4 because
of the price increase and some further actions, still down, but improving, not as far down as Q2.

Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. All right. That's super helpful. And then I guess maybe just one -- maybe one broader question. I
know that you guys consistently get compared to your European peer in the U.S. But if we take a step
back and just thought about the industry as a whole and the potential consolidation in the locks market
in the U.S. Do you guys view the market as being fairly well concentrated today? Are there opportunities
to continue to expand either via M&A within the market you see future consolidation? Just curious around
your broader thoughts there.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I think over the last decade, this is an industry that's consolidated. I would suggest that that's not moved
at the pace that other industries have. So there's opportunities, half step adjacencies. I think the brightest
growth aspect for Allegion is in the seamless access technologies. Part of the corporate spend this year
is we're investing to try and better understand the future of seamless access and where it could be 5 to
10 years out because of our unique position. And my message here, the industry is going to continue to
consolidate it. But I believe through innovation of our unique position on the door electronics, your edge
device that it will continue to drive nice growth for Allegion.

Operator

The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Maybe just -- so first question is on investment. And I guess it's two part. So I guess, first, could you just
elaborate a little more on where you're making the actual incremental investments this year? And then
secondly, could you just talk about the pipeline build for future investments and how the paybacks on
those are kind of prospectively versus history? Are they the kind of same, better or worse? Just kind of
curious there.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, Tim. So the majority of the incremental investments would be centered around R&D, technology type
of investments centered around driving electronics, revenue growth and market segmentation, i.e., where
are the opportunities where we can expand our business and leverage our franchise globally. And so think
about that in relation to some of the things Dave talked about in terms of enhancing our partnerships,
to have broader connectivity into electronics seamless access ecosystems and solutions, very important
for the business going forward. So we're putting monies in those that I think will position us extremely
well for growth going forward and will help us continue to grow faster than the broader market is the plan
there.

Your question on ROIC, it's always been a really good payback, not only on investment, but on a cash
on cash basis. And good things to do that will position us in the marketplace for further growth. And
historically, you've kind of seen our revenue kind of trend probably a little bit north of our peer set and
would expect that to kind of continue given the level of investments that we're making to position our
franchise going forward.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I'd build on that a bit, Tim, to say we've had -- take out the pandemic, we've had 5, 6 years of double-
digit electronics growth. And clearly, the market moving that way. We've got, over the next 24 months,
a nice pipeline of connected products coming out that it will enhance specific investments in software
capabilities, what I call software stacks that enhance the partnerships that we talked about today. You
have to have the APIs, SDKs that allow our locks to work in our own ecosystem and work in the complex
ecosystems that may be present at a hospital, a college campus. We believe this differentiates us versus

one horse ponies that come in with a solution and an important part of our future growth. I'd add one
other is segmenting the market and understanding the future 5, 10 years out in multifamily, K-12, college
campuses and hospitals. We think we have an important role to play in our installed base, and this
connected environment will leverage Allegion's growth.

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

I just -- Tim, also just think about the movement in technology, how fast things are changing and being
part of a broader ecosystem where we can -- our products can seamlessly plug and play into a broader set
of solutions, very important. And so investments -- incremental investments will continue. I mean it's part
of our DNA in terms of how we think about accelerating growth. And things are moving quickly, and we
want to be a market leader in that segment.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

On -- in the [ deck, ] partnerships with the mega techs, which are important, partnerships with the
integrators like Lenel, our venture arm, I think you saw the announcement on Openpath, the sale to
Motorola Solutions, an excellent example of how we're playing that game and then continue investments
in the digital players that help drive our growth.

Timothy Ronald Wojs
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. No, I really appreciate it. It all makes sense. I guess the second question, just on maybe
bigger picture. Could you just frame for us how you're thinking about a recovery and maybe revenue
contribution from the specification business? So you're obviously seeing an uptick on the specification side,
but when do you think you could start to see that be a meaningful revenue contributor? Is that a full year
benefit next year? Or is it skewed towards the second half?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I think you'll see that really gaining some speed Q2 of next year and through the traditional construction
season. ABI's been up for 3, 4 consecutive months at really record high, 60. I think we were there for a
peak. It takes about 12 to 18 months based on the scope of those projects for us to really start seeing the
momentum.

Operator

The next question comes from John Walsh with Crédit Suisse.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Maybe just 2 follow-ups here. One, you had a little bit of a discussion there on K-12. You talked about
the age, the security, more automation. But one thing you didn't mention was stimulus. And just curious,
we're hearing that there's a lot of stimulus already been approved for that vertical. A lot of focus on HVAC,
but there is a big demand on the infrastructure side for access control. Are you seeing any of that benefit
yet? Or is that what you're kind of talking about might come through in '22 and beyond?

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

As we try and unpack the stimulus package, we certainly see access control, school security as a part of
that. Again, it's dominated, I think, by modernization, things that you talked about HVAC. We're going to
benefit as a result of that stimulus. I would also say there will continue to be a drive in the K-12 sector to
modernize. The average K-12 structure is 40 years old. Security threats persist and access into schools is

becoming more sophisticated because of people's edge device, electronic locks, and Allegion is going to
benefit from that.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. And then obviously, you've lived through several inflationary cycles. We could argue this one's a
little bit different. But can you talk about your ability to hold price when you come out of these inflationary
cycles, there's probably some regular pricing activity. I think you used the term surcharges for some
things as well that maybe those are a little bit more transitory and go away when inflation abates, but can
you just talk about your historical experience there, if we think about margin next year?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, sure, John. So historically, the price increases announced that are permanent in nature, stick going
forward, okay, i.e., even in deflationary periods, prices remain the same, and a fairly disciplined industry
here. We did announce some surcharges on particular products that are more heavy and steel-related
components. And those, of course, go away assuming that the price of steel comes down. But the majority
of our price increases are permanent price increase that we expect will stick going forward even when
inflation comes down.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

I would add to that, the majority of my industrial career in the electrical industry and now security, we
have as a guiding management principle, as our input costs go up, I expect to capture that plus. And
we're very driven on the inputs as well as the pricing systems here and it's part of our DNA. And it's never
been more important as we face inflationary pressures.

Operator

The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And maybe just a couple of loose ends here. A lot of ground covered. First, maybe a little shout out
to your international friends. Just wonder if you could give a little bit of color on how you're thinking
about the margins in the back half there, right? Usually, we start fairly low in the first half and step up
materially. I'm assuming from this kind of better run rate here in the first half, you're not expecting
the same magnitude of step-up, but I assume the margins are going higher. Could you just elaborate
on the trajectory there, the price cost dynamics in those markets collectively, and what, if any, other
restructuring benefits you have coming through?

Patrick S. Shannon
CFO & Senior VP

Yes, Jeff. So thanks for bringing that up. Outstanding performance by the international team, particularly
when you're looking at not only margin increase, but the top line growth. And that's been a key
contributor to the margin expansion there as well. But you may recall, if you kind of look at that segment
in isolation, they were probably out in front of this pandemic quicker in terms of reducing costs, managing
that side of the equation, restructuring programs that kind of went through both in Europe and Asia
Pacific. We also are seeing the benefit of the amalgamation of both the Asia Pacific and European
segments coming together as Allegion International. All that combined has really accelerated the margin
improvement year-over-year.

The restructuring actions, the benefits we saw in the first half kind of lap, if you will, beginning in Q3. So
you're not going to see the step up in margin expansion year-over-year. Seasonally, you know this, Jeff,
that the margins expand in Q4 for that segment, in particular, would expect the same seasonal increase,

ALLEGION PLC FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 22, 2021

but the year-over-year margin improvement, you're not going to see. There was some onetime benefits in
Q4 that are nonrecurring this year, bounce back in cost, higher inflation, these type of things. But the --
great performance first half. We would expect kind of continuous margin improvement going into next year
or 2. And so I really like what the team has done there, how they're executing, driving top line growth,
those type of things. Great performance.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Right. No, understood. And then just back to kind of the whole backlog top line calculus here. I guess
your guide essentially kind of indicates revenues in Q3 and Q4 will be similar to Q2, which is not atypical
for your business. But I guess I'm also hearing though that perhaps you're suggesting the top line is just
governed here by the supply and other constraints. Is that really the message that there kind of in normal
circumstances, there would be more upside into the back half, just unlocking this backlog, but just the
physical ability to get it out the door, whether it's your own factory or inputs from suppliers, just keeping a
lid on what you can actually execute on in 2021.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

You read that correctly. I think we've assessed, okay, what's possible here. We'll move that backlog
through. I think we are mindful of the constraints on our supply base. We're also, I think, grounded that
labor may be the tightest element in all of this and it affects our customers and suppliers. So you've got
to kind of take a stiff view at this when are people going to come back to work and availability improve.
We think that's a long-term problem. We think the culture of Allegion, how we run our business and the
strength of our supply chain, we'll do better than the competition in that battle.

Operator

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dave
Petratis for any closing remarks.

David D. Petratis
Chairman, CEO & President

Thanks for joining today's call. Allegion's future remains bright, and I'd like to leave you with some
key highlights of our call. Market demand is robust and has returned to pre-pandemic levels faster and
stronger than anticipated. This is extremely encouraging. Inflation has accelerated and there are industry-
wide supply chain pressures. These constraints are not unique to us, and we will actively manage both
of these dynamics. The resulting backlog we are building sets us up well for the remainder of '21 and
'22. Last, Allegion is stronger, more structurally sound as we continue to invest during the pandemic. As
a result, we are positioned well for profitable growth, and we'll continue to aggressively execute on our
strategy of seamless access. Have a great day today. Thanks for your attendance.
