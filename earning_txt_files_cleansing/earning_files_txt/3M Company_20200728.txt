3M COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M second quarter earnings conference
call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, July 28, 2020.

I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.

Bruce Jermeland
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2020 business review. With me
today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chief Executive Officer; along with Nick Gangestad and Monish Patolawala,
our Chief Financial Officers. As you may know, Nick will be retiring at the end of July. Monish joined the
3M team on July 1, succeeding Nick as CFO. Mike, Nick and Monish will make some formal comments, and
then we'll take your questions.

Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our
Investor Relations website at 3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Please turn to Slide 2.

Let me remind you to mark your calendars for our third quarter earnings call, which will take place on
Tuesday, October 27. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on Slide 3. During
today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about
3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and
expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent
Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our
predictions.

Finally, throughout today's presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial
measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachment to today's press
release. Please note we have provided segment and total company adjusted EBITDA reconciliations for
reference in today's press release attachments as part of our non-GAAP measures.

Please turn to Slide 4, and I'll hand it off to Mike. Mike?

Michael F. Roman
CEO, President & Chairman

Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy,
and I thank you for joining us. We continue to fight the pandemic from all angles to ensure the safety of
our employees, health care workers, first responders and the public.

In a highly uncertain environment, where economic activity was restricted by global lockdowns, we
executed well and delivered another strong operational performance in the second quarter. We posted
solid margins and robust cash flow while strengthening our balance sheet, innovating for our customers,
investing in the future and continuing our transformation. Our value model is strong, and we are taking
action on a number of fronts to lead through this crisis and emerge even stronger.

While there remains a great deal of economic uncertainty, we are seeing an improvement in sales trends
in July across all businesses and geographies as we start the third quarter. And Monish will provide
additional comments later in the call.

I am proud of how our team is leading through these unprecedented times, and I thank all 3Mers for their
tireless efforts to serve those who count on us. Please turn to Slide 5.

Our COVID-19 response starts with a steadfast commitment to the health of our employees. We have
robust safety protocols in our manufacturing plants and distribution sites, enabling us to effectively protect
our people while maintaining supply chain operations.

3M COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

For remote employees, we have developed a phased approach for their return to the workplace with
enhanced safety measures and emphasis on flexibility for individuals. We have had our colleagues
returned to the workplace in 2 dozen countries, mainly in Asia and EMEA, along with our global R&D
community. And we are adjusting based on government guidelines and the evolution of the pandemic
across the world. As we protect employees, we work around the clock to protect the safety of all people,
including health care workers and first responders. 3M is making and distributing more respirators than
ever before, though demand continues to far outpace what the entire industry can supply.

In the first half of the year, 3M manufactured 800 million respirators globally, with half distributed in
the U.S., primarily to Health Care and FEMA. For the full year, we expect to produce 2 billion respirators
globally, more than a threefold increase versus 2019. We continue to make investments and partner with
the U.S. Department of Defense and other governments to bring additional global capacity online.

We are also working with federal, state and local governments to deliver respirators where the need is
greatest. At the same time, we remain vigilant in fighting fraud and price gouging. To date, 3M has filed
18 lawsuits and removed over 7,000 counterfeit websites, protecting people from bad actors.

Beyond personal protective equipment, 3M Science is fighting COVID-19 in other areas as well. Our
membrane technologies help improve blood oxygenation procedures and our biopharma solutions support
the development of needed vaccines and therapeutics.

Earlier this month, we announced a collaboration with MIT on a diagnostic COVID-19 test that aspires to
make testing faster, more broadly available and less expensive. The project has received approval from
the National Institutes of Health, and we are working as fast as we can to develop a low-cost, highly
accurate device that can be mass produced.

I will now turn to our second quarter results on Slide 6. The financial impact of the pandemic remained
mixed across 3M during Q2. We continue to see strong demand in personal safety, along with other areas
such as home improvement, general cleaning and biopharma filtration. At the same time, we experienced
steep but expected declines in other end markets, including medical and dental elective procedures,
automotive OEM and aftermarket and general industrial.

Geographically, while organic sales in Asia Pacific declined 8%, we saw year-over-year improvement in
China, up 3% in the quarter versus down 11% in Q1. Organic trends in EMEA and the Americas remained
consistent throughout the quarter, both declining in the mid-teens each month. All in, organic sales
company-wide was minus 13%, with adjusted earnings of $1.78 per share. While growth conditions were
challenging, our operational execution was strong.

We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins to 26.5%, up 110 basis points year-on-year. In the second
quarter, we delivered $400 million in cost savings versus last year as we aggressively managed expenses
to offset COVID-19 impacts and associated restructuring. This cost discipline, along with effective capital
allocation, enabled us to increase our adjusted free cash flow to $1.5 billion in the second quarter. And
Nick will walk you through the details. Please turn to Slide 7.

Importantly, while we manage near-term uncertainty, we continue to advance our 4 strategic priorities:
portfolio, transformation, innovation and people and culture to deliver value for our customers and
shareholders. We finalized the sale of our drug delivery business in May, enabling us to focus more on
our core Health Care portfolio. We are encouraged that the benefits we are seeing from the new global
operating model we implemented this year, a significant step in our transformation. This includes our
new enterprise operations team, which is enabling us to reduce cycle times and improve the customer
experience. Nearly all of our plants and distribution centers are operational, and we have worked with our
partners to ensure consistency of supply.

Our new structure streamlines decision-making and allows us to adjust faster than ever to the external
environment, all of which help our customers. As just one example, one of our U.S. plants recently pivoted
to manufacturing hand sanitizer almost overnight, moving from formulation to production in less than 72
hours. In addition, we're accelerating our efforts on automation and robotics and introducing new digital
capabilities such as virtual selling tools to deliver on our promises to customers.

3M COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

At the heart of 3M is innovation and our ability to apply science to solve critical customer needs. We
continue to invest in R&D and drive innovations to solve big challenges like air quality, automotive
electrification and food safety. Just a few of our priority growth platforms, which are outperforming in
the markets they serve. For example, our air quality platform grew double digits in the quarter, as we
introduce new indoor air quality solutions through our innovation and increased investments in capital.

We are also finding new ways to engage our people, strengthen our culture and advance our core values.
We continue to step up our leadership in sustainability, and our annual sustainability report released
in May includes a comprehensive look at our progress. As part of this commitment, we are proactively
managing PFAS, guided by the principles of sound science, corporate responsibility and transparency.
For example, in March, we launched a clearinghouse to share research on testing, measurement
and remediation. A commitment we made at our congressional testimony last fall. You can find this
clearinghouse and all the latest information on PFAS on our website at 3M.com. In addition, we provide
regular updates in our 10-Q filings.

We are also fulfilling our commitment to comprehensive reviews of all 3M manufacturing operations
to ensure adherence to environmental requirements, company policies and our values. As we shared
previously, we continue to work with communities where we manufacture, along with government officials
and regulators, including the EPA, to advance our environmental stewardship.

Last week, we announced an agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management to
resolve matters related to previously disclosed PFAS discharges at our Decatur facility. This is part of our
commitment to address contamination at sites where we manufactured or disposed of PFAS. With respect
to PFAS litigation, we anticipate the earliest trial date will now be in 2021.

Beyond our environmental responsibility, we know we and others must do more to address injustice and
inequality. The death of George Floyd here in Minnesota was jarring for all 3Mers, especially our African-
American employees. At 3M, we stand for equity, fairness and social justice, and we will be part of the
solution by listening, understanding and then acting.

Based on insights from our employees and communities, we have 2 focus areas: first, we are identifying
the most impactful actions to accelerate inclusion and diversity within 3M. While we've made good
progress in recent years, we have much more to do. At the same time, we are working with other
companies on actions that will make a difference here in Minnesota and we've made initial investments
as part of these efforts. We are also working with stakeholders to develop a long-term plan to support
economic opportunities and development in communities of color, address the education gap and advance
social justice.

It is vital that companies step up to lead change to really make a difference this time. I am personally
leading these initiatives, and we will provide you with updates as we move forward. Please turn to Slide 8.

Before turning the call to Nick, I would like to make a few comments about our CFO transition. First, I
want to thank Nick for his many contributions throughout 35 years at 3M. He has been an outstanding
leader and a great colleague and has created tremendous value for our company and our shareholders. In
6 years as CFO, Nick's guidance has been especially valuable as he helped lead our transformation and our
work to optimize our portfolio and position 3M for the future. I wish Nick and his family all the best in the
future.

I'm also excited to welcome Monish to our leadership team. Most recently, Monish was CFO at GE
Healthcare, a $17 billion business. His experience leading health care and industrial businesses, along
with driving operational transformation, is already making an immediate impact for 3M. Monish is an ideal
fit for our enterprise and for our culture. And later in the call, he will make a few comments about our
perspective on the third quarter.

I will now turn the call over to Nick for the details on Q2. Nick?

3M COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9. Company-wide second quarter
sales were $7.2 billion, with adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion and adjusted operating margins of
19.6%. On the right-hand side of the slide, you see the components of our margin performance in the
second quarter. The impact of the pandemic was varied and numerous across the business and operations.
The biggest factor negatively affecting Q2 operating margins was the impact of the pandemic on global
customer demand, which resulted in nearly a 14% year-on-year decline in organic sales volumes.

In addition, during the quarter, we undertook restructuring actions, resulting in a Q2 charge of $58 million
due to the impact of the pandemic. These headwinds were partially offset by aggressive cost management
during the quarter, which reduced costs by approximately $400 million year-on-year. Also providing a
year-on-year benefit to operating margins is a restructuring charge in last year's second quarter. All in,
these benefits were more than offset by the decline in organic sales volume and restructuring actions
resulting in a 100 basis point reduction to second quarter margins versus last year.

Acquisitions and divestitures reduced margins by 80 basis points due to Acelity purchase accounting
impacts. Higher selling prices, along with lower raw material costs, contributed 70 basis points to second
quarter margins. And finally, foreign currency, net of hedging impacts, reduced margins by 10 basis
points. Overall, we effectively managed cost throughout the quarter in a very dynamic and challenging
global economy. And as Mike mentioned, we expanded EBITDA margins by 110 basis points year-on-year
to 26.5%. Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at earnings per share.

Second quarter adjusted earnings were $1.78 per share, down 16.4% year-over-year. Let me now cover
the items that made up our second quarter earnings performance. Similar to the operating margin
discussion on the prior slide, organic sales declines, productivity and other actions, collectively reduced
year-on-year per-share earnings by $0.28. Acquisitions and divestitures reduced second quarter earnings
by $0.07 per share versus last year, primarily due to the Acelity acquisition. Please note that this result
includes financing costs associated with the acquisition. Foreign currency, net of hedging, was a $0.05
per share headwind in the quarter. And turning to tax rate. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate was
20.7% versus 22.3% last year, adding $0.03 to earnings per share. And finally, average diluted shares
outstanding declined 1% versus Q2 last year, adding $0.02 to per-share earnings.

Please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet. As Mike noted, we delivered
strong second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year. This increase was
driven by effective working capital management, disciplined capital allocation, along with a $400 million
benefit related to timing of income tax payments, which will be paid in the third quarter.

Through the first half of the year, adjusted free cash flow increased to $2.5 billion versus $2 billion last
year as we continue to generate strong free cash flow, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our
business model. From a capital allocation perspective, our long-term strategy remains unchanged. Our
first priority is to invest in our business; second, maintaining our dividend; and lastly, flexible deployment
for M&A and share repurchases.

Second quarter capital expenditures were $379 million. For the full year, we now anticipate CapEx
expenses of approximately $1.4 billion versus $1.3 billion previously. This increase in our full year CapEx
budget expectations is primarily due to the pace of projects picking back up as economic activity returns.

During the second quarter, we returned $846 million to our shareholders via dividends. Share repurchases
remain suspended throughout the quarter given the continued global economic uncertainty. Our strong
second quarter cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to strengthen our capital
structure. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and reduced
net debt by $1.7 billion or 10% in the second quarter.

Please turn to Slide 12, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with
our Safety and Industrial business, which declined 6% organically in the quarter. Personal safety saw
strong double-digit organic growth, driven by continued unprecedented levels of demand for respirators
globally in response to the pandemic. The balance of the Safety and Industrial portfolio declined
significantly due to the global slowdown in industrial production activity during the quarter.

3M COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Looking geographically, the Americas declined 9% organically, with the U.S. down mid-single digits. EMEA
declined 1%, while Asia Pacific was down 4%. Safety and Industrial second quarter segment operating
margins were 23.8%, up 180 basis points, driven by continued strong productivity, cost actions, and
benefits from last year's restructuring.

Moving to Transportation and Electronics. Second quarter sales were down 19% organically compared to
last year. Our electronics-related business was down 1%, with strong growth in semiconductor, factory
automation and data center, which was offset by continued softness in consumer electronics, particularly
smartphones. Our automotive OEM business was down 44% year-on-year, in line with the 45% decline in
global car and light truck builds.

Commercial Solutions declined roughly 30% and while transportation safety and advanced materials
were down mid and high teens, respectively. Geographically, Asia Pacific declined 8%, while the Americas
declined 29% and EMEA was down 33%.

Transportation and Electronics second quarter operating margins were 19.7%, negatively impacted by
the 19% decline in organic sales, which was partially offset by cost actions and benefits from last year's
restructuring.

Turning to Health Care, which experienced significant pandemic-related challenges and disruptions across
the industry, declined 12% organically versus last year. Organic growth across much of our Health Care
portfolio was negatively impacted by the effects of COVID, which resulted in delays in elective medical
procedures and closed most dental offices around the world.

These impacts were most prevalent in our oral care business, which was down nearly 60%, and medical
solutions, which declined mid-single digits in Q2. Food safety declined mid-single digits as the business
was impacted by the closure of food processing plants during the quarter due to worker safety concerns.
A positive note, our separation and purification business grew mid-single digits. This business continues to
experience strong demand for biopharma filtration solutions in support of the pharmaceuticals industry's
research and manufacturing efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutic treatments for COVID.

Looking geographically, the Americas declined 14%, while EMEA and Asia Pacific each declined 10%.
Health Care second quarter operating margins were 16.8% or down nearly 10 percentage points year-
on-year. Approximately 2/3 of this decline was due to the significant reduction in organic sales, with
the remaining 1/3 related to the Acelity acquisition. Looking ahead, we expect both organic growth and
operating margins to improve as elective procedures return.

Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was down 5%. Organic sales growth
within Consumer was led by our home care business, up high single digits, along with home improvement,
which was up low single digits. Growth in these businesses was driven by strong customer demand for our
Scotch-Brite cleaning products and solutions, Scotch Blue Painter's Tape, Filtrete air filtration products and
Meguiar's car care products. Stationery and office and consumer health care both declined, impacted by
the stay-at-home orders and social distancing protocols, which resulted in many offices and schools being
closed across the world.

Looking at Consumer geographically, the Americas and Asia Pacific were each down mid-single digits,
while EMEA declined 10%. Consumer's operating margins were 23.2%, up 250 basis points on strong cost
discipline and ongoing productivity. That wraps up my review of the second quarter results.

Before I turn it over to Monish, I'd like to take this opportunity to make a few comments, given it is my
last earnings call. 35 years ago, I started my career at 3M right out of college. I'm humbled and grateful
for the many opportunities and experiences I have had throughout my career. And most importantly, the
many wonderful people that I have gotten to know, both professionally and personally, around the world.
In the last 6 years, I've been blessed to be the CFO of this great company and to lead 3M's global finance
organization. As part of my role as CFO, I have also had the opportunity to engage with many of you in
the investor community.

I have greatly enjoyed the many interactions with those of you who have covered and invested in 3M. I've
appreciated your support, input and feedback and I wish you all the best in the future.

3M COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

With that, please turn to Slide 13, and I will hand it over to Monish to discuss our thoughts going forward.
Monish?

Monish D. Patolawala
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. First, I would like to recognize and thank Nick, not only for
his 35 years of outstanding service to 3M, but also for his partnership, counsel and guidance over the past
month in helping me learn 3M and ensure a smooth transition.

Like Nick, I am humbled to be a part of this outstanding company. I have had great admiration of 3M and
its vast scientific capabilities to positively impact the world, including and across industry, health care and
consumers' lives. It's great to be a part of the leadership team and to lead the company's global finance
organization.

Over the past month, I have spent time meeting with leadership, key finance members and also
participated in strategic and operating reviews and discussions. While I've only been on the job for a few
weeks, this past month has given me a great opportunity to personally engage with our leadership team
and learn the company. I want to thank all 3Mers for their warm welcome.

With that, let me make a few remarks regarding our thoughts on the coming quarter. As we start the third
quarter, we are seeing sequential improvements in end markets, including automotive, health care and
general industrial. While the strength and pace of recovery remains uncertain, we currently are expecting
global economic activity to be stronger in Q3 as compared to 2Q.

Turning to our business. We are seeing a broad-based pickup in growth across our businesses and
geographies as we start the third quarter. With 1 week left in July, total company sales are currently up
low single digits year-on-year. With respect to respirators, we anticipate continued strong demand, which
we estimate will contribute approximately 300 to 350 basis points to company-wide Q3 organic growth.

As we did throughout Q2, we will continue to provide monthly sales information. Therefore, we will provide
an update on July sales once we have finalized results in a few weeks. From an operational standpoint,
though we anticipate some pickup in cost as sales growth improves, we are maintaining our aggressive
cost discipline, whilst also continuing to invest in future growth and productivity. Therefore, looking at
margins, we currently anticipate our third quarter adjusted operating income margins in the range of 20%
to 21%.

Finally, with respect to free cash flow, we will continue our efforts to drive improvements in working capital
and prioritize CapEx spend. Our ongoing focus on cash flow, along with disciplined capital allocation, are
central to enhancing our financial flexibility and strengthening our capital structure. While uncertainty
remains, we are confident in our ability to continue to execute on our priorities, respond to changes in the
marketplace and invest in future growth and productivity.
With that, I thank you for your attention, and we will now take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Congrats, Nick, on your retirement and enjoy. Well done. Manish, good luck to you.

Nicholas Gangestad;Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Scott.

Monish D. Patolawala
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Anyways, I -- 2 questions here. One, on the cost out, how much of the $400 million would you guys say is
kind of permanent, you can hold on to, versus the more temporary fashion?

Nicholas Gangestad;Chief Financial Officer

Scott, I'd say the vast -- the majority of the $400 million is temporary, that much of what we were doing
in second quarter was reducing expenses through disciplined holding down of expenses. There were some
other things we did of restructuring actions that we think -- that we know will benefit us going forward.
But the majority of this $400 million, we see as temporary spending reductions and not permanent
spending reductions.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Okay. And then as a follow-up, the July month-to-date, I mean, I know we're only -- we're not totally
through the month yet, close. But that seems pretty positive based on the sequential -- I mean, I wouldn't
have expected positive towards later in the year -- until later in the year. Is there -- can you give us a little
bit of color on that? Is there any particular snapback or inventory rebuild or back discretionary health care
has started up again, things like that, that perhaps is driving that growth?

Michael F. Roman
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. Scott, maybe I'll characterize it a little, really in line with what Monish said in his remarks. It's pretty
broad based across businesses and geographies. We are seeing positive growth in China coming out of
Q2, and that continues. But it's really broad based. It is related to some of the things you highlighted.
Elective procedures coming back. The automotive build rate sequentially getting better, still negative but
getting better. So we're seeing it. I wouldn't say we're seeing the signs of a snapback in the inventory in
the channel yet. But it's -- we're certainly early days benefiting from that broader improvement across --
really across businesses and geographies.

Operator

And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

3M COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

And I'll echo the thanks to Nick, and welcome to Monish. Maybe just a question on the adjusted operating
margin, first of all. So I saw the guidance of 20% to 21% for Q3. It is up slightly sequentially. But I guess
year-on-year, it's still a very heavy decline, maybe heavier even than what you had seen in Q2 even with
a better revenue trajectory. So I just wanted to try and understand if that's right, there's maybe a 3-point
decline in the adjusted margin year-on-year. And maybe what's driving that to offset the better volume
performance?

Nicholas Gangestad;Chief Financial Officer

Julian, yes, with the guide that we're putting out for third quarter margin, 20% to 21%. We've been
looking at it from a sequential perspective and seeing it up 50 to 100 basis points over where we finished
Q2 of this year. Now as you're doing and looking at last year, you got to remember, last year had some
one-off things benefiting that. We had a gain on the sale of a building that's included in that. We also have
the impact of Acelity. Year-on-year with Acelity, not in our third quarter results last year, but they're now
in there. Those are the 2 biggest things impacting the year-on-year number.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe my second question, if we look at the Health Care business, specifically, I
know the comments around improving margins in the prepared remarks. Maybe just put a finer point on
it, I suppose, in Health Care. Help us understand the pace at which the elective surgery-related businesses
are coming back. And did the comment mean that margins could grow even in the second half? Or is more
just a much narrower decline than what you've seen in Q2?

Nicholas Gangestad;Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Julian, I won't take the comments to say that we expect the margins to be up year-on-year in our
Health Care business. My comments there were in regards to compared to where we saw margins in the
second quarter, we anticipate those continuing to expand as we see elective procedures coming back
and our own volumes going up. And if I use oral care as an example, each month of the second quarter,
we were seeing improvement in our year-on-year growth rates in that. And we expect some -- that to
continue going forward. We're also seeing improvements on the month in our Medical Solutions business.
So we are seeing signs that these elective procedures are coming back, and we're seeing the start of that
later in the second quarter, early into the third quarter. And as that continues, we expect that to have a
positive impact on the sequential operating margins for Health Care.

And our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin, Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a question. As things improve for you guys, what do you need to see? What are the goalposts? Oh,
I apologize. Before I go into my question, I do want to thank Nick, and welcome, Monish. I apologize for
skipping that. Nick, good luck and thank you. And Monish, welcome. Apologies for that. So just going back
to capital allocation. What do you need to see in terms of things getting back to normal? To go back to
share buybacks, to go back to looking at M&A, what does it take? What do they goalposts?

Monish D. Patolawala
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks for the question. The way we look at it is, we have said before, it's an extremely uncertain
environment. So for us to look at the, what you call stability, we'll have to figure out what our end markets
look like. When you think about a big end market, whether it's health care, automotive, and personal
safety. So until we see that stability, it's just going to be really hard for us. So I would call those as the
goalpost. And of course, how the coronavirus cases play out in the world will be other big factor in this
and how the economy start opening up. So those are just some of the macro indicators that we'll have
to look at before we feel comfortable. And that's why we're taking this day by day and we're going to

continue providing you monthly guidance on revenue. And then as that stabilizes, I think we'll be in a
better position to have a stronger view on capital allocation.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So when you stop providing monthly guidance, I should expect buybacks? Sorry, that was a joke. And
another question. You guys have some of the strongest presence in China of anybody we cover. And we've
been reading about possible supply chain disruptions related to sort of Yangtze River flooding. Are you
seeing any impact on your customers in China? I mean, I know where you guys are. But are you seeing
any impact from flooding on your supply chain? Or are you making any contingency plans? Just trying to
figure out how real that thing is.

Michael F. Roman
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. And Andrew, through the entire COVID experience, we really have validated the model that we've
had around the world. And as you know, we manufacture in China a majority of what we sell in China.
So we really are closely connected with the supply chains there. I would say, at this point, we don't see
an impact from the flooding. I mean, we're watching it closely. We're staying connected to our customers
as they see interruptions as if it worsens or their businesses are interrupted, we will. We will certainly
adjust in the supply chain, but at this point we don't see a material impact on the China results. We're
seeing fairly broad-based improvements really across electronics and industrial and transportation markets
leading the way. Like the U.S., the elective procedures in health care are a little slower to recover, but
it's fairly broad-based in that growth that we saw in Q2. So not at this time, but we'll stay close to it and
update as we go.

Operator

And our next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Can you just discuss where you stand on some of the cost actions for second half? I know you said you've
got $400 million out in second quarter, but maybe just discuss what you're getting in second half. And
then how that temporary versus structural kind of plays into next year, just assuming flat sales, for
example, even though they probably won't be flat. Just what you see kind of as temporary and structural
now, just an update there.

Monish D. Patolawala
Senior VP & CFO

Sure, Steve. So as Nick mentioned in his prepared remarks and the prior question, most of the actions
that were taken in the second quarter were temporary in nature. We have taken some structural actions
through a restructuring charge but -- as most of them were temporary in nature. I would say we're going
to continue our strong cost discipline that we're doing. But at the same time, as the economic recovery
starts coming back up, we are going to see investments in both growth and productivity as well as some
of the timing items in 2Q will play back out in Q3 and Q4. So that's our current view right now. And as
I said, uncertain environment, but depending on which way the world plays out, we are ready to act
whether in both investing in growth and productivity at the same time.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So I guess that sounds like for -- I guess, that sounds just pretty -- performance next year will be pretty
consistent to kind of normal incremental margins on growth with maybe just the 2Q temporary actions as
kind of the key item to call out.

Senior VP & CFO

So as of right now, I would say that, Steve. But again, as I said, let's see how the world plays out and
we'll act both on growth and productivity as required. But for Q3, again, looking at the cost actions, just
to reiterate, we are looking at -- as sequential revenue goes up, margin rate is going to go up to 20% to
21%, which is 50 to 150 bps better than Q2.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Nick, good luck, and Monish, good luck with your new role as well. I just wanted to just to touch quickly
on July versus June. I mean, I wasn't on the whole prepared remarks, but what caused the big snap in --
it looks like mid-ish teens declines in June on a daily basis and then strapping into positive growth in July.
And is that positive growth, is that inclusive of acquisitions? Or was that purely organic? Just wondering
what changed between the 2 months.

Michael F. Roman
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. So the growth was all in sales, Nigel. So it's both acquisitions and organic. We are -- I would say
we're -- that broad-based view of businesses and geographies. It's adding up everywhere a little bit.
That's what's making the difference. And we're seeing that -- we're seeing demand come back. There's
a lot of, I think, a lot of optimism that we were seeing economic recovery at the end of second quarter.
And we saw pretty consistent organic growth across the months in the quarter. We're seeing it come
through now in July. So it's just -- I would say the timing of it and that broad-based across businesses and
geographies is adding up to improving trends. I'm encouraged by what I see. It's still early days in the
third quarter, but we're off to a good start, and I think it's a start of a trend in those markets is the cause
of it.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Yes. I'd be curious if there's any channel impact that's causing that. But my follow-on question is really
on Health Care margins. And we saw -- I mean, I think the best way to think about this is on an EBITDA
basis, and we saw sequentially EBITDA margins declining from 20% down to 24.1%. And I mean,
obviously, volume took a big step down in 1Q versus 2Q. So is that just purely a volume impact that we're
seeing there? Or are there some mix impacts that we need to figure in as well?

Michael F. Roman
CEO, President & Chairman

Nigel, before I give it to Nick, maybe just a comment about the channel at the end there. We did see
some strong point-of-sale as we came through second quarter. So there was expectation that sell-in would
follow. That's probably contributing some of it, but we aren't seeing a big, as I said earlier, a big snap back
in the channel, but there is -- has been stronger point of sale, so that's also contributing.

Nicholas Gangestad;Chief Financial Officer

And Nigel, to your question on the EBITDA margins for health care. And yes, we're seeing that down and
your presumption is correct. What we are seeing there is almost all volume related when we look at it on
an EBITDA basis because then we're pulling out the impact of the Acelity purchase accounting impact. It's
almost all volume related. And then, again, as we see volumes coming back up, we expect that to abate
and come back to more normal operating margins for our Health Care business.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Thank you to Nick, and welcome to Monish.

Monish D. Patolawala
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, John.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Wanted to go back to the Q3 margin guidance. I was trying to calculate the year-on-year decline if I
make adjustments for the flame detection gain last year, the property gain, which you kind of sized in the
prepared remarks last year, and it seems like the year-on-year delta actually gets worse in Q3 versus Q2.
So I wanted to know, one, if that math was right and if -- or if we missed something there.

Monish D. Patolawala
Senior VP & CFO

So the way I look at it, John, I think the reason we went to incremental quarter-over-quarter sequential
is because it's so hard to do the math year-on-year. There were some gains last time as well as we've
got the impact of the Acelity acquisition this year. And that's why I would just request that focus on the
sequential, and that's where we are showing margin improvement of 50 to 150 basis points as we go
forward as volume starts getting better.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up, thinking about price raws for the back half year, price ticked up. I
was just curious where you're actually seeing an acceleration in getting price maybe by the segment units
because we already have it by the geography.

Nicholas Gangestad;Chief Financial Officer

Yes. So we're at 50 basis points of price growth in the second quarter. And we don't foresee that having a
material change in the second half of the year. What we've been experiencing for price growth both for the
first and the second quarter, we think, is a pretty indicative of where we'll be for the total year. So John,
there's really not any big trend change going on there that -- to highlight. It's been a very stable number,
and we think it will remain stable.

And the next question is from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie

Monish D. Patolawala

Same here, Joe.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So maybe just my first question, maybe following up on Nigel's question on health care margins. So if we
were to take out the Acelity acquisition from 2Q, what were the core decrementals in 2Q in Health Care?

Nicholas Gangestad;Chief Financial Officer

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

3M COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

Yes. Joe, the core decrementals in Health Care, once I pull out Acelity, then we're in 60% or a little higher
than 60%, which is not unusual given the makeup of our cost structure in Health Care. So once I pull out
Acelity, that's -- then we're in that range.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then just, Nick, just following up on a comment you made earlier. So none of that is
mix related, like the elective procedures isn't exacerbating that decremental. It's just basically volume
oriented, and that's it?

Monish D. Patolawala
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. When we look at a mix impact, we have pluses and minuses. It really nets out to very little change on
our overall Health Care margin.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. All right. And then maybe one follow-on question. Just going back to the comments around capital
deployment and when you could potentially get more aggressive with a buyback or M&A. The question
I have is like, how are you thinking about your balance sheet and your leverage going forward? There
are a lot of moving pieces, clearly, from a PFAS perspective. And so I'm just wondering whether you're
thinking about your leverage in a different way when we start thinking about you getting a little bit more
aggressive in the future.

Monish D. Patolawala
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. So I would just start by saying the hallmark of 3M has been its strong capital structure, and our
plan is to continue doing that. Deleveraging has been a priority for 3M, and we're going to continue that
journey. I think the pace of deleveraging will depend on how economic activity recovers. And also our
ability to continue driving strong cash flow and control our working capital. So that's what I would just say
for the time being is our current view. And to reiterate capital allocation, our first priority has always been
to invest in the business. It's R&D, organic growth, best return right there. Dividend is our second, which
has been a big hallmark of 3M. That's our second priority. And then M&A is third, and then share buyback
would be our last priority. So that's the way we are looking at it right now.

Yes. Just 2 business-related questions for me, if I could. First, on electronics, can you just provide a little
more color on what you saw there? It sounds like kind of a tale of 2 markets, right, consumer electronic
versus the other buckets. If you can give a little more color on what you saw in the quarter in those pieces

3M COMPANY FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2020

CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. Jeff, electronics for us was down 1%. And as you said, it was kind of a mix of different stories.
There was strength in semiconductor data centers, factory automation. Those were all up double digits
for us. Those have been part of our focus on where we invest for growth in electronics. It was offset by
softness in consumer electronics. The broader transportation electronics was impacted more heavily by
automotive, and I would say, our commercial solution business. But in electronics, the strength were in
those categories. We see those trends continuing. Semiconductor fabrication continues robust growth.
Consumer electronics still soft as we start third quarter. But the benefit of being in those higher growth
segments has -- gave us some strength in electronics in the quarter.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Then secondly, unrelated, on the consumer side, obviously potentially a very peculiar back-to-school or
maybe we don't even have back-to-school this year. What is going on in retail in terms of planning for this
channel fill, that sort of thing? And what are you expecting in the third quarter?

Michael F. Roman
CEO, President & Chairman

Well, our retail partners are planning for back-to-school. And as you said, there's a lot of uncertainty
around it. It's another one of those things. That's almost day by day. We are -- we built a little bit of
inventory even as we went through the first half in anticipation of back-to-school where we see that being
something that is going to add to some of the growth as we move forward. But it's a lot of uncertainty
around how it's going to play out. The strength in consumer for us has been around home improvement
and our cleaning products. Stationery office had been declining as schools were closed, of course. We're
hoping to see an uptick in demand as schools open, but that still remains to be seen.

Thanks, Deane.

Deane Michael Dray

I'm not surprised that air quality is one of the priorities for 3M. You've got such a big presence on the
residential side with Filtrete. Where and how do you see opportunities on the commercial building side on
filtration as people start venturing back to work? Are there new products that you're expecting to launch?

Michael F. Roman
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes, Deane, you hit it. Our innovation in our -- really the core of what we do in filtrate has been focused
on residential, both indoor air quality, and I would say, residential HVAC together with room air purifiers
being part of that. And our innovation goes into the Filtrete filters that are part of that. The commercial
side is, while we contribute some of our nonwoven technologies, it's not a big part of our air quality
growth. It's one of those areas that -- it's still nascent in how the innovation is going to make a difference
there. We work in our innovation on opportunities there. But when we talk about the outlook for the
strength in this area and the growth that we're seeing in our priority growth platform. It's really in that
residential side of the marketplace.

in terms of product launches and contributions?

Michael F. Roman

Yes. It's still -- the heart of 3M is our innovation, it comes through in those new product launches. We
highlighted a little bit the benefit we're seeing in these priority growth platform, but it's much broader
than that. We continue to launch new products. And like everything else, we're adjusting in the middle of
COVID, prioritizing where we see market opportunities. And I would say, in some cases, you see in our
CapEx delaying some of the investments as we see slowness in markets. Now we have plans for robust
new product launches in the second half of the year. It's going to be still a critical part of our growth
driver. So it's -- it doesn't change. We just have to adjust to the market opportunities. And I would say to
the pace of investment as we go through the rest of the year.

Thanks, Andy.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So just focusing on Safety and Industrial for a second. The margin performance in the quarter was strong.
Can you give us a little more color in terms of what led to the margin improvement in the quarter. Is the
big increase in mask sales actually helping mix? Is it realignment that's now helping that segment? And
would you expect to see this kind of performance we saw on Safety and Industrial moving forward?

Monish D. Patolawala
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Andy. In total, the fact that our revenue was down year-on-year, we're not seeing a benefit margin
in our Safety and Industrial business from the combination of the higher respirator sales in the lower
sales and the rest. That -- those we look pretty much as a push to us. So the 180 basis point margin
expansion, some of that's coming from that $400 million of cost actions that we're doing that Safety
and Industrial had its share of that. But we -- this was also a business where we were taking actions
last year in restructuring. So we're -- the lack of repeat of that expense, plus the positive benefit of that
restructuring, all of those things in combination led to that 180 basis point margin expansion. It's really
not a mix or a respirator story. And then going forward, we do see continued margin expansion potential
in this business going forward. Possibly not on the same scale as what we saw here in regards to the
margin guidance that we provided. But it's still a business where we see upside on the margin on a year-
on-year basis.

And then just focusing geographically again. China seems to be continuing to improve, but Japan looked
worse and Latin America looked expectedly weak. So can you talk about Asia and some of the other
emerging markets? It seems like China continues with more of a V-shaped recovery for you guys. Is that
what you're seeing? And then why did Japan turn down in Q2?

Michael F. Roman
CEO, President & Chairman

Yes. And Andy, we are seeing that recovery in China. And as I highlighted earlier, it's really across Safety
and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, leading kind of the improvements there as we move ahead.
Health Care is still slow as elective surgeries, even -- or elective procedures come back in China as well.
So we are -- we see that, as I highlighted, continuing as we start the third quarter. Japan was down 12%
in the quarter, really seeing declines in safety, industrial and consumer, transportation, electronics as well.
So it's a broad-based slowness there. I think we're seeing that across geographies that there's kind of a
sequence to things that -- you've seen the earlier recovery in China, then you see EMEA, Americas and
Japan, other parts of Asia, kind of going through kind of a step behind that, and we saw some of that in
Japan as we went through the second quarter.

Nicholas Gangestad;Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Marcus.

Markus M. H. Mittermaier
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. If I can maybe come back to just the monthly data. Sorry for that. Mike, Nick, when we spoke intra-
quarter, we talked about the sort of billing day adjustments that we would have to make in May and June.
And if I do that arithmetic, I actually see June down significantly more than May was, which surprised me
a bit. And then correct me if I'm wrong, but did you say July, the low single-digit number, was that all-in?
Or was that organic? Maybe let's start here.

Nicholas Gangestad;Chief Financial Officer

Yes. When we look at on a per billing day sales, from April to May to June, we saw an improvement each
of those months. However, that's a normal pattern for us. It's a normal pattern as we go through the
second quarter that May and June sales per billing day goes up. And we saw that again this year. So in a
year-on-year growth comparison, what we saw on a per billing day was very comparable about the same
growth on a sales per billing day in May as what we saw in June. What we're seeing now in July is now a
more noticeable direction change, where on a sales per billing day and on an absolute basis, we are seeing
it up low single digits versus where we were in July of last year.

Markus M. H. Mittermaier
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Maybe I'll come back to that after the call just to make sure. And then on the interim content order
that you mentioned with ADM on the -- in your prepared remarks, is that something that you have already
provisioned for before? Because in the special items, if I look at it, there were no sort of litigation-related

provisioned for in the past?
