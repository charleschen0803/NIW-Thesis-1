Well, thank you, Paul, and good morning
I will begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2016, which was a great year financially, strategically and operationally
Let me start with the financial results
We had another strong year with ongoing EPS of $2.21 in 2016 compared with $2.09 per share in 2015. This represents an ongoing EPS growth rate of 5.7%, which is at the upper end of our 4% to 6% growth objective
This was our 12th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our earnings guidance
We also raised our dividend by 6.3% to $1.36 per share in 2016. This was the 13th straight year we've increased our dividend
Turning to strategy, in 2016, we introduced our steel-for-fuel strategy
Because of the strong wind resources in our service territories, we have a unique opportunity to invest in renewable generation in which the capital costs can be offset by fuel savings
As a result, we are planning to invest about $3.5 billion in renewables over the next five years
So, let me give you a quick update on some of our major initiatives
The Colorado 600 megawatt Rush Creek wind project was approved by the Commission last year and is progressing as planned
Rush Creek is expected to go in service in 2018. In Minnesota, we are seeking to add 1,500 megawatts of new wind generation, which reflects an RFP for PPAs or Build-Own-Transfer projects, and our own self-build proposal to develop 750 megawatts of wind generation
As part of the RPF process, we received proposals from 17 bidders with 95 proposals for almost 10,000 megawatts of wind generation, featuring a combination of PPAs and Build-Own-Transfer projects
We've analyzed the bids, developed a shortlist and are negotiating with the developers
We believe our 750 megawatt self-build wind proposal is competitive and will complement the RFP portfolio
We plan to follow recommendation with the Minnesota Commission later in the first quarter, and we expect a decision in the summer
We also continue to make progress on the $1.5 billion of undefined renewable projects, which are included in our capital forecast
We're working with various stakeholders and are in advanced discussions with site developers about adding 500 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts of wind generation at SPS
And we expect to share further details later in the year
Finally, last year, we entered into a wind turbine supply agreement with Vestas, which provides us the flexibility to develop up to 2,500 megawatts of wind generation
This agreement allows us to secure 100% of the PTC benefit and maximize the fuel savings for our customers
It's all part of our steel-for-fuel strategy
We have strong wind resources with high capacity factors in our service territories
We have support for the development of renewable projects from state policymakers, interested stakeholders and our customers
And we've taken timely actions to secure the full utilization of the wind Production Tax Credits
As a result, we expect the fuel savings on wind projects will more than offset the capital cost and that's what steel-for-fuel's all about
We also had a strong year in operations
In 2016, we successfully completed the construction of a 200-megawatt Courtney Wind Farm in North Dakota, and we did it on time and under budget
This was our first wind project in which we were the general contractor and is further evidence of our ability to develop, manage and construct wind projects
While the project took 15 months to complete, you can watch the entire construction process in a three-minute time-lapse video posted on our website
I think it's a fascinating video and I encourage you to check it out
We had an excellent operational and safety year in 2016 and I want to take a moment to thank all of the Xcel employees who work hard throughout the year and always put safety and customers first
We had several challenging storms in our service territories recently and we responded with industry-leading efficiency
One example was the wave of intense storms that hit our service territories over the Christmas weekend, resulting in more than 100,000 customer outages
Our crews braved frigid temperatures and unusually icy conditions to restore power safely and quickly so that our customers could enjoy the holidays
And just recently, ice storm Jupiter ripped through Texas, impacting 58,000 customers, many of them in small towns and remote locations
Once again, our field crews and supporting teams worked around the clock to restore power to our customers in a timely fashion
Finally, Minnesota legislators recently introduced a bill which would allow us to build a natural gas combined-cycle power plant at our Sherco site
We originally proposed this plan, along with the addition of renewables, as part of our Resource Plan, which enables the early retirement of two coal units at the Sherco site
The Minnesota Commission acknowledged the capacity need and the benefits of siting new generation at the existing plant site, but elected to defer a decision to a later date, which would require us to file a Certificate of Need
The bill was driven by legislators who are concerned about the loss of jobs and tax revenue and wanted to expedite the decision process
It's important to note we have provided extensive justification for the plant, and the Commission will still need to approve cost recovery for the power plant
The bill has passed the Energy Committee in the House, but will require approval in both the full House and Senate, along with approval of the Governor
We expect to get final resolution later in the year
If the bill is not passed, then we would plan to file a Certificate of Need
Please note, this facility is not included in our capital forecast, and any potential capital investment would likely occur after 2021. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and he will provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, as well as a regulatory update
Good morning, Ali
Well, Ali, as you know, we've been – our ROEs in 2016, we didn't make a lot of progress over where we were in 2015, and that's primarily due to lower authorized ROEs
So, when I look at 2017 and when I look at 2018, we will continue to, I think, close that gap, albeit on a lower authorized ROE
We'll primarily do that through entering into multiyear plans
We expect approval in Minnesota of our multiyear plan and we expect we'll have another multiyear plan in Colorado
We'll combine that with our cost initiatives, and I think where that'll put us in 2018 is probably in the low 9s as far as blended utility ROEs
And so, we'll make steady progress towards that
Well, the lag is – you've cut into the lag significantly under the multiyear plans
It's just that it's at a lower base rate of 9.2%
So, I don't have the exact number
But I think we've probably got, what, about
Yeah, I don't think the quarter is indicative of where we think trends will go
We are seeing good customer growth, Ali, in Colorado and Minnesota and other jurisdictions
That growth we are typically going to keep under the decoupling mechanisms either in place or proposed
You put it all together, though, and we think the long-term trend's that zero to 0.5% growth
Thanks
I don't know if I heard the first part of your question, Julien
So, could you repeat that again?
Well, I mean, if we get the legislation that could happen fairly quickly
It is, we do – our latest update says it's progressing very fast and it could be to the Governor by the end of this month
A Certificate of Need we would be filing later in the year
And we've got Chris Clark, who's the President of NSP, when would that get done most likely, Chris?
And so, Julien, that's why the legislation is being proposed because the constituents at Becker, where the Sherco site is located, are worried about tax base loss, and they want to preserve as many jobs as possible
And as an aside, we've been working very closely with those stakeholders and driving other forms of economic development to the region as well
So, our plan has always been about pragmatic decarbonization
But we're also very respectful and understanding of the communities that are impacted and trying to minimize that impact
And our proposal to the Commission did just that
And again, I think our legislators like to just move it along a little quicker
As your last part of your question
The expenditures, and I think that would be roughly $800 million
That would occur post-2021 and would be consistent with the shutdown of the units, which I think take place in 2023?
Yes
Well, I think it's a combination
Our rate base growth is in the upper 5%
So, I mean, we're clearly focused on executing on what we have embedded in our capital plans
That would be the proposal here in Minnesota
It would be developing specific projects, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to cover that $1.5 billion of renewables in our CapEx program
So, if you execute on that, you execute on the – getting the settlement on the multiyear plan in Minnesota, you get another multiyear plan in Colorado
Then our cost initiatives should improve the ROE, as I mentioned
And you put all that together, and I think it would bode pretty well for our EPS growth rate over the next five years
Well, there's a lot of execution that goes with that
But that would certainly be what we'd be shooting for
Well, I'll let Bob give you some details, Jonathan
But I mean, I think most of those are just truing up for where we landed in 2016. That said, we did have a holdco debt issuance at the end of the year
So we will pick up a little interest expense associated with that
But we believe it's very manageable
And I can just tell you that our outlook on our ability to land guidance really remains unchanged
So, Bob, I don't know if you want to add any color to that?
Right
I think, based upon the robustness of the bidding, I think we're looking at 1,500 megawatts
We have a 750-megawatt self-build proposal, as you know
Our pricing is very competitive with that, and we've also seen competitive PPAs and competitive Build-Own-Transfer
So, it leads me to believe that, at the end of the day, we'll have ownership opportunities for 750 megawatts, potentially some upside there, but at this point, that's what our assumption is
Yeah
I got a cold, but I'm feeling good about the RFP process
Hey, Travis
Thanks for that question, Travis, because I think it's a really important thing to talk about
I actually think that it strengthens our Resource Plans and what we're trying to accomplish, because we've always been about approaching carbon reduction from a pragmatic standpoint
I mean, steel-for-fuel is a great example of that; never losing sight of customer affordability, never losing sight of reliability, not being really interested in running massive science experiments
And so, there have been times, despite our environmental leadership, where we've been critical of some public policies and other things, which we didn't think it was the most pragmatic, efficient way to get things done
So, I now think there's more opportunity to rally around our plans, which have always been pragmatic
And that's in Minnesota, that's in Colorado
And I think you continue to advance the ball there, because it just makes economic sense
And by the way, the economic sense is what we'd be reporting to you later in the year about what's taking place in SPS where that would be driven by economics
So, it's a little counterintuitive, but I actually think it makes what we've been proposing that much more appealing
In what state?
You want to take that, Chris?
Okay, thank you
Correct
Thank you
Hey, Stephen
Good morning
Yeah
I mean, that's a good question, Stephen
I do think we have to be careful that we don't try to give model specific, quantifiable, this is what we'll do and blah, blah, blah, because post 2021, I mean, I think you're going to have so many variables that – first of all, I think, as Bob said, we're in the early innings
And disruption with border tax adjustments, I mean, it just leads me to believe that if tax reform happens, we'll be talking – and we're talking about it this time next year, it will be a lot different than what we're talking about now
That said, yeah, I mean, it does create headroom, and that's a good thing
And we certainly have a lot of investment potential to invest in a grid
We have some grid investment initiatives
But you know that our approach has always been to make sure that we don't invest so much that it starts to make our prices rise more than an acceptable level
So, we've always throttled that back
And that's one of the reasons why we concentrate on steel-for-fuel, because it doesn't raise prices
If you create the headroom, then you can push the throttle down on CapEx, specifically as it relates to the grid
I will say, though, and Bob mentioned it in his remarks, that I am working with EEI and my colleague CEOs to convince federal legislators that our industry – while everybody thinks it's unique, we truly are unique, and I don't think the long-term trade of receiving bonus depreciation in exchange for non-deductibility of interest, which is a permanent difference when you get to the regulatory rate-making arena, is a good trade for customers or shareholders
Obviously, industry and Xcel would adapt
And I'm optimistic that we'd get the right kind of tax reform and the economy will grow and we'll all benefit from that
But I do think we need to be careful to try to give exact quantifications long term
I'd rather just talk about the trends that we see and what we like to see differently
Yeah
So, we would make the proposal, I think, in the spring
Is that right, Marvin? In the spring of this year
The Commission would then take up to 12 months to actually approve it
And we've calculated that all into our construction schedules, et cetera
So, it all would be put together in time to enjoy the 100% value of the Production Tax Credits
No, there isn't a formalized RFP process at SPS
So, we are working with site developers and, as I mentioned, we're in late-stage discussions on how that would all work
But this would be our ownership
Thank you
Hi, Chris
This is Ben
It doesn't change that strategy
We know Jeff Ackermann very well, and I think he's going to be a great Chair
Wendy Moser, she definitely knows the business
So, I think we're quite optimistic about what the new Commission looks like
We also had some changes in Minnesota, and I think those changes are going to be productive and constructive
And we look forward to working with the Minnesota Commission as well
So, I think they're positives
Well, the timing is, we'll file in the spring of this year, and we will be asking for a multiyear on the electric side
Marvin, what are we going to be asking on the gas side?
Okay
Yeah, I mean I think – I don't know if we'll get multiyear or not
I think that depends on the negotiations
We do think that these cases are set up to settle
And so, that will be the primary driver
We would also like to see the gas rates in effect before the winter heating season
Thank you
Okay
You got me stumped on that one
Anybody around the room? Marvin, you got it?
Well, I would say, we're not seeing it now, but we certainly have saw in past years
And that's why we kind of had some of the issues we had a few years ago, as we pushed through a significant amount of capital, particularly associated with the relicensing of our nuclear plants
The bottom line is, I think it's very difficult to justify more than a 2% to 3% increase in rates
That's why we've been very cautious as we – you heard in my remarks before, we have a lot of money we can spend in the grid, and we'll go as fast as our customers and our regulators want us to go
And typically, that means a kind of an inflationary-type pace of rate increases
This is why we're so excited about steel-for-fuel, because it pays for itself
But I absolutely – but we're very mindful of that, and our capital plans respect that
You're welcome
Hey, Andy
Good
It would start to give details around that $1.5 billion
Are you talking about the – the upside I think that you're referring to would the $1.5 billion of renewables that we didn't have specifically identified projects for, Andy
Is that what you're talking about?
The only thing that we weren't – that we had to – we were confident in, that's why it was in the forecast, but that we had to actually solutionize, if you will, was the $1.5 billion
Everything else is pretty much identified
Well, I think, Andy, every time we have significant changes, either to the upside or the downside, we're always going to take a look at what that means for our long-term growth rate and update accordingly
And so, as you get more time and more certainty, and certainly what you're talking about, it would be execution, as I mentioned, and we'll take a look at it
And we'll take a look at if there's any tailwinds that – or headwinds, rather, that might have surfaced as well
So, look for us to – we continue to review that long-term growth rate
And if it needs to change, we'll change it
Well, I mean I'm not going to get specific on the timeframe
We just continue to look at what's happened and what we think will happen in the future
Well, I appreciate that, Andy, because you're right, it is
And again, I think, as I've said before, our rate base growth is going to increase
But when you have things like steel-for-fuel and the pace of rate increases is modest
And that's really important we think to long-term success
It sounds like you like our story, Andy
We appreciate that
We'll keep working on it for you, promise
All right
Good morning, Paul
Well, this is Ben
Yeah, we've been working closely with, like I mentioned, other CEOs in the industry with EEI, the trade group, as you know
And so, yeah, we've had some preliminary discussions, but I would emphasize the word preliminary
I mean, this is – I think there's a long way to go with tax reform
And again, I think when we're talking about tax reform a year from now, we'll be talking about something that looks, I believe, a lot different than what's on the table now
I mean, it's just – our industry is impacted
We think there is a way to address that
We think normalization might be that pathway
But when I think of other industries, the retail industry, et cetera, there is major potential disruption
So, I'm not – I really think we'll have – I'm optimistic about tax reform, but I think it will probably look a lot different than what we're talking about today
And I do think the Senate is going to weigh in, and we've heard that
Well, I don't think – if you read the commentary from the key members of the Senate, I think they're saying that they appreciate what the House has done, but they're going to have their own version of what tax reform should look like
I mean, it's early
I think you'll see it – you'll see the House version get passed
Then the Senate will take up what I believe will be their own version, which, my personal opinion, and based upon conversations we've had, will look a lot different than the House version
We haven't even talked about transition rules
And I think there'll definitely be transition rules because of the potential disruptive nature
So, I think Bob said in his remarks, give us a couple more quarters and let's see how things go
Things are moving fast in this administration
But I really do think this to get done, unless you try to jam it through in a budget reconciliation process, and even then I think you'd be hard-pressed to get a majority of senators voting on that
I do think this is going to take some bipartisan work
And I certainly hope it is a bipartisan product, because I think that's better for the country, in my personal opinion
