Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year '21 Earnings Release
Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Paul F. Adler
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Nick, and thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas' Executive Chairman
of the Board of Directors; Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2021. After our commentary, we will be happy to
answer questions.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-
looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's

to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss.
I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.

I'll now turn the call over to Mike Hansen.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Thanks, Paul. Our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue was $1.84 billion compared to $1.62 billion in
last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 13.3%. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, were $2.47, an
increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions,
divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was
11.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services
operating segment was 13.7%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment
declined 6.8%.

Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $859.1 million compared to $707.8 million in last
year's fourth quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 310 basis points to 46.8% for the
fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 43.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20.

Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percent of revenue to 27.4% in the fourth quarter of
fiscal '21 compared to 30.9% last year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 of $356.4
million increased 71.8%. Operating margin increased 660 basis points to 19.4% in the fourth quarter of
fiscal '21 compared to 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating income
was affected by many items caused by COVID-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable
and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense.
Excluding these items, the fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. All of these items were
recorded in last year's selling and administrative expenses.

Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was 19.4% compared to 20.4% last year.
The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the impact of stock
compensation. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $267.7 million, an increase of 85.2%.
EPS was $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow
remains strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.5x debt to EBITDA at May

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

31, 2021. On June 1, 2021, $250 million of debt bearing an interest rate of 4.3% matured and was repaid
with cash on hand. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and our first quarter of fiscal '22 to date, we purchased $979 million
of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. On June 15, 2021, Cintas paid shareholders $79.2
million in quarterly dividends.

For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, revenue was $7.12 billion compared to $7.09 billion for fiscal
'20. EPS for fiscal '21 were $10.24 compared to $8.11 for last fiscal year. Revenue and adjusted EPS have
grown 50 of the past 52 years.

Fiscal '21 free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital
expenditures, was $1.22 billion, an increase of 14.7% compared to last year. For our fiscal '22, we expect
our revenue to be in the range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of
$10.35 to $10.75.

Please note the following regarding our guidance. Our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be in
the range of 19.5% to 20.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% in fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate
negatively impacts fiscal '22 EPS guidance by about $0.85 and EPS growth by about 800 basis points.
Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform.

We remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a steadily
improving economy, absent any economic or pandemic-related setbacks. For financial modeling purposes,
please note that there are no workday differences when comparing fiscal '22 to '21. Both fiscal years
contained 66 days in the first quarter, 65 in the second, 64 in the third and 66 in the fourth quarter.

I'll now turn the call to Paul for commentary on the performance of each of our businesses.

Paul F. Adler
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thanks, Mike. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and
servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and
other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our
customers on [ raft ].

Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion compared to $1.27 billion last year. Our
Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 410 basis points to 47.7% for the
fourth quarter compared to 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter, driven in large part by lower production
and service expense as a percent of revenue. While some inflationary pressures increased certain costs,
these were more than offset by increased revenue from businesses reopening or increasing capacity as
COVID-19 case counts fell and restrictions on businesses were reduced.

Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of
first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue
for the fourth quarter was $186.9 million compared to $196.3 million last year. First aid fourth quarter
revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's fourth quarter, in response to the onset
of the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment sales surged. Also, the first aid cabinet service
business was not impacted until late in last year's fourth quarter when business restrictions became
widespread. As a result, the division posted a 21.9% organic revenue growth rate in last year's fourth
quarter.

The first aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 46.1%
last year. The difference in gross margins is due to revenue mix. As we guided last quarter, less personal
protective equipment was sold in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. However, as a percentage
of total division revenue, personal protective equipment revenue was still a significant percentage. While
profitable, personal protective equipment revenue has lower gross margins than the first aid cabinet
servicing business. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially as the cabinet servicing business
continues to grow and gets closer to the pre-COVID percent of total division revenue.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All
Other revenue was $181.9 million compared to $152.3 million last year. The fire business organic revenue
increased 22.4%. Gross margin improved 70 basis points.

Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue growth rate was 6.2%, and gross margin increased 280
basis points.

I'll now turn the call over to Todd for our final prepared remarks.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Paul. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results that conclude a fiscal year of
significant accomplishments, including the following. We help keep our customers' place of business clean,
safe and ready for the workday by providing essential products and services. We procured hard-to-find
and potentially life-saving items such as face masks and gloves, provided hygienically clean health care
scrubs and isolation gowns and developed services, including hand sanitizer dispensing, sanitizing spray
services and disinfecting wipes.

Our Net Promoter Scores reached an all-time high because we consistently deliver for our customers
by providing needed products and services and being flexible with service agreement terms during the
pandemic. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500, climbing 31 spots to rank at #410 on the
2021 list. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies.

We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. We paid down debt, reducing interest expense. We
increased the annual dividend 10.2% and changed from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend to
return cash to shareholders more timely. We've increased the dividend 37 consecutive years. Also in fiscal
2021 and up until today, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $979 million.

As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our inaugural environmental,
social and governance, or ESG report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing
humanity and supporting the communities where we do business. And in addition to these many
accomplishments and despite the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we grew our
fiscal year revenue and adjusted EPS.

I can't thank our employee partners enough, and I'm so proud of their truly impressive achievements.
The Cintas story is one of growth. We have grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 50 of the past 52 years.
The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful long-term financial formula is organic
revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits, double-digit earnings per share growth, significant cash
generation, improved deployment of excess cash to further generate strong shareholder returns.

Our prospects for continued growth are great and a result in part from a strong value proposition and a
vast total addressable market. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get ready for
the workday. Examples include scrub rental to hospitals and dentists; hygiene supplies and services to
professional services firms; floor care services, including walk-off mats and mops to retailers; first aid
products to hotel and restaurant kitchens for cuts and burns; fire protection services to facilities managers
and universities; and personal protective equipment to city maintenance and sanitation departments.

The renting of health care scrubs and isolation gowns is indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity.
Plus, we are so much more than a uniform company. More than half of our revenue is from facility
services, including hygiene, floor care items such as walk-off mats and dust mops; cleaning tools like
microfiber mops and towels; first aid cabinet services; personal protective equipment; and fire protection
services, including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms.

Our total addressable market is the 15 million to 20 million businesses we don't currently service.

Every business, goods producing or services providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness or
compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Additionally, the COVID pandemic ushered in a greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of
noncore activities. Significant opportunities for new revenues continue to exist because of the need of
businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will
remain healthy and safe. The new services we launched, including hand sanitizer stand dispenser service
and sanitizing spray service, have a long runway.

Cintas consistently invest in technology to support growth. Our recent implementation of the SAP
enterprise resource planning system provides benefits in 3 main areas. One is operational efficiencies. Our
route drivers utilize personal route computers, which are similar to a cellphone, to access data and process
transactions real-time. Also, SAP enabled us to have visibility to laundered plant stockroom inventories
across our operations, helping improve profitability via the sharing and reuse of revenue-producing assets.
And the technology helps us improve working capital, be it tighter management of supply chain inventory.

The second benefit is data analytics and enhanced business reporting. These result from having the
order-to-cash cycle all in one system. SAP enables us to analyze, process and extract information from
extremely large data sets, helping us target penetration, cross-selling and pricing opportunities.

And the third competitive advantage is improved customer service. Through SAP, our customers can pay
bills and communicate with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We expect the ease of doing business will
help us improve customer retention. Also, customers can order products and services via SAP, resulting in
improved turnaround time and faster realization of product and service revenue.

I want to say a few more words regarding ESG. From the start of our company in the Great Depression,
the Cintas business model was wholly based on sustainable practices, wash and reuse. We have a great
corporate responsibility story to tell. We will continue to expand our ESG reporting and are excited about
issuing our next report this year.

And finally, I'd like to say thank you on behalf of all Cintas employee partners to Scott Farmer for his
18 years of service as Chief Executive Officer. Under Scott's leadership, the company's revenue grew
from $2.69 billion in 2003 to $7.12 billion in fiscal 2021. Scott successfully led Cintas through years filled
with challenges, changes and opportunities, including the Great Recession, our largest acquisition, the
COVID-19 pandemic and the integration of SAP technology across the organization. We thank Scott for his
service to the company as CEO, and we are grateful that he remains as Executive Chairman.

Scott D. Farmer
Executive Chairman

Thank you, Todd. And I'd like to take this moment to thank all of my Cintas partners across the company.
I'm proud of our many collective accomplishments, including the innovative products and services that we
provide our customers as well as the tremendous dedication of our employee partners without whom we
wouldn't be successful.

Our company is in a position of financial strength with the strongest and most experienced management
team that we've ever had executing a proven strategy that has allowed our continued success even
through the recent pandemic. It's been a true honor and privilege for me to have led this company as
CEO for the last 18 years. And I'm as excited about our future as I've ever been, and I look forward to
watching this leadership team steer us to continued success in the future.

Paul F. Adler
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Wittmann with R.W. Baird.

Andrew John Wittmann
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. Scott, congratulations on a great run. It's been a pleasure, and we look forward to still having you
associated maybe when we come to Cincinnati next time.

Scott D. Farmer
Executive Chairman

You bet. Thank you.

Andrew John Wittmann
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. So I guess getting on to business here a little bit, and maybe this is for Mike, there's been a lot of
focus on inflationary factors. And what I heard here on your prepared remarks and in your release was
that it sounds like you're getting good operating leverage, but I was just hoping you could drill in and talk
about some of the key factors you've talked about in the past. Certainly, labor is one that's come up a lot
broadly across the street. You've talked about some other things like health care travel. And others are
mentioning merchandise costs. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of those key buckets
and talk about the offsets that you have baked into guidance because it looks like your margin guidance is
flat to up slightly. And so I was just kind of hoping you could talk about some of the moving pieces inside
of that as to why you feel like you can offset some of these headwinds that might be creeping in.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Sure. I'll begin, and certainly, Todd can jump in. But as it relates to guidance, you're right, Andrew.
The implied margins would be at the low end of the guidance, flattish to at the high end, up around 70
basis points. So a pretty good range. And you've heard us talk a lot about we've made some really great
progress. We made some difficult decisions through this pandemic, and it'd be a shame to go backwards in
this. And this guidance is suggesting that we don't intend to.

And so how do we think about this inflation? Certainly, labor, as you mentioned, Andrew, is a big
component of our cost structure. And the really good news for us is we've been working on the labor rates
for some time, so this isn't something that is catching us by surprise. And over the last several years,
we've been increasing the labor rates. And so certainly, the labor environment is a difficult one from the
standpoint of the supply of -- people hiring has been a little bit more difficult. But we don't expect that the
increasing wages around us is really going to be a significant issue. We've been working on that for years
and don't expect that to really be that difficult for us as we move into the future.

Scott D. Farmer
Executive Chairman

And I would add that, that includes last fiscal year. We raised the wage rates of all of our hourly people
in our distribution centers, offices, production, all of our service, frontline service personnel. So we don't
have a big catch-up as a result of that. I know there are other businesses out there that froze wages in
the pandemic. And because it was a year, they might have a catch-up to make, and we don't have that. So
I'm happy to say that. But I don't think that so far, we've seen issues where the labor rates are going to
cause us significant problems, but we're more concerned about what happens to our customers as a result
of this. And so we'll be watching that very closely.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

CEO, President & Director

Andrew, this is Todd. It's a great question. We're in a good staffing position. We like where we are there.
We like the fact that we've been addressing this subject over the course of a number of years. And as
Scott pointed out appropriately, even in the peak of the pandemic last year, we were committed to staying
the course and do the right things and taking care of our hourly partners to -- because we knew that we
could see things coming, right, and we're committed to it. So that's important to us.

Certainly, other input costs are cost of goods. And our supply chain team is working harder than ever, and
they're doing a great job in managing through that process to get us the goods that we need to make sure
we're servicing our customers, which we're doing a great job at, and to manage our cost structure from
that standpoint. And -- but we like the spot we're in, and we anticipate getting, hopefully, some leverage
on the additional revenue that we bring in.

We've done such a great job and took such a big jump forward from fiscal '20 to fiscal '21 that, as Mike
stated, it will be a shame to go backwards, and we're focused on going forward.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

And Andrew, maybe I'll add a couple of other items. You saw that energy was 30 basis points higher in
our fourth quarter than our third quarter, about 40 basis points year-over-year. We've built that kind of
increase into our guidance. And certainly, there is room within our guidance for larger increases than that,
but something that we'll keep our eye on. We are -- we constantly are working on improving efficiencies,
productivity levels, routing. And those things will all have positive impacts.

From a material cost standpoint, the good news is many of our rental items are amortized. So when we
see increases in costs, they generally tend to take a long time to make it to our P&L, and they must --
they have to last for a while so that they bleed in over time. And so obviously, we've got a great global
supply chain Todd talked about, and they adapt.

And so when we see inflationary pressures, we look for opportunities to adapt to that new environment.
And I think, over the course of the last year, we've talked a lot about our supply chain. They've done a
great job, and we anticipate that they'll continue to do a very good job.

Now having said that, there are a lot of challenges in the supply chain and in hiring that we've talked
about. And we're not immune to inflationary pressures. They are all built into our guidance. But the other
thing is, we haven't increased our pricing for 2 years, right? And -- but we certainly believe that, that is
an opportunity for us. As we move into this new fiscal year, we have selectively started to do that in some
areas. Pricing is local for us. It's customer-by-customer decision. And where we believe it makes sense,
we will do that. And so that is certainly something that is available to us when we believe that the cost
pressure is warranted. Again, all of that is built into our guidance, which assumes not just keeping the
great leap forward that we made in fiscal '21, but even continuing to improve upon.

Andrew John Wittmann
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

That's really helpful. I just -- my one follow-up is just trying to get a sense of the reopening benefits that
you're getting or expecting at a sequential basis. How much is left after the May quarter and into June? Is
there still businesses that are closed for you or substantially closed where the revenues are so de minimis
that they might as well be considered closed? Or on a sequential basis, are you starting to feel like things
are fairly normal here, June, July time period?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

So Andrew, Mike talked about pricing being a local subject. Reopening is a local subject as well. But for the
most part, most businesses are back. Certainly, Canada has been a little slower to come back because of
vaccination rates and government effect impacts there. But nevertheless, in general, most businesses are
back.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Now are they back at the levels that we think they will be in the future? No, and we're committed to
helping them with our valuable products and services to help them be prepared as their employees come
back and their customers come back so that they can be -- they can compete in the marketplace. So
hopefully, that helps.

Scott D. Farmer
Executive Chairman

I would add -- this is Scott. I would add that we think that Canada will be in the position that the U.S. is
sometime the end of the summer with reopenings, but they're on a steady pace heading in that direction.
The biggest issue that we have is that businesses are open, but there are, what, about 7 million fewer
people employed right now than there were pre-pandemic. And so there's a lot of room there. And I think
as federal unemployment benefits subside in, what, September, we hope to see that our customers that
are open will be able to get themselves back to full staffing, and that will obviously benefit our business.

Operator

Moving on to our next question, we'll go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

So I was just hoping you could help us with the kind of cadence of organic growth by segment. There's
still obviously a lot of uncertainty potentially out there, so thank you for giving full year guidance. But I
was just hoping if there's anything to call out in terms of modeling the growth rates of the segments.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Manav, this is Todd. So I think you've seen through our guidance, we expect a range of 5.8% to
7.2% from a growth rate. When you think about -- obviously, the rental redivision is our, by far, our
largest division, so that will be in that range. But we expect that all of our businesses, meaning the other
businesses, fire, first aid and our direct sale business, will all be high single-digit growth businesses in
this fiscal year. So we feel very positive about all of them, and I look forward to growth in each of those
businesses.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Yes, I think we might see a little bit of bumpiness in the first aid business. You saw that their revenue was
a little bit lower. Growth-wise, they had a decline in the fourth quarter. They had such a strong year last
year, particularly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We may see a little bit of bumpiness through
the year, but it's a great business. It's improving. We're seeing the recurring business and the mix start
to turn back to where we like it. And so that's just throughout the year, maybe a little bit of a different
performance than we're used to seeing from a steadiness perspective.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. And then if I can just ask around capital allocation. I mean the buyback was a
pretty big number, the $900-plus million that you talked about. Can you just help us understand that in
the context of the M&A pipeline and what we should expect going forward?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So our commitment is still #1 priority is to invest back into our business to grow the number of
customers we have and grow those customers and invest in our infrastructure. Our second one is to invest
in M&A. And we are very focused on M&A, active in that area, and it's a big push for us.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

And then third, if there is -- consistent with what our approach has been in the past, if there is capital that
is in excess of that, then we'll return it back to the shareholders in the form of increasing dividend and
repurchase of the stock as appropriate.

Paul F. Adler
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Manav, this is Paul. And I was just -- wanted to add that we're so fortunate to have such a strong balance
sheet. The cash flow is so strong. We did that buyback, and our leverage is 1.5x, as we mentioned in
the script. So fortunate to be in a position where what we do with the dividend and the buyback doesn't
preclude us from M&A or any other activities because of the strength of the balance sheet.

Operator

And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.

Andrew Charles Steinerman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

When you frame fiscal '22 revenue growth, could you just talk about some verticals here? Which verticals
do you think will be above the average growth of the guide? And which verticals might take longer to
rebound or maybe they're just kind of slower-growth verticals?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

So Andrew, this is Todd. As we look at the business, the -- certainly, the hospitality business is -- you read
about it in the papers, right? You hear about bookings, whether it's airlines or hotels, et cetera. That is a
vertical that we think will be quite positive this year.

The health care vertical is going to continue to be strong for us. Hospitals are catching up on voluntary
type of procedures, which is helping that. And we have a very attractive value proposition in both of those
areas as well.

Education, government are both -- we expect to be quite strong for us. There was a -- the mix of
business, I think, you will see will be different in those areas, less PPE and more focused on more of a
traditional type of approach that we've had in the past. But those key verticals are all positioned well. And
if you think of them all, they're all positioned quite well, hospitality probably the best.

Andrew Charles Steinerman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Are there any slower-growth verticals? Or really, it's a rising tide here?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I would say I don't -- none come to mind where I would say, yes, a slower type of growth. It's just --
we're kind of a rising tide is the best way to put it.

Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.

Ryan Patrick Gunning
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

It's actually Ryan Gunning filling in for Hamzah. My first question, just around the fire protection business.
And if you could just talk about the competitive dynamics there and any opportunity for larger-scale M&A
in that business kind of similar to what you did with the medical and the first aid side?

CEO, President & Director

Yes, Ryan. This is Todd. We like our position in the fire business and really like the fire business. There,
we understand the -- how to go to market and how to make attractive margins in that business, and
we're investing. We're investing in M&A. We're investing in infrastructure to make sure that we're able to
service all of our customers. And we have a national offering in that business, some via subcontracting.
But nevertheless, a very attractive national approach. And we're positioned well.

How we -- our culture, our infrastructure, how we execute puts us in a good spot. And there's good
momentum in that business. There was -- when you think about it, right, it's all -- legally, you have to
have that -- those products and those services. But nevertheless, there was some pent-up demand in it
from repairs, right? So if you think about someone comes through and looks at your fire equipment, and
there are some items that need to be repaired. During the pandemic, people weren't so anxious to spend
money on those types of subjects and -- but as we're coming out of it, we're busy in that area for many
reasons. But one of which is some pent-up demand on repair, which is great business for us.

Ryan Patrick Gunning
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then switching over. Could you provide any kind of visibility on like how much of
your sales you consider today as pandemic, like nonrecurring versus recurring and how you kind of define
that?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Great question. So when you think about, let's call it, PPE items that were really pandemic-related,
they are still at levels elevated from pre-pandemic, but we do not expect them to repeat at the levels
that they were in fiscal '21. So if you think about our guidance, we think we would be -- with the PPE that
doesn't repeat, if it has -- if it does repeat, then we would be in the -- on the high end, above 8% from
an internal growth rate. So think about it that way, about how much is -- will not be repeating that we
don't expect to repeat, which kind of demonstrates the mix of business is going to be back much closer
to traditional. And there's some real good momentum there to get to the growth rates that we've guided
towards.

Operator

And our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

In the uniform rental segment, can you talk a bit about sales rep productivity trends and how the pipeline
is performing, especially moving through the quarter and entering fiscal 2022?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

George, I'm glad you asked about that. I have been so impressed by our sales organization, the creativity,
the flexibility, the urgency, the intensity about which way they go about their jobs and how they have
adapted to a crazy environment. And we try to work very hard to position them with great products and
services so that people very much want to take their calls.

And so we like where that's heading. The mix of business is obviously changing, but it's getting back to
much more traditional, George. And -- but there is a strong audience for the -- our sales partners and
then in whom they're calling on, partly because there were some items that you -- when people were
going through the pandemic, they said, "Hey, I can't make a decision on uniforms right now, but I need
some critical products to help my business run." We provided those critical products and services and it's
positioned us, now that it's closer to businesses getting back to normal, where they say, "Okay. Now I'm
ready to talk about those types of items."

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

So all that is positive for us. As we went through it, folks didn't realize that we had all the products and
services that we do. So that opens some doors, and we're continuing to operate in those doors to help
improve our business.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

That's very helpful. And then switching gears to health care and hygiene. Those are very strong categories
over the past year. Can you describe what kind of performance you're expecting structurally from those
health care and hygiene categories, not just in fiscal 2022, but really looking forward?

And then diving into PPE, you talked a little bit about normalization there in first aid mix going back to
pre-COVID levels over time, which has higher margins. Just talk a little bit about that evolving mix as well
and the implications for growth and profitability.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Yes, George, I'll start and Mike, Scott, Paul, if they want to jump in. We've spoken in the past about
hygiene, cleanliness, all those subjects that the pandemic has done for those subjects what 9/11 did to
security 20 years ago. And so what we're seeing is there's a greater focus on the health of employees,
health of patients, health of guests, students. And hygiene is a big part of that. So we see that as
something that will be elevated into the future. And we think that's good for society. That's good for our
business and good certainly for all those individuals. So we think that's going to be something that's
elevated, hopefully, in perpetuity.

As far as PPE normalization, there is -- there was a breakneck pace to get PPE last year because folks
couldn't keep their doors open in certain cases, couldn't work. So there was some real peaks last year.
That is certainly less. We expect this year the variants, the delta variant, I think, brings a bit of a wildcard
into that, which we're not going to try to predict. But nevertheless, as you see, as we go throughout the
year, you will see much more normalization. You'll see more people using our traditional cabinets, first aid
products, hands and cabinets as we say, and PPE will be more moderate.

Now just keep in mind, we've always been in the PPE business. We've always provided these products
and services. It's just they were elevated. We will continue to offer them. But as more people get back
to work in offices and machine shops, and in government and education, there will be more people that
will be consuming, from a first aid standpoint, our traditional types of bandages and tablets, et cetera. So
hopefully, that gives you a little color.

Paul F. Adler
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

And George, this is Paul. I just wanted to -- you mentioned first aid specifically, too, so I just want to
make sure we provided enough clarity there. That business, as Mike said -- alluded to, it's in a transition
period where, to Todd's point, so much PPE was provided. We seized the opportunity to come through for
our customers and provide thermometers and masks and visors, et cetera. So it's an outsized percent of
the revenue. That will transition, as we've been talking about the last couple of quarters.

What I want to make sure everybody understands is that first aid business is getting back to that more
reoccurring revenue stream with that cabinet service business, which we are very excited about. And to
think about a 9% or a high single-digit type of a growth rate for first aid in fiscal '22, that's coming off a
huge growth rate with a lot of PPE. So still a strong performance.

And what I want to make sure people don't miss is that, in order to drive a high single-digit growth rate
in '22, with PPE declining, that cabinet service business is growing very strongly. And what that will do
then is improve the margins going forward for the first aid business in fiscal '22. And we probably won't
get back all the way to pre-COVID levels in terms of margins in first aid because, just like many of our
businesses, it's a lot of small transactions. There's some momentum that has to build. But definitely, the
margins will continue to improve through the year as we get back to servicing those cabinets.

Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.

Toni Michele Kaplan
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I know you talked about the margin guidance earlier in the call and addressed the inflation impacts, but
I wanted to see if you could provide maybe some additional detail around which business lines you're
expecting to see the most strength from a margin perspective.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Well, Toni, I would say all of our -- we expect all of our businesses to perform very, very well. And in order
for us to be able to guide in the way that we did from about flattish to up 70 basis points, we're going
to need good performance out of all of our businesses. And that translates into very good incremental
margins, especially in our rental business. It's certainly, as Paul just described, it means that we're going
to see some nice improvement in our first aid margins as we see a bit of a mix shift. We expect continued
good performance in our fire business as I think we mentioned 22% organic growth in the fourth quarter.
We've got some great momentum, and we'll get some nice leverage as we move into the year.

And then certainly, our direct sale business, those margins I would expect, from a percentage standpoint,
to really increase nicely as we see those -- see the revenue start to come back, that will allow us to get
a little bit more efficient and certainly be able to leverage our infrastructure in that business. So we're
looking for margin -- good margin performance in all of our businesses all contributing to that guidance
range, margin improvement and all contributing to a real healthy 20% to 30% incremental margins.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Toni, the -- obviously, we're guiding towards all of our businesses growing. Incremental margins, 20%
to 30%. But when you think about it, obviously, the mix is going to change in all those businesses. And
each of them sold, with the exception of fire, there was some PPE. And so there's -- we'll get back to more
traditional type of mix. And that and the leverage on the additional revenue is going to help us.

Toni Michele Kaplan
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

That's great. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the 15 million to 20 million businesses that
you don't currently service. Could you just talk about the recent industry outsourcing trends? Has that
-- have you seen that accelerate or flatten? And can you -- how do you go about reaching out to those
businesses? Is that an initiative, a big opportunity for you any more so than historically? Just how should
we think about the opportunity?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Toni, the outsourcing trends continue. That has been positive. In addition, the focus on bringing
manufacturing back to the United States and Canada, we think, will be a positive, just that's obviously in
the early innings. But both of those, we think, will be positives for our business.

As far as reaching out, we have a significant investment in our infrastructure. And part of that
infrastructure is in our route base, and part of that is in our sales organization. So that is a -- that's a
significant investment.

You've probably also seen -- I hope you've seen some of our investment in mass media that we're
leveraging. Because we think it can pay dividends for that infrastructure. And the #1 thing we hear from
customers and prospects, frankly, is, "Hey, I didn't know you did that." When that -- that is a product or a

service that they didn't realize that we provided. So we're trying to leverage that and get the message out
and to give a little air cover to our infrastructure.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I wanted to check in on the health care opportunity, which I know has gotten a lot of attention on recent
calls. We haven't talked about it a lot yet today. You previously stated that -- I think that the vertical could
expand from kind of 7% of sales today towards potentially 10% of sales over the next several years. But
I know things are changing rapidly these days. So with another 3 months under your belt, I'm curious if
those expectations have changed at all in either direction.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Tim, this is Todd. I'll start. We don't see momentum slowing down in that area. Again, hospitals are
getting a little bit back to more normal operations on how they run their business. And our value
proposition resonates with them. We've talked often about the various products and services that we
provide, scrubs being a big one, isolation gowns, but also cleaning products to help them provide a
healthy environment. So there's a whole lot more focus on health and welfare now.

Obviously, in the health care business, because of what they do for a living, there's always been a major
focus on providing an environment that allows for high patient satisfaction. That was not only in health,
but also in image. So it -- when you think about what they need, it's a great vertical for us and the
products and services we provide. And there's a long runway there. We're providing products and services
to help institutions that -- I'd like to think you'd be impressed by the name of -- the list of people we do
business with. So who's who in that business. But nevertheless, we're not nearly as penetrated as where
we can be, should be and will be. So we're very much in the early innings on that vertical still.

Timothy Michael Mulrooney
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Okay. Great. And just switching gears. I apologize if you already addressed this, but how did energy costs
impact the results this quarter? I don't know, maybe year-over-year, sequentially or however you want
to present it. But can you also talk about your expectation for energy cost that's built into your guidance
maybe for your fleet, but then also for your production plans?

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

Tim, our total energy costs for the quarter were 2.1% of revenue. That's up 30 basis points from the third
quarter and that's up 40 basis points from a year ago. So we did certainly see some increase within the
quarter. Our expectation is that those will remain elevated during fiscal '22, up at those levels, maybe
even a little bit higher. So that's what we've got incorporated. Most of that increase being price at the
pump. So our gas and our service, our routes. So that's what we've got in the guidance.

And our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess on revenue, first, I have one clarification and one question. I just wanted to clarify. So high single
digit for first aid. I heard that, and then I heard some discussion of the tough comps and I think the term
bumpiness. Is high single digit the right number for the year, but maybe declines in the near term as

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

you get through the toughest period of comps is not out of the question? Is that a fair statement on that
business?

And the question then on revenue. On the rentals business, right, the long-term growth rate has been sort
of in line with this guidance. You've got easy comps. You've had sequential improvement throughout last
year. The fourth quarter had quite strong growth. And I guess I wonder why you wouldn't be positioned
to grow faster than the historical long-term trend given those factors in this year. Is -- did the hygiene
business within rentals have an outsized benefit from PPE that rolls off? And is that a drag? Or are there
other factors beyond just your normal conservatism that might be weighing on that business?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

So Gary, as far as the first aid, yes, think about it as high single digits for the year. As Mike stated, Q4
last year, Q1 -- excuse me, Q4 of '20 was a huge growth rate for the first aid business as was Q1. So the
comp from right now were really big. So as the year goes on, the PPE will -- the comp will lessen. And as a
result, our growth rates will be better in that business. So the bumpiness that Mike spoke about is simply
the PPE comps in the early portions of this fiscal year versus last.

As far as the rental, yes, as we mentioned in the past, there's PPE in that -- in our results from last year
in rental as well. And again, just going back to our total guidance if the PPE would repeat, that we do
not believe it will, this year, then you'd be into the -- the number would start with an 8 as far as internal
growth.

So how far into the 8s? I really don't know. But nevertheless, we'd be picking up a heck of a lot of basis
points in growth if that PPE repeated. So it's a headwind. We're proud that we provided the product to our
customers. Our customers really valued it. It opened doors. Excuse the pun, but it kept their doors opened
in many cases. And our Net Promoter Scores reflect it. So they were very appreciative that we were able
to provide those products and services. If they need them again, we'll provide them. We just don't think
that they'll be at the levels that they were in the past.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then a quick follow-up. In the past, Mike, I think you've provided the breakdown of the rentals
business revenue in the fourth quarter by the various subsegments. I wonder if you'd be willing to do that
again this year.

Paul F. Adler
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Yes, Gary, it's Paul. And we do -- yes, Gary, we have that information for you. And I would preface it by
saying, first of all, what we provided typically is a Q4 sample, Q4 fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20. Obviously,
there's a lot of noise in these figures in that it's an unprecedented time. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter was the
onset of the pandemic. So a lot of job losses, a lot of pandemic-driven demand, as Todd just said, for
certain items of PPE. So I want to throw that out there first.

But last year's fourth quarter, so fiscal '20 Q4, uniform rental was 50% of the segment mix. Dust, which
is the walk-off mats, mops, that was 18% of the mix. Hygiene products, those are the soaps, the air
fresheners, sanitizing dispensers, et cetera, that's 14% last year. Shop towels were 4%. Linens, 10%. And
the catalog business, which is more like the direct -- small direct sales component of the rental business
products off of the route from the drivers, that was 4%.

So then this year's mix, uniform rental; 48%; dust, 17%; hygiene, 17%; shop towels, 4%; linens,
9%; and catalog, 5%. So again, obviously, COVID impacted results, not necessarily reflective of future
performance. But with this breakout, you can obviously see how strongly hygiene performed. Typically,
like in the Q4 of fiscal '20, that was mostly restroom-type items, so some air fresheners, the paper. But
in this Q4 '21, that hygiene percentage grew greater, driven by the sanitizer dispensers, the stands, the
sanitizing, sprays, et cetera. And then that catalog nudged up a little bit from 4% to 5%. And that's where

a lot of the PPE in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business that we've talked about is recorded.
The masks, gloves, those types of items.

Operator

And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.

Scott Andrew Schneeberger
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

For my first one, I just wanted to follow up on the M&A comments earlier. It sounded like you have a very
active pipeline that you're pursuing. I'm just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on what areas you
may be pursuing and size of targets and how ripe things are and then maybe what you're seeing with
regard to multiples, good or bad, in the environment.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Scott, I'll say each of our businesses were acquisitive. But tuck-ins, certainly, some geographic expansion
as well. So we're highly active. And there's folks that are at least answering phones and taking calls,
and we'll see where that goes. Certainly, you wonder about changes to tax -- potential changes to taxes.
Will that free things up? That will be interesting to see what happens with that. As far as the size and
multiples, those types of things, there's -- everything's come from the very small to medium-sized types. I
won't comment on else, but it's -- they're all active.

And part of it is because multiples, if you look at it historically in the marketplace, they're pretty high.
And -- but we're quite active in that area because we look at it from a very long-term approach. And we
know when we make those types of acquisitions that it positions us to grow those as well. Because of
our broad offering of products and services that we bring to the table that in many cases, the folks that
we're speaking to don't have that broadness, it allows for us to take a long-term approach and grow those
businesses, whether it's just in that area of the business or cross-selling it across each of our enterprise.

Scott Andrew Schneeberger
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Great. Appreciate that. And then my follow-up is a bit of a 2-parter, but it ties together pretty well.
In Todd's section in the press release, there was mention of investment in -- continued investment in
technology, a competitive advantage. Just hoping you could elaborate on that.

And then the back part of the question is CapEx was down a lot in the past fiscal year, almost half of what
it was in fiscal year '19 and down a good bit from fiscal '20. Just curious where that goes this year and
maybe tie it together with the tech question.

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

Great. I'll start with the tech question, and then Mike can handle the CapEx, if he prefers. The -- Scott,
we're investing heavily there because we see a need to -- from a -- whether it's productivity or from
a competitive advantage, all areas of our business, we talked about leveraging SAP, leveraging the
platforms that come along with that, they have customer benefits and operational benefits for us. And
then obviously, the data that goes along with that. But that being said, we see some opportunities in
automation that we've been investing in over the years. And we see opportunities to get efficiencies out of
our fleet that we're investing in that we think can pay big dividends in that area.

And so we're focused on doing such and making it easier to do business with Cintas. So -- and we think,
as you do that, that provides leverage for us. So leverage in the marketplace. So Michael, I'll let you
handle the CapEx question.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Sure. From a CapEx perspective, clearly, the amounts were down in this past year because capacity
needs just weren't the same as they had been in the previous years. We certainly kept up the CapEx for
maintenance activities. But as we -- there's a bit of a lag between when we need new capacity and when
this revenue starts to -- has started to come back. And we've seen some momentum, but there will be a
little bit of a lag in the CapEx.

Having said that, I expect we'll get back to historical levels by the end of the fiscal year. And that puts
us probably in the $200 million to $250 million range for fiscal '22. But certainly, when we invest, we will
certainly -- when we need to invest, whether it's capacity, technology or otherwise, we will certainly do
that.

Paul F. Adler
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Yes. The great news is, regarding our investment in the ERP system, SAP, that we've talked about a lot,
I mean, a lot of that investment spending in that -- some of the major expense is behind us. And it took
us a while to roll it out and get the entire network into SAP. We had the G&K acquisition that added more
locations and kind of slowed down the time to complete it. Then we had the pandemic. And so the exciting
thing is the additional investment will continue to be made throughout the business, of course, still in
technology. But a lot of it's already paid for. And now it's perfecting the system, taking the toy, so to
speak, out of the box and not just using it for the Xs and Os of running the business, but using it to meet
that competitive advantage to give us the data analytics and the other advantages that we haven't had
previously.

Operator

And our final question today comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.

Bryan Miles Wynn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

This is actually Bryan on for Kevin. Thanks for the commentary kind of around the color sort of on the
reopening and you don't expect -- not all customers are quite back yet. So just drilling in that a little bit.
How should we think about sort of what percentage of clients are still inactive versus maybe kind of how
that compares to out of businesses or attrition that we would see just to kind of frame that in. And any
sort of commentary around how that shakes out geographically -- either geographically or by vertical here
in the U.S.?

Todd M. Schneider
CEO, President & Director

So Bryan, I don't have a specific number for you, but just generally speaking, I'd say most businesses are
back to some degree, not certainly back to full bore. We mentioned Canada specifically as an outlier, which
we expect, let's just say, by August, September to be back much closer to normal.

But one of the big issues is there are 7 million people less working today than there were a year ago or so.
And of those 7 million people, I don't know what -- how many of them are Cintas wearers or will be, but
there's a percentage of. And we want those to -- certainly see those folks get back to work. And whether
they're wearing uniforms or utilizing our first aid products and services, all that impacts us. So the -- for
the most part, businesses are back. They're certainly not anywhere near where we think they will be over
time.

Bryan Miles Wynn
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. Okay. And then last one here for us. You guys talked about continuing to expand on ESG reporting.
And certainly, what we've noticed is the ESG scores tend to focus on the internal operations, but we'd be
curious if you could just touch on maybe how you guys help your customers achieve their ESG goals.

CINTAS CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

CEO, President & Director

Yes, Bryan, great question. Again, our heritage, what we do -- and frankly, as I'm speaking of the rental
business, what our industry does, the impact that it has on saving customers' water, energy, what we do
to treat water instead of it going down into the sewer, because those products, whether they're garments
or towels or what have you, all that, they're going to be either purchased and thrown in the garbage or
purchased and cleaned at home. And in both cases, we are helping substantially those folks helping the
environment and helping to save landfill space, helping to fill -- or excuse me, save water, energy and the
cleanliness of water as well.

And I don't think we've told the story well enough in the past. Because at our heritage, we are a wash
and reuse business. And again, without our industry, there would be millions of more gallons and units
of energy and et cetera that will be utilized because they're going to be either thrown to the landfill or
laundered somehow. And we know that we are infinitely more efficient at laundering those products than
they would be at home or in another type of setting.

J. Michael Hansen
CFO & Executive VP

I might add also that when you think about our first aid and safety and fire businesses, the purpose
of those businesses are to keep our customers' employees safe and healthy. And so it's a little bit of a
different ESG angle than what Todd was talking about. But from an employee perspective, our goals are
to help our customers really achieve the safety and the health of their employees. So we're looking out for
them from that S perspective of the ESG as well.
