Presentation

Andrey Galiuk
Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations

Hello. Good morning and welcome to Dover's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

Speaking today will be Richard Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer; and myself, Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development
and Investor Relations.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies
consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time.
This call will be available for playback through May 12, and the audio portion of this call will be archived on
our website for 3 months.

Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are
included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. We
want to remind everyone that our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are
subject to uncertainties and risks, including the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and on our
customer, suppliers, employees, operations, business, liquidity and cash flow. We caution everyone to
be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the first quarter
for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking
statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
except as required by law.

With that, I will turn this call over to Rich Tobin.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone.

We're going to take some sage advice and briskly go through what was a solid first quarter and get
straight to where we are from a market demand perspective and what actions we are taking with
our operations, cost structure and balance sheet to adapt ourselves to this extremely challenging
environment.

I'm not going to read the next slide, but we'll mention that the urgency and magnitude of the present
challenge is not lost on us, and we are working through these times with resolve and a sense of
responsibility to our employees, customers, partners, shareholders and local communities where we
operate. We understand our role as a supplier into many critical societal functions like food packaging
and retail, fueling, waste removal and many others. Moreover, our businesses supply directly into
projects aimed at fighting the outbreak, such as commercial cleaning, masks, hospital bed and ventilator
production as well as biopharmaceutical therapy development.

Let's go to Slide 4 of the quick summary of the first quarter results. We recognize that these results are
looking into the rearview mirror. Given the pace of change in the last few weeks, rest assured that despite
solid Q1 results, we have zero complacency given the progressively challenging outlook into Q2. To sum
up Q1, our ability to remain largely operational coupled with the work we did in our cost structure and
productivity initiatives more than offset the beginning headwinds of COVID-19, which largely impacted our
businesses in China and Italy in the quarter.

Let's go to Slide 5 and briefly look at segment performance. Engineered Products organic sales declined
2% as demand in auto-exposed businesses slowed down. The vehicle aftermarket business also
experienced operational interruptions in our China- and Europe-based facilities. Waste handling continue
to grow off of a strong backlog. Digital sales in the waste business were up nearly 2x on a year-over-year

basis. Pricing cost containment, in response to lower volumes as well as productivity actions, result in 100
basis points higher adjusted EBIT margins for the segment.

Moving on to Fueling Solutions saw a robust activity in North America driven by demand for EMV
compliant solutions, whereas Europe and Asia declined due to COVID-related production and supply chain
interruptions and project deferrals. Additionally, manufacture in our vehicle wash segment in the U.S. was
shut down in March due to local government mandates. The segment delivered 500 basis point margin
improvement as a result of favorable geographic and product mix, productivity actions and cost controls as
well as pricing.

Imaging and ID declined organically 4% in the quarter. Marking and coding was approximately flat on
strong demand for consumables due to surge in production volumes of consumer goods in March, which
offset the challenging conditions in Asia in Q1.

Our digital textile printing business had a difficult quarter as all of our operations are in the Lombardy
region of Italy, which bore the brunt of the COVID-19. This was further exacerbated by the sudden and
significant impact of the crisis on the global textile and apparel markets. Margin in the segment declined
only 80 basis points as our cost containment actions and favorable mix impact of consumables largely
offset the significant volume drop in our digital printing business.

Pumps & Process Solutions top line declined 1% organically. Strong performance in our hygienic and
biopharma pumps as well as in plastic and polymer systems and components largely offset slowing market
conditions in industrial pumps and downstream oil and gas complex. The segment delivered another
quarter of strong margin improvement driven by cost containment and restructuring actions as well as
pricing, more than offsetting negative impact of COVID inflation and FX translation.

And finally in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, organic sales declined 4% primarily driven by weaker
demand for heat exchangers and foodservice equipment, both as a result of governmental actions to
combat the COVID around the world. Core food retail business declined less than 1% as grocers began to
postpone remodel projects later in the quarter. Segment margin declined due to COVID-related production
curtailments in Asia and in Europe in SWEP as a volume -- and as volume reduction in food equipment.

From there, I'll pass it on to Brad.

Brad M. Cerepak
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Rich.

[Audio Gap]

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Try it now.

Brad M. Cerepak
Senior VP & CFO

Oh, you guys needed the whole thing. All right. Let me go to Slide 6. On top is the revenue bridge. As you
will know, FX was a meaningful headwind in Q1 reducing top line by 1% or $23 million driven primarily by
the dollar appreciating against the euro and also Brazilian, Swedish and Chinese currencies. Bookings were
up 1% organically and were similarly negatively impacted by FX and positively supported by acquisitions.

Performance by geography unfortunately reflects the quarter's coronavirus outbreak around the world.
All of Asia declined 19% organically while within Asia, China posted a 36% decline due to significant mid-
quarter disruption. Europe was down 7% principally driven by Fueling Solutions and Engineered Products.
U.S., our largest market, grew 4% organically with 4 out of 5 segments posting organic growth. We expect
Q2 to reflect a year-over-year drop in demand in the U.S. and Europe as COVID expanded into April. Also,

DOVER CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

we are watching cautiously for relative stabilization in China, although start-up has not -- although start-
up has been slow in some markets.

Let's go to the earning bridge on Slide 7. I'll refrain from going into detail on these bridges for the quarter
with 3 of 5 segments posting triple-digit-basis margin improvement further helped by reduced corporate
expenses. In addition to cost actions, margins were generally supported by mixed pricing and impacted
negatively by, first and foremost, lower volumes, inefficiencies associated with operational disruption, FX
and inflation. Outside of steel and fabrications, which started to trend positive, we have seen material cost
inflation in the quarter.

Now on Slide 8. Cash flow is top of mind as we move into Q2. We are pleased with the first quarter cash
generation with free cash flow for the quarter of $36 million, a $48 million improvement over last year.
Recall the first quarter is traditionally our lowest cash-generating quarter and typically shows negative
cash flow. Our teams have done a good job managing free cash flow more actively in this uncertain
environment, and we expect to continue to proactively manage working capital into the second quarter.
Capital expenditures were $40 million for the quarter, slightly increased versus comparable period as we
continue to execute our in-flight growth and productivity capital projects started in 2019. Most of these
projects are slated for completion in the second quarter.

Lastly, let me update you on our financial position on Slide 9. We believe Dover's financial standing is
strong and positions us well to navigate the unfolding period of uncertainty. First, we have been targeting
a prudent capital structure and our leverage at 2.2x EBITDA places us comfortably in the investment-
grade rating with a margin of safety. Second, we don't have long-term debt maturities until 2025, thanks
to the refinancing effort we undertook in Q4 last year, which shifted out the maturities and reduced our
interest expense. Lastly, we are operating with approximately $1 billion of current liquidity, which consists
of about $500 million of cash and another $500 million of unused revolver capacity. We drew $500
million of our revolver in the first quarter out of abundance of caution when commercial paper markets
experienced volatility in late March. Proceeds were used to principally pay off maturing commercial paper.
We are back in the commercial paper market in April, and we'll use cash on the program to potentially pay
the revolver if conditions remain stable.

So in summary, at this time, we expect free cash flow to remain strong for the company as we move into
the second quarter.

With that, I'm going to pass it back to Rich.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Let's try not to put each other on mute. Sorry about that, Brad.

Let's go on to Slide 10. Since we suspended full year guidance, we'll dive deeper into current trading
conditions and our actions over the next few slides. Slide 10, we will cover the current demand outlook as
of mid-April and projected status of our operating footprint for the quarter.

First, Engineered Products. As previewed in our Q1 results, industrial automation and vehicle aftermarket
as well as industrial winch markets have slowed and continued trending weak with material deceleration in
March after positive January and February. We are taking capacity management actions in Q2 across these
businesses to rightsize our cost and working capital.

Waste handling continues to be constructive as our waste municipal fleet customers operate as essential
businesses and are seeing large increases in residential volumes, which are more truck intensive.

Fueling Solutions is a bit of a bright spot. Order trends have been robust on U.S. EMV, and the business
saw good trends in March with some sequential slowing in April. Customer base is operational as retail
fueling is generally considered essential business worldwide and record-high fuel margins on low oil price
helped operators offset the reduction in volume and traffic. On the downside, transportation and vehicle
wash markets are likely to see delays in capital outlays during this near-term uncertainty. We are largely

DOVER CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

up and running in the segment, except 1 vehicle wash facility in Michigan and a few smaller dispenser
sites in Brazil, Italy and India.

In imaging and ID, digital textile printing will be challenged in 2020 as fashion and apparel markets deal
with an unprecedented shutdown of apparel retail globally. Marking and coding has held up in Q1 with
strong orders in February and March, and we expect it to be relatively resilient as 40% of sales are driven
by consumables tied directly to current production volumes in fast-moving consumer goods, which surged
in Q1 and should sustain as consumers shift to home-based consumption of packaged goods. Parts of this
business are not immune, notably industrial end markets and printer and service sales as our customers
delay planned maintenance due to peak utilization or visitation and/or travel restrictions. We expect to
recover such delayed sales at a later time. We are progressing with the integration of Systech, which is
responsible for the majority of the backlog increase you can see in the segment.

In Pumps & Process Solutions, while we are seeing sequential slowdown in the oil and gas markets served
primarily by our Precision Components business, trends appear constructive in military, chemicals, food
and beverage, power generation and some industrial verticals while biopharma and hygiene are areas
of strong growth. Maag plastics and polymer equipment has not seen material project cancellation and
continues operating with a solid backlog that equates to nearly half of their annual revenue base. We have
a substantial spare parts business in this segment, and large share revenues is derived from consumables
or installed base replacement versus first-fit capital construction. These should be supportive factors.

And in Retail and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, this segment is facing the largest near-term demand
headwind in our portfolio, and it's spread across several businesses within the segment. In the core food
retail business, orders trended positive in February and March. But starting in March, many retailers were
forced to postpone remodeling and construction projects due to peak traffic volumes, local restrictions and
inability of contractors and technicians to gain site access. The backlog in this business is solid, but the
shipment timing remains uncertain. We expect that increased wear and tear of store equipment will result
in a surge of volume of frozen and refrigerated products being sold will create substantial pent-up demand
and we will be well positioned to capture the rebound when it comes. Overall, we expect several quarters
of mix to potentially variable performance in this business.

Our heat exchanger business has faced both operational disruptions in Asia and demand reduction
in HVAC industry globally with material sequential slowing in March. Backlog has improved in the
quarter, but we do see uncertainty here as we must wait for our customers to come back online. Our
commercial foodservice business is facing significant demand challenges in the restaurant segment,
only partially offset by opportunities in the institutional market. There's no hiding here. March has seen
unprecedented decline in order trends. We will manage capacity aggressively through the year with
significant curtailments already begun in Q2.

Let's go to the next slide. We have taken a proactive cost containment stance early in Q1. As you can
see, our SG&A cost has declined in absolute terms in Q1 mainly driven by travel curtailment and lower
incentive compensation costs. The quantum of these actions accelerates in Q2, which I'll cover on the next
slide.

We are progressing on our $50 million center-led cost-out program as planned with $13 million achieved
in Q1 primarily from IT and a variety of other cost items. For clarity's sake, the charts are not fully
additive as both include SG&A, as you can see from the footnote. On the cash flow side, we are cutting
CapEx in light of demand environment. Our -- we view $100 million as committed and nondiscretionary
spend, which shows you we have additional flex we have should the downturn be deeper and longer than
expected. We carry over $1 billion of working capital in the business, which we scaled down with revenue
were better primarily driven by inventory management.

After all that, let's get on to the most important slide in the deck, let's not sugarcoat this. QP -- Q2 is
going to be tough. Despite a healthy backlog, we will be curtailing or adjusting capacity down across
a large proportion of our portfolio companies driven by the following. In some locations, government
mandates prevent us from operating. You can see in the business that this impacts the most. In several
end markets that I touched on earlier, weak demand warrants curtailed capacity. In food retail, we expect
a significant portion of our backlog to shift to H2 as retailers continue facing operational challenges in

DOVER CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

executing their projects as a result of heavy traffic and inability of contractor access. And Category 4 is
driven by proactive working capital management and hedged against weaker demand environment than
forecast. We have capacity to catch up that deferred production in the second half.

In addition to the lost margin on lower revenue, these capacity reductions and curtailments will cause
year-over-year comparative material fixed cost under absorption of approximately $35 million to $40
million in the quarter. We estimate that our variable cost reduction levers and flow-through on in-flight
programs will positively contribute to approximately $65 million in the quarter, which will take you back to
the previous slide of the offsets that we had in Q1.

On the cash flow side, we expect inventory management to contribute positively in the quarter. We do
intend to pay the dividend as scheduled in June and we'll fund the bolt-on acquisition of Em-Tech in Q2.

So to wrap up, let's put some directional guideposts out there for the year in the absence of formal
guidance. The year can unfold in -- with a variety of different scenarios, but it will almost certainly be
negative revenue change of yet unknown magnitude. We will focus on what we can control best, our costs.
We target full year decremental margin of 25% to 30%, of which we have a variety of actions to offset
volume under absorption.

You saw a glimpse of the levers in the prior 2 slides, and we prepared a full arsenal of actions for the
remainder of the year. On the cash flow side, we will reduce our capital spend with flexibility to defer
more. We are targeting cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of adjusted earnings for the year. We have
suspended our share repurchases but intend to continue paying a dividend. And lastly, our M&A posture
remains opportunistic. We will continue pursuing logical bolt-on acquisitions at rational valuations.
In summation, I want to thank everyone at Dover for their perseverance in these difficult times, and let's
open it up to Q&A.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Rich, I missed the first 15 minutes or so of the call. But I'm just wondering a couple of things, your
comments on refrigeration and the difficulty getting jobs done. Are you seeing any other situations where
it's the opposite? I mean fueling comes to mind where there's less traffic at the gas station, perhaps
it makes sense to actually accelerate and get some of this work done if the capital has already been
budgeted. That's the first question. I just have a follow-up.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Well, on the first question, you -- I can't answer it any better than the way you stated it. I mean the
fact of the matter is that on the retail fueling side, that's outdoor work so there's more flexibility. And it is
an industry that is -- I forget what they describe them as is important I guess or essential. So we've seen
obviously no slowdown or any real material issues in terms on the retail fueling side.

On the refrigeration side, it's more indoor work. And because of traffic restrictions and everything you see
in the supermarkets going on, I think it's understandable what's happening there.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And then just to be clear on what you're saying on restructuring. So you're not increasing kind of the $50
million bucket, so to speak, but you're doing these other actions on variable costs, G&A and the like. Is
that correct? Or are you actually stepping up restructuring? And what's your scope to pull forward actions
you may have had on the table for '21 and beyond?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Okay. Well, the $50 million is solid. So you saw the benefit. I think it was $13 million in Q1. We expect
that to be relatively even through the 4 quarters of the year, if you want to do the mathematics behind.
The balance of it is not restructuring, it's cost containment actions of variable costs and unfortunately, the
direct labor costs of when we're furloughing and then curtailing our operations. So I wouldn't put in the
restructuring bucket because it's more volume-related as opposed to permanent cost takeout.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And then maybe along those lines, are there things that are not going to come back with volume recovery,
there's other things you're doing in corporate or your view on travel in the future, those sorts of things? Or
should we expect all those kind of volume-related savings to also swing the other way when we do get on
the good side of this thing?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Hard to say I think what happens with travel going forward from here, but I would expect that '21 will
probably be lower than '19. If we give -- if you want an opinion on it. We are, as we mentioned, that we --
when we established the $50 million for this year, that we're building up plans for another $50 million for
next year. We'll see how we progress on that because the fact of the matter is with everybody at home,
working on some of our productivity plans has become a little bit difficult, and we've really had to turn

the tarp here to deal with immediate cost actions as opposed to longer-term ones. So I understand your
question. I think let's get further into the year, and I think that we can probably put some brackets around
that.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett.

Ivana Delevska
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

This is Ivana on for John. So I just wanted to clarify. So the 6% SG&A cut, that would be incremental to
the $50 million of cost cut. And could you give us a sense of how much would that be in Q2 and Q3? And
how are you thinking about it versus the volume decline?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

I would turn your attention to Slide 12 in the bottom left-hand corner of the presentation that we posted
where it gives you our cost actions for Q2. We're not going to comment on Q3 yet. Let's see how Q2
progresses. Other than the fact that the $50 million of structural cost takeout, you can divide by 4, if you
want to model it into quarters.

Brad M. Cerepak
Senior VP & CFO

And just for clarity, as we said on the chart, the $50 million is inclusive in the 6% down.

Ivana Delevska
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

The $50 million -- okay. I get it. Okay. And then one follow-up. Could you give us a breakdown of your
fixed versus variable cost structure ideally for both [indiscernible] and SG&A?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

It's not a meaningful metric in consolidation. If there's follow-up -- because the operating companies
are so different in their profile, I think I'd recommend that you get back with Andrey for some follow-up
questions there.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

I know it's early, but is it impossible to think about -- start thinking about M&A here and particularly
perhaps if there's the stressed assets like food equipment, stuff like that?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

It's not impossible to think about it. Distressed assets is really -- I don't know if that's our bailiwick.
I'm not taking it off the table, but if we were to go kind of what the time line is in situations like these,
the first things that come available are distressed assets. Everybody is going to hold on for a V-shaped
recovery to see if what happens to asset values of some of the things that we were looking at last year.
So our expectation is what we will see early on are going to be distressed. It's going to have to be really
attractive for us to pursue something like that, Scott.

DOVER CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

Melius Research LLC

Yes. And just -- and if you said it, I apologize, I didn't hear it, but how much down are the food equipment
business orders? Is it magnitude like 90% or some...

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

We didn't size...

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

Extraordinarily high number like that or...

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We didn't size it during the comments, but it's very material.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.

Ronny Paul Scardino
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

This is Ronny Scardino on for Joe Ritchie. So just first on restructuring, we're curious, does the backdrop
we're in make it easier for you to execute on rolling out Dover business services faster to your operating
companies? And just one follow-up.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think that anytime that you go into a situation like this that it heightens everybody's focus on cost
structure, for sure. But having said that, implementation becomes more difficult with this stay at home.
So it's a little bit more difficult, as I mentioned in my comments, about deploying some of the people
around to our businesses to start working on that. But having said that, in part of our year-over-year
cost savings, DBS is a foundational pillar. So we don't expect it to slow down at all going into the -- going
through this year. What's your next question?

Ronny Paul Scardino
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's fair. And then where across your portfolio do you think there could be more resilience in this
downturn?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think if you go back and you look at the slide that we prepared on Slide 10, it gives you the best
window of how the business is performing both from a demand point of view and what our operational
stance is. I think that should answer your question. That's more granular than, generally speaking, we
give in inter-year comments.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

DOVER CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

Maybe just help us understand what's happening in Fueling Solutions, the extent to which that Q1
bookings number, the strength was maybe something of a blip. Have you seen much in the way of
pushouts or cancellations around U.S. EMV investments? Or are you expecting those to occur?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

We have not. And right now, we don't expect -- we expect some slowing in Q2 because we had to curtail
our U.S. operations at the beginning of April mostly due to a COVID issue where we had to shut the plant
down. Otherwise, we would be up and running on the above ground side based on the backlog that you
can see.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I see. So on the demand front, you haven't seen too much disruption in the U.S. even with miles driven
collapsing and so forth.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

No. I mean, I think that again, as we mentioned at the close of last year, we said that there was 1 area
with potential upside. It would be that EMV adoption has actually been accelerating into Q4 and that
it continued into Q1. Unless that stance changes, we don't have any reason to believe for a material
slowdown. Now it's not going to be absolutely the same quarter-by-quarter. It's going to move based on
orders -- order intake and everything else. But right now, we go into the quarter with a robust backlog. I
think that we'll have less production performance in Q2, but that's on us only because we've had to take
the sites down, as I mentioned.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then my second topic would be around the DII segment. There is a very large amount of European
demand exposure in that business. Maybe just help us understand how the short-cycle trends in European
DII or that segment globally. How have those been trending in the very recent past?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think that we need to split that business between the printing and ID and then the textile side.
The textile side is under enormous pressure so much so that I would expect that, that is going to have
a difficult full year, just what's going on in retail operations on textile demand. On the printing and ID
side, it had a good quarter, including Europe. Because of fast-moving consumer goods production and the
amount of consumables that we are shipping, it's difficult in terms of the actual printers themselves and
on the maintenance side. But as you recall -- you may recall, that was a businesses -- a business that we
expected to have a significant improvement in year-over-year productivity because of management cost
actions taken in Q4.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

DOVER CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

We have, I would say, not material issues in our own supply chain side. I think that, that had manifested
itself earlier in Q1 when China was down. It took a little bit for the freight side of it to unlock. We have
some challenges, but they're not insurmountable in our comment. And China is recovering, but it's a slow
recovery in terms of the demand function.

David Emerson Ridley-Lane
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And then on the potential for other curtailments during this quarter, just sort of trying to understand how
large or meaningful that could be in terms of the margin impact as you think about it.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Well, I can't give you more information than we gave on Slide 12, right? The curtailments are going to
cost us between $35 million and -- estimated between $35 million and $40 million of fixed cost absorption
alone. So that should give you an idea of the significance of the capacity curtailments we're going to take
out in Q2. So I'm not going to size it more than that, but we are going to manage this business not hoping
for -- we're not burning down relative strength in backlog in Q2. We're going to make some bets on the
linearity of the demand and in certain cases, actually proactively cut production to manage the working
capital impact.

Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

We can.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Look, I apologize if some of these questions have been asked before, trying to manage 2 calls here.
What's -- have you addressed free cash flow, Rich, in terms of expectations for the full year and sources
of cash from working capital and how that plays out through the year? Just wondering, obviously, no
earnings going right now, but how do you expect cash to perform versus earnings?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

If you go and take a look at the deck that we posted on 13, we expect free cash conversion to be 100% of
adjusted net earnings for the full year of 2020, and that is going to be influenced by, depending on market
conditions, a liquidation of the balance sheet.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And would you expect that to be a bit more back-end loaded to liquidate that balance sheet? Or do
you think that can be a bit more in 2Q onwards?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Not as -- well, you know what, let's think positive for a moment. Not as back-end loaded as in previous
years because, hopefully, we're beginning to ramp up production in the second half of the year. So it

may be a little bit more inverted because we're cutting production midyear, which we generally are not,
that's usually what our highest capacity utilization is. So we expect it to be more cash-generative from
a working capital point of view in the middle 2 quarters. And let's think positive about Q4 and hopefully,
we're ramping up production in Q4.

Brad M. Cerepak
Senior VP & CFO

And if you missed it earlier, we did take down our CapEx spending expectation for this year. And as it says
here on Page 13, there's further flex there as well. So in our prepared comments, we talked about our
ability to continue to manage our free cash flow through this year with an expectation that we're going to
deliver 100% against adjusted earnings. So how that falls out will depend on how fast we liquidate across
the balance sheet.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Right. I did see the CapEx, so I'm not completely blind. But the -- in terms of pricing, you did 0.7% pricing
this quarter. Just wondering if you could maybe just give a little bit color in terms of what you've seen
across the portfolio on pricing. And if you have any concerns on maybe pricing can shift deflationary
towards the back half of the year.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

I think that we are concerned about it, but we haven't seen any kind of crazy pricing in the marketplace as
a general comment.

Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Rich, just like following up on RF&E and just sort of the progress you've made there with the automation
project and talking about the second half of the year and what to expect. I think sort of talking about the
comment you made, you expect some mix results in the business but obviously, stronger demand. So how
does that over time? You've got a good backlog, how does it all sort of go together here as you go into
the second half of the year? I think you saw a strong Belvac, which is good margin. So I guess instead of
continuing to ramble, can you still do that mid-teens margin in this business? Or is it just tougher because
of the mix and demand environment?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

The answer is, Andy, I don't know yet, right? At the end of the day, we've got a backlog in the
refrigeration business that we could run out in Q2 and get all the production performance and do decently
on margins in advance of the automation benefit, which is in the second half of the year. But based on the
signals that we're getting from the marketplace and the inability for our customers to actually do these
projects, we are proactively taking down production. It's down now, as a matter of fact, in our principal
sites because it just doesn't make sense to get the production performance and build all the inventory,
right? So we'll see in the back half of the year. We believe that there's pent-up demand in this business.
It's unfortunate because this was the year where we were hoping to kind of turn the corner, and this
COVID-ness has really put a nail through it.

So over the longer term, we're going to continue to work on the automation. So that doesn't stop. It's
very difficult for me to say, we're sitting here today, what happens with the demand function. Meaning, did
we just lose a quarter here and that volume is going to bleed over into '21? It's hard to say at this point.
But I think it's better than even bet. On the balance of the portfolio, sure, Belvac was we said was going to

be second half loaded, and we believe that to be the case. The ones that are more difficult to predict right
now is SWEP, which is -- there's been some earnings releases out of HVAC already, so you know what's
going on there. The industrial footprint of HVAC in Europe has been largely down during the months of
March and into April. So we need that to come back so we can resume deliveries. And in food equipment,
I think that we are just going to have to retrench for a period of time until all of this lockdown goes away
because of the detrimental impact on the restaurant business.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Rich, that's helpful. And then I didn't hear your comments on Engineered Products, but maybe you can
sort of talk about, obviously, a lot of businesses in there. So how is the, for instance, VSG doing in the
sense that it seems like a more difficult business in this kind of environment, COVID impacted. So you've
got about half of that business that's auto focused in some way. So maybe talk about the difference
between that business versus waste handling and how the overall do you see that business is doing?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Look, VSG, being objective, had a significant portion of the production shut in Q1 in Italy. So the
performance in Q1, from a margin point of view, was excellent. But having said that, it is not -- those
repair shops and everything else are not critical industries for the most part and are dealing with this
whole stay-at-home phenomenon. So I think the management is proactively taking down production in
VSG in Q2 to manage its working capital itself.

But having said that, that's aftermarket business. It's basically miles driven and everything else so we
would expect that to not be bad in the second half. That's our expectations right now. Some of the smaller
businesses like winches, as far as winches and things like that, that's going to -- that's more tied to capital
goods and that's going to go through a tough year.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Got it. And on the waste handling side, relatively -- I mean you still have good backlog there.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Backlog's good. I think that we're going to manage our capacity down in Q2. As I mentioned about
burning down backlog until you get a line of sight, I expect that business to perform well this year, but I
think we're going to take production performance down comparatively a little bit in Q2.

DOVER CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2020

Real quickly on the curtailments for the second quarter, the 10-Q mentions that 7% of your major global
facilities are shut completely as of April 17 and 11% are partially closed or at lower capacity. And I know
it's tough, but is that a reasonable way to think about second quarter organic sales down maybe low
double digit? Or could it be much worse than that for any reason? Like is there a big destock in the
channel that would impact you kind of more than what we're seeing in industrial production? Like -- just
curious, any color you could provide on that.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. That's a good call to try to get Q2 revenue. Look, clearly, the deteriorating conditions at the end of Q1
would say that the -- and the fact that we came out and said I think on one of the first bullet points that
we expect Q2 to be the most difficult quarter of the year would imply that revenue is going to be down,
exacerbated by the fact that we're going to cut production so significantly. But I'm not going to size it for
you.

Patrick Michael Baumann
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And on the free cash flow maybe. Could you mention -- I mean we talked about CapEx coming down
and you're managing working capital in a few different areas. And then the filings also indicate something
about tax payments being pushed out. Maybe if you could address sustainability of the actions you're
taking and how we should expect some of this to revert on the other side when things get better. Like is
the CapEx cut just a deferral of certain things that ultimately come back?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

I think that the demand environment would have to change in excess of our forecast for the second half
of the year for the CapEx to come back. So in a certain way, I hope that we have to reforecast CapEx back
up at some point during the year. But unless the demand environment changes more than our forecast on
a positive, I would expect it not to come up.

Brad M. Cerepak
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And the cash flow on the deferrals, I mean I think every company is going to see that type of activity
related around the act. So it's not a major number. It's not a big number, but it is something we take
advantage of, so to speak. There's also -- even on your personal taxes, there's deferral of timing, but it's
still within the year. So there's going to be some aberration on that, but nothing that changes our view on
free cash flow for the year.

Patrick Michael Baumann
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then just -- sorry to follow up that first question since I didn't really get an answer. The
scheduled curtailments, you said $35 million to $40 million of reduction in fixed cost absorption. And
then underneath that, on Slide 12, it says $50 million of offset actions on controllable costs. So is the net
number then a $15 million -- am I taking the $50 million minus that $35 million to $40 million to think
about the year-over-year impact? Like so you're fully offsetting those curtailment hits...

Brad M. Cerepak
Senior VP & CFO

At the end of the day, what's the revs down? You still got to come up with -- that's the number you're
missing there.

Patrick Michael Baumann
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So the fixed cost absorption below that.

Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Rich, I know it's still early, but I was hoping you could look ahead and talk about what you think might be
some of the secular changes from the pandemic on how it would impact Dover's businesses. Any specifics
come to mind? We've heard some general commentary about more reshoring. I'm not sure that makes
sense, maybe carrying more buffer inventory. But how do you think this changes the structure of the
organization and some of the emphasis on working capital and so forth?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think, Deane, that Dover is made up by a collection of medium-sized companies that don't really
have the longest supply chains. So I think that some of the anecdotal comments about what's going
to happen from bigger vertical industrials really don't apply to us. To the extent that there is reshoring
in a certain way, I hope so because that's to our benefit in a lot of cases for some of our components
businesses.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

But then on Dover specifics, do you see any longer-term changes in retail fueling on like commuter
behavior as well as the supermarkets maybe shifting to more warehouse-type operations for food delivery,
anything along those lines?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Not anything different than we would have thought going into this crisis, no. I think that -- I don't think
there's anything secular other than what we've been always watching at the end of the day. And I would
argue that on the -- at least on the food retail, we would think that we're turning the corner that it's more
in our favor going into the future, but we'll see.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And just last one from me. No surprise that you're maintaining the dividend. And maybe if you
could just expand on the buyback decision on -- stopping for now. How much of that is in consideration of

The last question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird.

Mircea Dobre
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Rich, I want to go back to the disclosure you provided on Slide 6 where you talked about the geographic
detail. And just sort of big picture wondering here, I mean this whole COVID issue started in Asia, started
moving westward from there hitting Europe, impacting the U.S. now. When you sort of look at your
business, is it fair to expect that the U.S. could be following a pattern similar to Europe or maybe even
down the line, your Asia business in terms of growth? Or do you think that there is some particular offsets
in your business mix or operations that would make U.S. look different than the other geographies?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

I would think that it will follow the same pattern, but I'd be careful about using the quantum of the
percents only because of our participation in different regions, like the law of small numbers, but without
question. We were talking about when we put the slide together, it's like you can almost watch this
COVID-19 travel the world, and we would expect that with the lockdowns that we had late in Q1 that are
in exist today that, that same pattern would come to the U.S. or North America.

Mircea Dobre
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So sorry to press you on this, but I'm trying to understand if Europe right now is a better benchmark,
[ affected ] by the U.S. business, maybe Asia not.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

You can't only because the numerator and the denominators are all different. So you have to be careful
about just using the percentages and saying, well, which one should I pick, the 19% or the 7%.

Brad M. Cerepak
Senior VP & CFO

It's -- as we talked about, even the fueling business in the U.S. has shown strength and continues to show
strength. So it's not the same in every geo in terms of stats.

Brad M. Cerepak
Senior VP & CFO

Right.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

Right? And that's why we are intervening on the production base. So whatever number you want to put on
it, you could put on it, but it's going to be a different number.

Mircea Dobre
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

We all understand that. We're just trying to do our best from the outside to try to get the numbers as
close as we can. And sticking with fueling here, your orders were up nicely, your backlog is up nicely. As
you sort of think about your business versus the initial expectations that you set up for the year of being
up 0% to 2%, I'm just sort of wondering what has worked out different than your expectations. And where
do you think we are right now in terms of the EMV upgrade cycle in terms of penetration?

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

You know what, we haven't had the time to run those penetration numbers. I think when we put the
forecast together for '20, we said if there was 1 segment that we thought had some upside, it was going
to be Fueling Solutions because of the order trends that we saw in Q4 about EMV adoption. Clearly, that
has held in Q1. So it's better than we would expected, but it was within the window of our forecast. But as
you know, we've always been -- we spent a year trying to push this adoption rate out. And now it seems
to be accelerating. Whether that holds through the year, I hope so, but we'll see. But that's what's driving
the backlog.

Mircea Dobre
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

No. I understand that part. I'm just wondering if we're in the third, the fifth or the seventh inning of this
adoption cycle.

Richard Joseph Tobin
President, CEO & Director

I don't know. I don't know. Like I said, we haven't had time to -- with everything that's going on, we
haven't had time to size it from a total market. And as we've said numerous times, from a revenue point
of view, it's all over the map, depending on whether you're doing full dispenser units or just kits.
