MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, January 30, 2020.

I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead.

Tim Argo
Senior VP & Director of Finance

Thank you, Priscilla. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me
are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our
COO; and Brad Hill, Executive Vice President and Head of Transactions.

Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I would like to point out that as part of the
discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ
materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in
yesterday's earnings release and our '34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may
impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy
of this morning's call, will be available on our website.

During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-
GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial
data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.

I'll now turn the call over to Eric.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Tim, and good morning. Our fourth quarter results were better than expected as improved rent
growth and record low resident turnover continued to drive positive trends in overall revenue performance.
Over the course of last year, we focused on an opportunity to prioritize rent growth and push that agenda
throughout the year. As a result, we carry good pricing momentum into the new year. Based on our
updated analysis, we do now expect that the overall level of new supply deliveries in 2020 will run higher
than in 2019. This will, of course, vary by market.

As has been routinely commented on, the majority of the new supply continues to be higher end product
at a high price point. Based on our detailed submarket analysis, it's important to note that the new supply
forecasted to deliver in our markets in 2020 will be at rents that, on average, will be 25% higher than the
rent across our properties in the same submarkets.

While we are certainly not immune to the impact of new supply, we see this pricing gap is generating good
long-term opportunity. The price point of our portfolio, the quality of our locations, the diversified nature
of our submarkets, the strength of our operating platform and a number of new initiatives that we are
rolling out in 2020, along with the pricing momentum that was built in calendar year 2019, will continue to
support steady growth in NOI over the coming year.

One of the benefits surrounding the new and higher-priced product delivering into the market is the
expanding redevelopment opportunity created in a number of our properties. The price spread between
the new supply and the existing rents at our properties creates opportunity to upgrade and still offer
attractive value to our leasing prospects while also generating a very accretive use of shareholder capital.
Our property upgrade and repositioning pipeline will expand in 2020, supporting above-market rent
growth in a number of locations over the next couple of years.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

We continue to find select opportunities to capture disciplined new external growth. We began the year
with our new development pipeline at 2,100 units, representing $490 million in new investment. In
addition, we have 640 new units undergoing initial lease-up, representing $146 million in additional new
investment. We did close on one new acquisition in Q4. Consistent with the transactions we executed on
over the past few years, this was a newly built property undergoing initial lease-up. We partially match
funded the acquisition with new equity issued through our ATM program, thereby retaining plenty of
growth capacity and protection for the balance sheet.

So in summary, our Sunbelt markets continue to capture great demand. MAA's portfolio is uniquely
balanced and well positioned across the region to capture this demand. Our redevelopment and new
development pipelines are growing. Emerging new technologies and products will also support further
NOI growth, and the balance sheet is in a great position with ample capacity to jump on compelling
opportunities. I want to thank our team of associates here at MAA for a great year of performance in
2019, and we look forward to another year of progress in 2020.

I'll turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance for the fourth quarter exceeded
our expectations with the steady demand for apartments and our enhanced platform with continued
momentum in rent growth and strong average daily occupancy.

Same-store effective rent growth per unit increased 4.3% for the quarter. This is the seventh straight
quarter of year-over-year improving ERU growth. As a result, our year-over-year same-store revenue
growth was 4.1%, the highest it's been since 2016. Effective rent per unit increased 60 basis points
sequentially. Revenue performance was led by steady momentum and blended new and renewal lease-
over-lease pricing, up 2.6% for the quarter, which is 100 basis points better than this time last year.

In addition, average daily occupancy during the quarter remained strong at 95.7%. As we wrap up
January, average daily occupancy is still strong at 95.5% and compares to 96% in January of last year.
Our 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units and notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.2%, 10 basis
points better than this time last year.

Looking forward, as Eric mentioned, our overall supply in our markets is expected to increase in 2020.
The Dallas, Houston and Savannah markets are expected to be the most challenging. Based on our pricing
progress last year, along with current rent and exposure trends, we expect our leading revenue markets to
be Phoenix, Raleigh, Austin and Nashville.

Of course, the new supply creates an opportunity for our redevelopment platform. In addition to our
kitchen and bath program, we are underway with an amenity upgrade program at 10 communities.
This $20 million to $25 million investment in 2020 is primarily focused on legacy Post assets, where the
product was built in excellent locations, and new supply continues to push the rent of the submarket up.
In these cases, we can update leasing centers, hallways and common areas, create shared workspaces,
outdoor gathering areas and rooftop decks to allow us to increase rent while still offering compelling value
in these submarkets.

Our technology platform also continues to expand. Our overhauled operating system and new website has
contributed to our ability to attract, engage and create value for our residents. Our tests on smart homes
have gone well. The technology was installed in 15 communities with minimal disruption and has been well
received by our residents. We expect to install 24,000 smart home units in 2020. Our high-speed Internet
access initiative is deploying and will be a contributor to 2020 NOI growth. We are also exploring a range
of AI chat, customer resource management and prospect engagement tools.

We're pleased with the progress our teams made in 2019 and greatly appreciate their efforts. We have a
solid base of earned-in rent growth as we head into 2020 and are excited about the opportunities ahead.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide brief comments on what we are seeing in
the transaction market as well as on our transaction activity in Q4. As you're all aware, the transaction
market continues to be extremely competitive with record levels of liquidity and demand for multifamily
properties. Given the favorable migration and job growth trends that exist in our region of the country,
investor demand for multifamily properties within our footprint continues to be robust, leading to deep
bidder pools, aggressive pricing and compressed cap rates.

Reflecting the positive job growth and strong demand, we expect supply to increase in 2020. This
increased level of supply should continue to support a historically high level of acquisition and prepurchase
deal flow. We remained disciplined in our capital deployment decisions. And Al and his team have our
balance sheet in great shape, allowing us to respond to compelling investment opportunities as they
materialize.

As we've done in the past, we'll continue to focus our acquisition efforts on new lease-ups. In Q4, we
closed on the acquisition of The Greene in downtown Greenville, South Carolina. This was a recently
completed asset involving a developer and equity provider we've worked with in the past. The asset was
still in its initial lease-up with the equity requiring a certain and quick close by year-end. We were able to
execute on the acquisition at a stabilized market cap rate of 5.1%.

In 2020, we'll also continue to pursue prepurchase opportunities. As a reminder, this is a program where
we partner with good developers that have access to great real estate. We bring the capital to the venture
and return -- and in return, we get access to an asset at a reduced basis with a clear path to 100%
ownership at stabilization. This program allows us to selectively pick well-located, to-be-built assets
while minimizing our overall development risk. In Q4, we closed and started construction on a 264-unit
prepurchase, located 9 miles southwest of downtown Orlando in the very desirable high income Dr. Phillips
area.

And finally, in Q4, we took advantage of strong investor demand and pricing and sold all 5 of our assets
and exited the Little Rock, Arkansas market. We had over 25 qualified bidders offer on these properties.
We achieved good pricing for this noncore market with 24-year-old properties, equating to a 5.4% market
cap rate. We will continue to selectively prune our portfolio on an ongoing basis, and we'll have more to
say about our specific 2020 disposition plans in coming quarters.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Al.

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some brief commentary on the company's
fourth quarter earnings performance, major financing activity, and then finally, on our initial guidance for
2020. Reported FFO per share of $1.68 for the fourth quarter was $0.05 per share above the midpoint
of our guidance with the majority of this outperformance produced by property NOI as both operating
revenues and expenses were favorable to expectations for the quarter. FFO per share was $6.55 for the
full year, which included several items considered unusual or not core to our business, such as the market-
to-market valuation of our preferred shares and gains on sales of land parcels. Excluding these noncore
items, FFO for the full year would have been $6.26 per share. As discussed more in a moment, we are
providing earnings guidance for 2020 on a core FFO basis, which we believe will help provide a clear
picture of performance.

We were active on the financing front during the fourth quarter as we issued $300 million in new public
bonds. We also retired $170 million of unsecured loans and $17 million of additional secured debt. The
effective interest rate of the new bonds will be 3.1% over 10 years after considering the interest rate
hedges related to the financings. We ended the year with 98.4% of our debt fixed with an average
duration of almost 8 years, which is a record for the company. During the fourth quarter, we also issued

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

$20 million in new equity through our ATM program, essentially match funding a portion of the Greenville
property acquisition mentioned by Brad.

Finally, we are providing initial earnings guidance for 2020 with the release, which is detailed in our
supplemental information package, providing guidance for net income per diluted common share, which is
reconciled to FFO, core FFO and core AFFO in the supplement. Core FFO for the full year 2020 is projected
to be $6.38 to $6.62 per share or $6.50 per share at the midpoint. The definition of core FFO, including
a description of the items considered noncore, can be found in our supplemental package. The primary
driver of 2020 earnings performance is same-store NOI growth, which is projected to be 3.5% at the
midpoint.

Effective rent growth for the year is expected to be around 3.7%, produced by 2020 lease-over-lease
blended rental pricing growth of 3.4% at the midpoint, combined with the 2019 blended rental pricing of
4.4% achieved. This pricing, combined with a slight decrease in average occupancy to 95.8% average for
the year, brings projected total rental revenue to the 3.5% range. Fees and other income items combined
are projected to add an additional 20 to 25 basis points to revenue growth for the year with the primary
driver being a 55 basis points contribution from the Double Play bulk internet program, which is partially
offset by other fees and reimbursement items which are projected to remain essentially flat for 2020
primarily due to slightly lower occupancy.

These items combine to produce our total same-store revenue growth expectation of 3.75% for 2020 at
the midpoint. Same-store operating expenses will continue to have some pressure from real estate taxes
and insurance costs for the year, and we'll also have the additional expenses related to the Double Play
bulk Internet program which is recorded on a gross basis. These items combine to produce projected
same-store expense growth of 4.25% for the full year at the midpoint. Our forecast also assumes a
modest increase in overall -- of overhead cost, just below 3% for the year, and continued use of our
ATM program to essentially match fund expected acquisitions for the year with $80 million of new equity
issuance projected, of course, assuming we find accretive uses of capital during the year.
And that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments, Priscilla. So now, we'll turn the call back
over to you for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc
Capital Markets.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Brad, you mentioned supply is increasing in your markets in 2020, which I presume is off of your kind of
detailed supply analysis. Could you quantify that thought and tell us which of your top markets are seeing
the biggest increases or decreases?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Yes, Brian -- Austin. It's Tom. I'm going to jump in. Where we really think that we'll see the most pressure
from new supply is in Dallas primarily. It will continue to be challenged, but we're -- but it's -- that supply
is coming in at 45% above our market -- our

[Audio Gap]

and then I think we would expect that Houston, Savannah and Charleston will soften over time as
supply comes online. But feel like we've got Phoenix and Raleigh will probably lead the pack in terms of
performance, and we've also got strong momentum in the face of elevated supply with Austin, Atlanta and
Nashville.

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

And Austin, real quick, just to clarify. When Tom says it's -- supply is coming in 45% on top of us, that's
a rent gap between what we have in place with new supply that's coming in is about 45% higher in rent
than what our assets are.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Yes. That makes sense. And then what's the supply, sort of, for the overall portfolio? What are kind of the
numbers when you compare what it was in 2019 and what you're expecting for this year?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Yes. So if you look at our radius supply as a percent of inventory, we'll -- we -- this 2019 was about 1% of
supply delivered. And this year, it will be 1.6% in 2020.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then kind of going back to the clarification on the rents for units being delivered versus what's
in place. Eric, you've kind of highlighted that across the overall portfolio, I think you said 25%. How does
that 25% compare to the last 2 to 3 years of where new supply was coming in versus where your portfolio
was at the time?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

I don't have those numbers right in front of me, Austin, but we reviewed them, and it's very, very similar
to what it is this year.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

I think as construction costs continued to escalate -- land costs continued to escalate, I think if you go
back over the last several years, you're going to find that that gap is going up. Certainly, the rise in cost of
construction is accelerating at a pace faster than rent growth is accelerating. So I think if you go back over
the last several years, you'll find that that gap is probably spread somewhat.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Neil Malkin with Capital One.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

First question on the operating expense side. You talked about implementing technology through several
of the assets and units across your portfolio. I'm wondering if any of that is also pressuring operating
expenses or is all that being capitalized? And then what are your expectations for payroll and insurance
growth in 2020?

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

Let me make sure I'm understanding. Can you tell me what you -- in the first question, what expenditures
were you talking about specifically, Neil, to make sure I'm clear?

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Yes, yes. So the elevated operating expense this year is mostly related to the bulk Internet program, but I
thought you're also implementing the smart home technology package. Are those...

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. Okay. I know. I got it. Yes, we are, and the majority of that is capital. So just to give you a little
breakdown of the expenses, I think the midpoint, as we talked about, was 4.25% growth for the year, and
about 65 basis points of that is related to the bulk Internet program. And then you have real estate taxes,
which are 1/3 of our expenses, adds probably another 60 basis points. So if you strip all of that out, the
other items, personnel, R&M, utilities, all those things are growing together about 3% for the year.

Tim Argo
Senior VP & Director of Finance

And I'll, Neil, add to that. You mentioned specifically insurance. We're expecting probably low double-digit
increase for our insurance program, which will renew in July.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. Recently, there's been some pretty strong homebuilder confidence. I'm wondering if you're
seeing that play out in any way or anecdotally in terms of the people who are moving out, if they're
moving out to home purchase and -- or if the builders are starting to focus more on the entry-level homes
or still the sort of higher price point homes?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

No. We're not seeing the folks move out for entry-level homes. In fact, move-outs to home buying was
down 10% this quarter, and that's part of what continues to drive our turnover down.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. I guess last one for me. Can you just talk about what cap rates have done, just talk about maybe in
your top 5 markets over the last maybe 6 months for A and -- versus B products?

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

Yes. Neil, this is Brad. I'd say, just broadly speaking, cap rates just continued to decline. I mean certainly,
the demand for multifamily, if you heard anything about the NMHC conference last week where attendance
was up record levels. So I think the demand for multifamily assets continues to be very, very strong.
And every indication we have from selling properties to be very, very active in the acquisition market.
And the numbers we're seeing, cap rates continued to come down. And I'd say the gap between As and
Bs continues to compress, and we don't -- we certainly don't see anything changing the liquidity in the
market that's really driving that at this point.

Operator

We'll go next to Nick Joseph with Citi.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

I'm hoping you can give a little more color on the bulk Internet program. In terms of the contracts with
the providers, how long are those typically? And then from a rental perspective, do all units need to opt in
to the program? Or is there an opportunity to opt in or opt out?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

No. On the first one, they're 5- to 7-year contracts, depends on the provider, and we've got the option to
opt out.

[Audio Gap]

3 years, I believe, but don't hold me into that, Nick.

On the -- as the rollout goes, all residents participate in it. And when we did this -- we've had the bulk
cable program for a while. We had decided to add high-speed Internet access. When we did that, we
looked at our market and who's already subscribing for high-speed Internet access, and 80% of our
residents are already paying for the speed that we're providing or less. So it's an upgrade, and they're
paying less through us for that. Part of the reason that our results were a little better than we expected in
the fourth quarter is, Nick, we really assume that would roll in on new leases on renewals, but the number
of existing residents that chose to opt in, Middle East was higher than we expected.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe to that point, where are you in terms of the rollout? And then how long will
it take to be fully deployed?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

We have one provider done and the next provider underway, and I would think we'd be deployed by May
-- fully deployed by May with some carryover the benefit, of course, into 2020 because they will ramp up
from there.

Operator

We'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Tom, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned current occupancy is at 95.5%, which is 50 basis points
lower than last year. Can you just comment on how concerned you are that occupancy may come in at the
low end of your guidance or potentially lower than that given new supply?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

No, no. As you will have noticed for the last year, we really felt like and continue to feel that with demand,
the way that it is, now is the time to raise rents and build our effective occupancy, and that is the basis for
which our steady rent growth from quarter-to-quarter and the growth that we've seen throughout the year
is built. And we're willing to give up a little bit of occupancy on that, though, 95.5%, very solid from our
perspective. But we feel pretty good about that this time of year. I would expect it to be a little lower, and
I would expect that you'll see that climb as the year goes on. But we're certainly not going to be shooting
for 96.2%, 96.4%. We're very happy in the range that we're in, and it's starting right where we thought it
would.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

And can you provide commentary on how you see job growth or other demand drivers in your markets
this year versus last year?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Yes. I mean job growth, we see no slowdown at this point. And the -- we continue to see interest in the
Sunbelt and in migration trends. Renewal rates continue to stay in the 6% to 7% range right now, though
we anticipate those coming down a bit this year. But right now, demand is very strong. And for that
reason, we'll continue to prioritize rent growth.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And then your development pipeline increased to $490 million this quarter. Can you just comment
on how big you feel comfortable with the pipeline is going forward? And are you developing at any
different spec as far as adding smart home technology or any new technology as part of the development
program?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

This is Eric, John. We're very comfortable where the development pipeline is at this point. I mean we've
established the tolerance that we're very comfortable with the 3% to 4% of enterprise value, which would
put the pipeline tolerance, if you will, at $500 million to $700 million. So at $490 million, we're pretty
comfortable with where it is at this point.

We have several other projects that we're working on now, if you will, in a predevelopment sense. I doubt
we will start anything else this year. We do have a couple of land sites that we either own or are tied up,
but I suspect it will be early '21 before we get those projects going. So we're very comfortable with where
the pipeline is at this point. And yes, as this new product is being developed, the smart home technology
and a lot of the new technology services and products that Tom has alluded to, they will certainly be a part
of what we build going forward.

Yes. We're generally seeing right now that our stabilized yields out of our development are somewhere
in the 100 to 125 basis points higher than what we are capturing on the acquisitions. As Brad alluded to,
The Greene, the deal we bought in Greenville, stabilized yield at just over 5%. We're seeing our -- our
projected stabilized yields on our development pipeline right now trending anywhere from 6% to 6.5%, so
call it 100, 125 basis point spread.

Zachary D. Silverberg
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

All right. And could you provide an update on the quarter and year-to-date lease rates between the legacy
Post portfolio and the MAA portfolio? And is there any extra opportunity that we should view this year
between the 2 of them?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Yes. We do -- we are -- I do not have that information in front of me. We've largely narrowed that gap --
or that gap is narrow, to be honest with you. And differences between Post and Mid-America assets in the
same submarket are negligible. Now going forward, as I touched on with our redevelopment program and
amenity upgrade, we do still have opportunities in those very strong locations to update the exterior and
amenity packages there. And that is more of a 2021 impact that we'll see from the work that we do this
year.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Tom is referring to the Post -- legacy Post locations for the upgrade. So we'll probably see more robust
rent growth emerge out of Post, but it's more a function of the upgrade as opposed to market differences.

Operator

We'll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Tom, so same-store revenue guidance is 3.25% to 4.25%. What do you expect -- where are you expecting
your top markets to come out? Where are you expecting the bottom performers to come out? What's the
sort of spread that underpins that 3.75% midpoint.

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

I mean Rob,

[Audio Gap]

that range to be on a blended basis. The top markets in that -- probably in that 4%, 4.5% range, and the
bottom markets in the 2%, 2.5%, something like that. I'm estimating that, to be honest with you, but
that's rough feedback.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Okay. So nobody is sort of close to flat or even negative or anything? It's all sort of at least 1%, 1.5%
positive at the bottom end?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Correct. I think on a blended basis, we would expect to get a full year traction and not have many people
go backwards.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

And Rob, I'll tell you -- this is Eric. I mean to some degree, the opportunity that we carry from 2019 into
2020 because of the focus on prioritization on rent growth, it really puts us in a much better position to
work through some of the supply pressures in these markets in 2020 and really enables us to avoid any of
the real weak performance metrics that you might -- you were alluding to as a possibility. I think that we
knew heading into this year that we likely would see some moderation of some sort occur. And that was
part of the reason behind the logic of focusing so intently on the rent growth last year, which really helps
us this year.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Where are you guys -- on that topic, I mean how are you guys thinking about turnover for 2020? I mean
it was only 47% last year. I mean are you anticipating it being sort of flattish? You're expecting more
contraction, some re-expansion there? And how big of a benefit is that to you if it stays low from an
earnings standpoint?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Yes. As far as our expectation, we expect it to be up slightly. We don't see any fundamental changes
coming across the board. But it is honestly hard to assume that it will continue to drop, and that plays into
our earnings forecast really minimally at this point. Al may add some color.

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. If you look at what we've got dialed in for occupancy, we've given ourselves about 15 basis points
decline. There's a little bit of increase in turnover implied in that, but nothing significant, I would say.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then did I hear you guys correctly that you're going to do 24,000 smart home unit installs in
2020?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

That is correct, Rob.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. And what is the cost for that? How much are you doing per unit?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

The average cost on that is $1,300 on the install, and that gives you locks, thermostat, 2 lights, 2
moisture sensors and a interactive flat panel display, the resident interface as well as their app.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

And just one thing that's important, I think, in doing your model, Rob, there, the smart home program
plus the amenity redevelopments that Tom's talked about, we're investing about $60 million in capital this
year in that, which is very strong returns, but a lot of that will begin to come more strongly in 2021.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. So I mean in terms of units, though, that you redevelop in 2020, instead of being 6,000, is that
going to be wrapped up? Or is that going to be separate? So in other words, are you going from essentially
6,000 to 7,500 a unit on the redevelopment? Or I assume there might be some sort of cost savings if
you've got to open up walls and do whatever, anyway. But I mean is that going to be wrapped up into a
higher redevelopment per unit cost for the whatever number of units you do redevelopment into your full-
scale redevelopment on?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Sure. And Rob, those programs are separate. And the reason that they are separate is because the timing
is different in them. And if you'll remember on the kitchen and bath redevelopment, we do that on turn.
When we install smart homes, we go in and we do the whole property at one time and then move people
on to the product. So those programs are independent of one another.

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

And that's really why I mentioned them, Rob, this is Al. If you think about it, the program that we've
done for many years into our redevelopment part will continue along at basically at the same pace, call
it, 7,000 to 8,000 units at $5,000 to $6,000 per unit spending on that. And it's been the same level,
and that will have a constant contribution to earnings growth. On top of that are the 2 programs that
Tom's mentioning: the amenity redevelopment and of course a smart home. And those together, about
an additional $60 million that are great investments that will begin to pay off more in 2020, and that was
really the point, as you model it, to help you lay that in right.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then just last one for me, Al. Property taxes especially elevated in any specific market?

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

It continues to be the same offenders. I mean what we have this year -- when you're beginning in the
year, you don't know a lot. We'll go back to that, Rob. And what we do know is about 1/3 of our portfolio is
a revaluation year. We continue to expect pressure in Florida, Texas, maybe North Carolina a little bit this
year. So we've dialed that in. And so we -- overall, we do expect our costs to come down a little bit. The
4% to 5% range as 4.5% point is about 50 basis points down. And also we're cautiously optimistic about
some of the changes in Texas, the new law changes. Hard to know where that's going to play out over the
next few years. You don't yet know how that's going to affect both millage rates or valuations. So we've
dialed in what we think we're going to have. And over time, we're hopeful that that line begins to come
down a bit, but 4.5% for 2020 is our expectation.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

I actually wanted to touch up on supply again. The way we look at it, it doesn't seem to be as impactful as
maybe you've mentioned. Beyond Dallas and Houston, the 2 markets that you highlighted, can you give us
a sense for supply in your, maybe secondary, tertiary markets and how that's shaping up?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Sure. Probably the market with the -- in the secondary group with the largest impact is probably
Charleston, moving from 2.3% as a percent of inventory to 4.8%. Now we're a little encouraged by that
because the -- where the supply has been, where it lines up to our A assets is in Mount Pleasant, and the
Mount Pleasant moratoriums are finally taking in effect. And so while Charleston has seen higher, that
supply has moved to the Upper Peninsula area, which, as you know, is across the Ravenel Bridge from
Mount Pleasant. So we're a little bit optimistic there. But again, we see Charlotte at 2.5% to 3.7%. Others
in the secondary market are -- Greenville goes from 2.1% of supply to 2.3%, so not a lot of change there.

Probably the other market that has the biggest increase delta between '19 to '20 is in Savannah, Georgia.
In 2019, they delivered 3% of the existing supply -- market supply into the market. In 2020, that jumps
to 7%. Now you'll recognize Savannah is only 2% of our same-store NOI, so it's not a huge impact, but
it's kind of hit or miss. Some are up a little bit. Some are up or more than others. But because of the
diversified nature of our capital across these, particularly the secondary markets, we -- it's not particularly
significant, but it varies a bit by market.

Hardik Goel
Zelman & Associates LLC

And just one quick follow-up. Could you share the new and renewal for the quarter?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

Yes, sure. The new for the quarter was 90 basis points down; renewal, 7% up, a blended 2.6%, which was
100 basis points better than last year.

Operator

We'll take our next question today from Rich Anderson with SMBC.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division

So last year, your same-store growth sort of cadence kind of climbed over the course of the year from
2.5% on NOI line to 5% to end the year in the fourth quarter. I'm wondering if that means sort of a mirror
image in 2020, where you start the year somewhat stronger than you ended on the basis of increasingly
tougher comps.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I mean certainly, I think the prior year comparisons will be a little bit more challenging for us this
year. A lot of the momentum that we had last year was a function of our clear focus that we had going into
last year about focusing on rent growth at the expense of a little occupancy give-up, and that momentum
built over the course of the year. So I think that -- and which is really helping us this year as we carry a lot
of that momentum that baked in, if you will, into 2020.

We do think that as a result of some of the supply issues in a number of markets that our lease-over-lease
pricing, if you will, the more current pricing that's occurring in 2020 will be off a little bit from the trends
that we saw in 2019. But a combination of the carryforward that we have from last year and the plans
that we have this year,still offer up a blended lease-over-lease pricing performance for 2020 at 3.4%.
So we think that's off a little bit from last year, but 3.4% of blended pricing performance in 2020 in the
face of some of the supply pressures that we see on some of these markets, we feel pretty good about

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

15

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

that actually and still with strong occupancy that we think we'll capture as well. So I think these markets
continue to show resiliency because of the strong demand and our portfolio, in particular, because of the
diversified nature of the markets that we're in.

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

I'll just add to give the -- how it's slated into our projections that support that, what Eric was saying is, all
quarters in this year is going to be a little more stable, just because of where we are. And all quarters are
sort of in that 3.5% to 4% revenue range for the year. And so second and third quarter, maybe a little bit
higher, but it's -- they're all in that range, much more stable.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

I'll add one point, even though the blended pricing is a little bit lower in '20. As the smart home and the
bulk Internet start to take hold, it helps the back half of the year a little more than certainly the first half.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. In terms of the external growth sort of projections for this year, obviously more on the
acquisitions, how much of that is sort of this prepurchase opportunity? And how much of that is cost of
capital that's making deals work a bit more easily in 2020 versus previous years?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I mean we think that it's more likely than not that the vast majority of the acquisitions that we do
will be some prepurchases of things to be built. We may -- particularly as you get towards the back half of
the year, we see the opportunity set improve a little bit for buying lease-up deals as we get closer to year-
end and developers or owners get a little bit more motivated to get some things done.

But certainly, our cost of capital has improved, and it does, at the margin, generate a little bit more
flexibility in this regard. But at the end of the day, I mean we're really driven by can we deploy the capital
and create a stabilized yield on that investment that's going to be accretive to our existing earnings
profile, and that's what really drives our mindset. We pay attention obviously to our cost of capital, but
just the idea that there's all of a sudden a better spread opportunity in and of itself is not what compels us
to go out and start putting money to work. We want to be sure we're adding earning assets that are going
to be accretive to the existing earnings profile of the company.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division

So declining cost of capital doesn't mean you're willing to take a lower yield? Or does it influence your
underwriting?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

No. It really doesn't. We do not want to begin to just take on a bunch of lower-yielding investments, just
simply because the cost of capital is adjusted as it has. We're trying to compile a long-term earnings
growth profile for the company, and we're trying to protect that long-term earnings growth profile. And
just adding a bunch of low-earning investments, just because our cost of capital happens to be where it is
really runs counter to that long-term objective.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division

Well, I mean you'd say lower cap rates sometimes lead to higher growth in the second year of ownership,
but that's just another observation.

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

It can.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division

Anyway, last question for me. I appreciate the positive wrap you're putting around the supply, which -- it
makes sense to me in terms of premium relative to where your rents are. But clearly, you'd rather not be
the case, right? I mean this is making the best of a not so great situation from a supply perspective. With
concessions that can be offered, newer product and a strong job market, people might have a willingness
to entertain optionality. So in your mind, while you see some opportunity out of the supply picture, what
is the risk, though, that this could actually have -- be more damaging when you consider the health of the
job markets in your neck of the woods?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, certainly, I think the supply picture and the supply pressure as -- and we've talked about, it does
create some short-term pressure. And as evidenced in our guidance, I mean we assume that our lease-
over-lease pricing in 2020 on a blended basis runs about 100 basis points below 2019. So there's no
question that you get into these heavier supply scenarios, particularly where there's leasing concessions
coming into the market, that there is some short-term pressure generated. And as I mentioned, that can
vary quite a bit by market. And in a bigger market, like in Dallas, you're going to see more pressure than
you are in a smaller market like in Greenville, South Carolina. And that's why we tend to be very focused
in our efforts to deploy capital across the region in both large and secondary markets in an effort to --
something you'll remember, Rich, in an effort to get our full cycle performance profile that we're after. So
I certainly acknowledge and we do that there is going to be some near-term pressure from some of the
supply. We've got that dialed in, we think, appropriately into our guidance.

But I will tell you the fact that a lot of this new high-priced product is coming into our locations, we
think that, long term, that's a good thing. It says good things about our neighborhood. It says good
things about the value of the real estate in those neighborhoods, and it creates the opportunities that we
alluded to, to continue over the next few years to get some, not only good rent growth because of the
improvement we're making in the assets, but also great returns on our capital. This is the most accretive
use of money that we have right now is these redevelopment initiatives. So we'll deal with a little short-
term pressure, but the long-term value play is pretty darn attractive.

Operator

We'll move next to Drew Babin with Baird.

Andrew T. Babin
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

A quick follow-on question to Rob's question earlier on the Texas tax revenue caps. It sounds to me like
that is not baked into your same-store expense guidance range at all. It seems like maybe a longer-term
benefit. Is that true? Or is there any kind of directional benefit that's beginning to influence guidance
there?

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

No. I mean I think we've dialed in what we think is going to be our best estimate at this point, Drew. I
mean the cap is not at a taxpayer level. It is at the market level. And so I think there are still some things
to be worked at exactly how that's going to play to each individual asset, the valuation, even the millage
rates that we get in the year for all of the markets.

17

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

So we've dialed in what we think it's going to be. I think -- what we would say is, over time, hopefully,
those walls are helpful in restraining the fast growth of taxes in Texas. That's hard to say, taxes in Texas.
But I think in the short term, it's yet to be seen exactly what it's going to play out. And so to Eric's point,
we put our best estimate on that.

Andrew T. Babin
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And one follow-up on the same-store revenue buildup, blended leasing spreads from '19, blended
leasing spread in guidance, marrying that with the occupancy guidance, Double Play impact, it would seem
like the revenue buildup goes towards the high end of guidance, which I would surmise there's maybe
some other ancillary-type items that may be a little flatter and dragging on that, which that was a trend
kind of throughout 2019 as well. Can you talk about what kind of the growth in other -- aside from the
Double Play, what was that other income growth in '19? What will it be in '20? And is there anything going
on in that to kind of drive new other income into 2021, anything else you're kind of doing?

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

I think the easiest way to do that -- quickest way maybe, Drew, is to just say talk about what our growth
would've been, our guidance would've been without the -- assuming the bulk Internet program this year.
And we would've had a midpoint range somewhere around 3.2%, growth revenues; 3.6% for operating
expenses; and 3% for NOI. And then so you have the bulk Internet program on top of that, and so that
can kind of help you.

And I think the 3.2% on revenue is the combination of the rents that we put on the table this year. The
3.4% blended lease that we expect to get, combined with what we did last year, that's helpful. Giving up
a little bit on occupancy, 15 basis points or so. And then the other fee income items, other than the bulk
Internet, the reimbursement items and trash, pest fee, other items, they're expected to be flat with last
year, essentially, which when your growth rate lugs a little bit gets you down to that 3.2% expectation for
the year. And then on expenses, we talked about the 3.6%. And really everything, but real estate taxes,
would have been about 3%. So I hope that's helpful and gives you what you're looking for.

Andrew T. Babin
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And it sounds like the Double Play program is being implemented kind of fairly rapidly, and so the
benefits will be kept mostly in 2020. Is there anything else you're doing on the other income side that
might help '21 kind of coming off of that '20 comp? Any other additional parking fees, things like that?
Anything else kind of in the hopper that's being worked on? Or the technology element, might that move
the needle as well?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I would tell you that a lot of the Double Play, I mean we're going to roll it out over the course -- first
half this year, but I really the full year benefit will be more next year.

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

It's about half this year and half next year because while we deploy it and will be deployed in May,
residents have to sign up for it when they do on leasing renewal.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

I think that that's going to build up over this year, and we'll see more benefit in 2021. The other thing,
though, that Al alluded to, and we've talked about here is this repositioning effort that we're doing with
Double Play and with the more enhanced amenity upgrades. What's happening is we're investing a lot of

18

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

that capital this year, this calendar year 2020. And the real rent growth from that will actually emerge in
2021. So that's really what's at play here. A lot of that benefit will play out next year, not this year.

Operator

We'll take our next question from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.

Richard Wynn Skidmore
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

Eric, you mentioned in your prepared comments some new initiatives in 2020. Perhaps I missed them, but
can you just perhaps speak to what those new initiatives are that you're focused on in 2020?

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Tom can jump in here. I mean now it's the bulk Double Play initiative, the high-speed Internet
program that we're rolling out was what I was referencing. We've got the more -- the smart home
technology implementation that we're going to be rolling out this year. And then as I was just mentioning,
we've got some repositioning opportunities with some of the legacy Post assets that we'll be rolling out
this year and are working on this year. And as I was just mentioning -- and then as Tom alluded to, there's
some other new technologies, the AI chat and some other things that were self-touring and other things
that we'll be testing out later this year. We don't really expect any impact this year, but we're going to
continue to evaluate those programs for possible implementation in 2021.

Operator

And we'll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Maybe just a follow-up to your response to Drew's question. So it sounds like if the rollout for the Double
Play Internet goes as expected, the NOI contribution or the NOI lift in 2021 is greater than the 50 bps in
2020. Is that accurate?

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

More comparable, I would say. I mean we're rolling out -- there's 2-phase program -- 2 major providers
that we're dealing. And in 2020, we'll have full bear of one of those providers and be building the second
one. So I would say probably something -- it wouldn't increase. It might be something comparable.

H. Eric Bolton
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I think equal, maybe slightly a little less since we've got the biggest provider in line now, and we're
working on the rest of the portfolio.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then Tom, listening to your comments on which markets you think will lead the pack and which
markets may lag. Is it a fair read that your -- as an aggregate, the smaller or secondary markets will be
below average in terms of same-store revenue growth?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

I don't have them split exactly that way, but we've got some encouraging places on both sides of that
equation. So I think we are the -- probably the runaway leaders are Phoenix and Raleigh. But I'll tell you,

19

MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Birmingham, Huntsville and Memphis have been pretty solid players for us, and we would expect that to
continue.

John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then final one for me, if I could sneak it in there. Do you see revenue growth had been
accelerating nicely for you year-over-year, last few quarters and then slowed meaningfully this quarter.
So is there anything idiosyncratic this quarter that hit the D.C. market? Or are the fundamental slowing in
your eyes in the market?

Thomas L. Grimes
Executive VP & COO

We don't believe the fundamentals are slowing. It's really a comparison between the prior year, the 2
quarters. So last -- in the third quarter, we had a 30 basis point occupancy comparison tailwind that juiced
revenues a little bit. In this quarter and the fourth quarter of '18, we were at 96.6%, and we're 96% this
go around. So we had a 60 basis point headwind.

Operator

And we'll take our final question today from John Guinee with Stifel.

Aaron Brett Wolf
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

This is Aaron Wolf on for John. Two quick questions. Can you provide any detail on the price per unit on
the Greenville asset that you recently acquired and also on the Little Rock, Arkansas portfolio?

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

Yes. So this is Brad here. Let me give the details of that up in front of me. So the price per unit on the
Greenville deal -- excuse me, make sure I get you the right number there. So that was 268 (sic) [ 271 ]
unit for the Greenville deal, which, as we said a moment ago, was a 5.1% cap rate on that asset. And I'm
sorry, your second question?

Aaron Brett Wolf
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Little Rock.

A. Bradley Hill
Executive VP & Director of Multifamily Investing

Yes. So our Little Rock assets, we sold -- the total price there was just under $150 million.

[Audio Gap]

and it was $109,000 a unit.

Aaron Brett Wolf
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. And one -- that's helpful. And one last for me. You may have disclosed this already. I
apologize if you did, but the average share price on the ATM activity in the quarter.

Albert M. Campbell
Executive VP & CFO

You can get from the press release, the proceeds and the shares, that's around $136 a share, I believe, is
what that will come to.
