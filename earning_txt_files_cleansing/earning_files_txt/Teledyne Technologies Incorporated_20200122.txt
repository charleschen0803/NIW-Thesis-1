TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Teledyne Fourth Quarter Earnings
Release Conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jason VanWees. Please go ahead.

Jason VanWees
Executive Vice President of Strategy, Margin Improvement Programs , Mergers & Acquisitions

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Jason VanWees, Executive Vice President, and I want to
welcome everyone to Teledyne's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Release Conference call. We
released our earnings earlier this morning before the market open.

Joining me today are Teledyne's Executive Chairman, Robert Mehrabian; President and CEO, Al Pichelli;
Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; and SVP, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and
Secretary, Melanie Cibik. After remarks by Robert, Al, Sue, we will ask for questions.

Of course, though, before we get started, our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-
looking statements made this morning are subject to various risks and caveats as noted in the earnings
release and our periodic SEC filings. And in order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call
is simultaneously being webcast, and a replay, both via webcast and dial in, will be available for
approximately 1 month.

Here is Robert.

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. For the
second consecutive quarter, we achieved all-time record sales, earnings per share and free cash flow.
Likewise, full year 2019 was by any measure a record year, each of sales, earnings, GAAP operating
margin and free cash flow were all-time records. Fourth quarter and full year sales increased 11.5% and
9%, respectively. Organic growth for both periods also exceeded 4%, including some modest currency
headwinds about 0.6% in Q4 and about 1% headwind for the full year 2019. In addition, for both the
fourth quarter and full year, GAAP operating margin expanded just under 120 basis points.

Fourth quarter earnings were $3.06, exceeding $3 per share for the first time, an increase of 24.9%
compared to last year. While we've increased our emphasis on margin improvement, we are continuing our
proven strategy of disciplined capital deployment for compound growth in earnings and cash flow.

In 2019, we deployed $484 million on complementary acquisitions. And earlier this month, we announced
the acquisition of OakGate Technology, a software and hardware company focused on the test, validation
and operating performance of solid-state electronic storage media. This is our third bolt-on acquisition for
Teledyne LeCroy and allows Teledyne to provide a complete set of protocol analysis software and hardware
used from the design of new data storage devices to the use of search devices in hyperscale cloud storage
networks.

Teledyne continues to benefit from our balanced portfolio of common technologies serving different
complementary market. We begin 2020 with growth in our defense businesses expected to offset declines
in sales of OEM avionics. Marine instrumentation continues to recover, with growing sales, but also with
orders having exceeded sales for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Digital Imaging, we expect to see
continued strength in certain high-growth markets like micro electromechanical system or MEMS and a
modest recovery in certain commercial machine vision market, such as the semiconductor industry.

TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

Given the short-cycle nature of our environmental and electronic test and measurement instrumentation
businesses, at this point, we're only projecting low single-digit GDP-like organic growth.

Finally, our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong, with the quarter end leverage ratio of 1.4x, and
we're continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities.

Before turning the call to Al, I want to emphasize that all of our financial results this morning are reported
on a GAAP basis with no adjustments for amortization, stock compensation, acquisition charges, purchase
accounting, restructuring or other charges.

I will now -- Al will now comment on the performance of our 4 business segments.

Aldo Pichelli
President & CEO

Thank you, Robert. In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 14.5% from
last year. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 14.7% organically in the quarter. And we also closed
2019 with the highest year-end backlog since 2014. In addition, operating profit improved significantly.

In the environmental domain, sales increased 31.9% as a result of our recent acquisition of the Gas and
Flame Detection business. In addition, greater organic sales of pollution control instrumentation were
offset by lower sales of selected process gas analyzers and laboratory instruments.

Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased sequentially to the highest level of 2019, but
decreased 6.8% year-over-year given an especially tough comparison. For the full year, sales increased
6% organically.

Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 38.4% in the quarter, and margin increased
340 basis points, with margins increasing for test and measurement and marine instrumentation.
Excluding the Gas and Flame Detection acquisition and related purchase accounting, margins also
increased within the environmental instrumentation.

Turning to the Digital Imaging segment. Fourth quarter sales increased 20.1%. Sales of our proprietary
medical and dental X-ray detectors, again increased significantly year-over-year. Sales of geospatial
sensor systems and MEMS devices also grew nicely, as did sales of advanced infrared and invisible light
detectors for defense and space applications.

The strong growth in these businesses more than offset some expected declines in the portion of our
industrial machine vision business, which serves consumer electronics and generally factory automation
markets, especially in Asia. However, sales of these products did increase sequentially, given some recent
recovery in the semiconductor-related inspection systems. GAAP segment operating profit increased
29.8% and margin increased 131 basis points generally as a result of the increased sales volume.

In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, fourth quarter sales increased 2.7%, primarily due
to strong growth across the majority of our Defense Electronics businesses partially offset by lower sales
of OEM aerospace electronics. Segment operating margin decreased 208 basis points to 19.2%. The
operating margin primarily resulted from product mix differences in Defense Electronics and lower sales of
commercial avionics.

In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue decreased 1.7%, with greater sales related
to space and energy programs, electronic manufacturing and turbine engines, more than offset by lower
sales from missile defense programs and energy systems. Segment operating profit and margin was flat
year-to-year.

Before turning to Sue, I want to offer some additional commentary regarding our 2020 outlook. Given the
points raised by Robert earlier, we believe that total organic revenue growth into full year 2020 will be
3% to 3.5%. In addition, the full year contribution from the scientific camera, Gas and Flame Detection,
Micralyne and OakGate acquisition will add another $100 million or so of incremental revenue. This
translate to total revenue of approximately $3.36 billion to $3.37 billion for 2020.

TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

I will now turn the call over to Sue.

Susan L. Main
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter
not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss the first quarter and full year 2020 outlook.

In the fourth quarter, record cash flow from operating activities was $167.9 million compared with cash
flow of $125.5 million for the same period of 2018. The cash provided by operating activities in the fourth
quarter of 2019 reflected the impact of higher operating income, cash flow from recent acquisitions and
improved working capital management.

Free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was $144 million in the
fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $106.8 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were $23.9 million in
the fourth quarter compared to $18.7 million for the same period of 2018.

Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million in both the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018.
We ended the quarter with $651.1 million of net debt, that is $850.6 million of debt less cash of $199.5
million for a net debt-to-capital ratio of 19.4%. Stock option compensation expense was $5.7 million in the
fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Turning to our outlook. Management currently believes that GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter
of 2020 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share. And for the full year 2020, our GAAP earnings
per share outlook is $11.20 to $11.30. The 2020 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items, is
expected to be 22.3%, a 170 basis point increase compared to full year 2019 due in part to less R&D tax
credits as a percentage of taxable income. In addition, we currently expect significantly less discrete items
in 2020 compared with 2019.

I will now pass the call back to Robert.

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman
Thank you, Sue. We'd now like to take your questions. Greg, if you're ready to proceed with the questions
and answers, please go ahead.

TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

I was hoping you could dig a little bit more into marine. So you're on your second quarter now of what
looks like the beginning of a ramp. How sustainable is this -- is the growth into next year? And then can
you also talk a little bit about -- I would think, given you got marine finally rebounding here, you got
potentially machine vision rebounding here, I would think that your organic growth rate guidance will be
higher than that 3%, I believe you said 3%, 3.5%. So what's -- can you talk about how that's weighing it
down or what's weighing it down?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Sure, Andrew. Let me start with Marine. I think our orders in marine were significant this year. We ended
the year with about 1.1% in terms of book-to-bill. The -- it's been a good run. There are -- the oil prices
hovered between $55 and $65 for Brent, and a lot of deepwater production is profitable below $50. So
we're seeing both improvements in our seismic activities and the activities for oil exploration as well as
long-term oil production contracts. We think that in 2020, marine would have increased revenues in the
range of about 6.6% versus 4% in 2019.

Now continuing with the second part of your question, which is why we have organic growth less than 4%
or so. This year, we achieved [ about ] 4.4%. We're projecting between 3% and 3.5% for next year, that's
primarily affected by the 737MAX. It impacts our revenues by 1%. That's our best guess right now, which
is equivalent to about $30 million. We anticipated that we would have revenues of over $40 million, maybe
as much as $45 million. And because of the delays that you're very familiar with, we expect that, that
would be down about -- affect our revenue about 1% or $30 million.

Having said that, I think it's important that -- to note that with even that hit that we're taking in our
revenue because of our balanced portfolio, even in the Aerospace and Defense segment, we expect
revenue to be flat year-over-year because the defense businesses are going to do much better this year
than they did last year. So the answer to your question is primarily driven by MAX. When it comes back
into production, we'll pick it up again.

Andrew Edouard Buscaglia
Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG, Research Division

Yes. No, that's helpful. And maybe could you just comment, too, on the -- you said machine vision in the
quarter seems to -- you got a little uptick sequentially here. What's your expectation for 2020? I mean
you got semis markets moving higher or just good commentary out of those markets. So what are you
guys thinking?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Right now, we think that in the machine vision that we will get some pickup from semi. We think for the
year, we'll probably organically grow 3% to 3.5%, but we also made an acquisition, a sci cam acquisition,
last year as well as Micralyne, et cetera. I think overall, machine vision would be over 5%, maybe 5.1%
[ to ] 5.2%. The Digital Imaging that includes machine vision is recovering modestly. Where we've done
well really is in the health care, which is our X-ray business and our MEMS areas. And we think those
areas will help us as well.

TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

We think the sales in that whole Digital Imaging will increase from what was this year about $900 million
-- to about $990 million -- I'm sorry, $900 million -- to about [ $1.4 billion, $1.450 billion ]. So -- I mean
$1,045,000,000. And so we're positive about machine vision. Of course, it is -- if the business picks up
more, especially in the flat panel displays, then we'll do better.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Robert, you answered a bunch of my questions there. But maybe can we just talk about margins a little
bit? And how much -- how dilutive was the M&A in the quarter? And how much is -- how dilutive do you
have it into 2020 margins, and maybe we can get a little color on margins by segment there?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Yes. I can give you margins first, if I may, by segment and related to '19. Let me start with
Instrumentation. Instrumentation had full year margin of about 18.1% and that was really good because
it improved about 370 basis points over 2018. We think that will go up again in 2020, perhaps as much as
70 basis points. Right now, we always think it will end up at 18.8%. And moving to Digital Imaging, Digital
Imaging margins were flat year-over-year at '18 was 17.8% and '19 was 17.8%. We think we're going to
get some margin improvement there, perhaps as much as 65 basis points. Aerospace and Defense and
Engineered Systems, we don't think we're going to improve margins. Aerospace and Defense, primarily
because the margins are already pretty high at 20.8%, but also, as I mentioned because of the headwind
from 737MAX, we think even though defense will make up for the revenue, margins will stay flat. And in
Engineered Systems, we think margins would remain about 9.7%. So overall, in the segment, we think
that the margins will increase overall; about 45% -- or 45 basis points, and the company as a whole, it will
be about 50 basis points.

Regarding the question you asked about dilution -- appreciation, dilution from the acquisitions, the Roper
acquisition was the scientific cameras was not dilutive. Right now, gas and flame, which is the business
we bought from 3M and Micralyne, which we bought, we think they will add about -- they added about
50 basis points in dilution, probably in Q4. Now we think going forward, they will be flat. Most of our
acquisitions that we make maybe dilutive at very early on because of the expenses we have in acquiring
them, but after a while, they're accreted.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

That's very helpful. Just wanted to clarify, I think you said earlier, marine up about 6.5% in 2020. What
about the oil and gas, the energy component of marine specifically? I just want to make sure I'm -- I
wasn't confusing which things you're talking about there?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Yes. Let me just point that out. I think in the oil and gas -- first, let me start with a big picture. This year,
we ended marine at about $450 million, which was a 3.9% improvement over '18. Our present plans or
our present anticipation is that, that will go up 6.6% to $480 million. Of that, the oil and gas in 2019 was
about $185 million, and we think that will increase to $202 million, a healthy increase for us. And we think
the rest of marine, which is -- has to do with defense and security and other things that will go up from
$265 million to $278 million. So to put it in a nutshell, the 6.6% is balance between oil and gas and the
other businesses, especially defense, where we do have really good programs, especially in the submarine
area.

TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 22, 2020

So maybe last for me. On the health care part of Digital Imaging, that business has been great for you
guys. And what's the outlook and kind of current thoughts around new customers and new fields like on
surgery and mammography? And what's the -- what's kind of the pacing in discussions with big customers
there and what's embedded in your guidance for growth in health care in 2020?

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

We think we're going to have a little growth in health care, but it's not going to be as robust as we had
in 2020 because we had a lot of new OEMs sign up in 2020, and we don't see any new OEMs right now.
It could happen, but we don't see it right now. We have -- in prior years, we had really good extraoral
surgery, we had good intraoral, we had mammography. So we think it's going to be relatively flat, maybe
increase another $10 million year-over-year. I think last year, it was about $255 million. We are projecting
by about $265 million or so this year. But it's a healthy business. And we're trying to also move up market
with some of our products. So as the year progresses, I think we'll be able to project improvements,
especially in mammography and other OEMs as we move closer to 2021.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And at this time, there are no further questions.

Robert Mehrabian
Executive Chairman

Well, thank you very much, Greg. What I'd like to do is ask Jason to conclude the conference call. Thank
