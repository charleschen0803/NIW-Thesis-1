Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Paycom Software Second Quarter
2020 Quarterly Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, James Samford, Head of Investor
Relations for Paycom. Please go ahead.

James Samford
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, and welcome to Paycom's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

Certain statements made on this call that are not historical facts, including those related to our future
plans, objectives and expected performance are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook
only as of the date of this conference call. While we believe any forward-looking statements made on this
call are reasonable, actual results may differ materially because the statements are based on our current
expectations and subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our
filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly
report on Form 10-Q. You should refer to and consider these factors when relying on such forward-looking
information. Any forward-looking statements made speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we
do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

Also during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA,
non-GAAP net income, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin and certain adjusted expenses. We
use these non-GAAP financial measures to review and assess our performance and for planning purposes.
A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is included in the press release that we
issued after the close of the market today and is available on our website at investors.paycom.com.

I'll now turn the call over to Chad Richison, Paycom's President and Chief Executive Officer. Chad?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Thanks, James. And thank you to everyone joining our call today. I want to thank our employees who
continue to thrive in this ever-changing environment.

For today's call, I'll spend a few minutes on our second quarter 2020 results and some notable trends.
Following that, Craig will review our financials and provide some perspective on guidance. And then we'll
take questions.

I'm very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and the demand we are seeing. As expected,
our second quarter results were impacted by the headwinds we outlined in our last call, namely the impact
of unemployment across our current client base due to the pandemic and a 150 basis point cut in interest
rates in March. Despite these headwinds, we continued to see very strong lead volume and new business
sales achievements, which have set us up very well for the future.

Q2 revenue and adjusted EBITDA came in at $181.6 million and $61.2 million, respectively. While we
expected there to be similarities between the increase in the unemployment rate and the impact on our
client base, we now know the actual impact on our client base even as unemployment has fluctuated
throughout the quarter. Headcount reductions at our clients and the impact on current client revenue
peaked at the end of April and began to stabilize.

PAYCOM SOFTWARE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Based on the trends we've seen throughout the second quarter, we estimate the impact on current
client recurring revenue is a loss of approximately $2 million per week. Interest rate cuts added another
$350,000 in weekly lost recurring revenues. We've seen these numbers stabilize at these rates for over
the last few months, thus making the impact on our revenue more predictable. I'm pleased we are in a
position to provide Q3 guidance, which Craig will walk you through shortly.

We began the second quarter with strong demand and elevated lead volumes driven by our deliberate
investments in advertising. Q2 demo leads were roughly 3x higher than in the comparable prior year
quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, the pandemic is exposing seams created by disparate HCM systems.
And the increasing trend towards a more autonomous workforce is creating high demand for the Paycom
single database solution. We believe the value proposition of our solution is stronger than ever, and we
continue to see success in both outbound and inbound sales efforts. Our sales teams continue to operate
in a virtual model without disruption, and they had strong success in Q2. We continue to see strong
usage patterns of our products as measured by our Direct Data Exchange or DDX. With the increasing
importance of working autonomously, it is critical that companies enable their employees to have a direct
relationship with the database. With Paycom, the employee wins from an easier and more comprehensive
experience, and the company wins from real savings.

Throughout the second quarter, we continued to invest in product development and released several
thousand product enhancements. One product that continued to be enhanced during the quarter was
Manager on-the-Go. This tool is built in the Paycom's existing mobile app and empowers leaders with 24/7
accessibility to essential manager-side functionality of our solution. Manager on-the-Go continues to be
widely adopted by managers across our client base, with already almost 90% of our clients deploying
it in just the first 5 months since launch. Manager on-the-Go is transforming manager workloads and
accelerating the speed that data moves throughout the system, which further increases the ROI of
our solution and sets up future usage patterns that pave the way for future product innovation and
automation.

Going forward, we will continue to remain focused on 3 controllable activities: providing world-class
service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies, and increasing the number of new clients
added to our platform. I'm very pleased with the execution we have delivered on all 3 of these fronts to
date, which I believe will further strengthen our market position in the quarters and years to come.

We are overcoming the revenue headwind created by the pandemic. As I'm sure many of you have seen
our commercials on TV and our advertising assets online, we have spent more in advertising in Q2 than
we've ever spent in a single quarter by a significant margin. This advertising spend, coupled with our
world-class sales organization, yielded great results for us in the second quarter. In fact, Q2 was our best
quarter ever from a new business sales perspective by a large margin. And we will continue to spend
aggressively on advertising throughout Q3 and Q4 above the Q2 levels as we deliver our value proposition
to our massive target market. With less than 5% of the total addressable market already captured, we
have a long way to go. The digital transformation for business is accelerating, and our investment in
expanding our market share is working. I'll stop there and hand it over to Craig to review our financials
and guidance. Craig?

Craig E. Boelte
CFO, Treasurer & Corporate Secretary

Thanks, Chad. Before I review our second quarter 2020 results, I would like to remind everyone that
my comments related to certain financial measures will be on a non-GAAP basis. I'll briefly cover our
Q2 results and trends, and I'll provide some high-level comments about Q3 guidance. Our approach is
to be as transparent as possible based on what we know now. And we believe there has been enough
predictability in the impact of the pandemic on our current client revenue to provide near-term guidance.

Before turning to the results, I want to briefly discuss the environment we faced in Q2. During the second
quarter, our analysis of the impact of the pandemic was that declining employment rates at our existing
clients became progressively worse and hit a low point at the end of April and then stabilized. We estimate
that the effect of lower headcount at our clients on our current client revenue is a loss of approximately
$2 million in weekly recurring revenue as of today. We also experienced the impact of 150 basis point

PAYCOM SOFTWARE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

interest rate cuts that occurred in March, which amounts to a loss of roughly $350,000 in weekly recurring
revenue.

Despite these anticipated headwinds, demand for our solution continues to strengthen, and we had
increasing new client sales that were solidly ahead of pre-COVID sales levels. That success has continued
into Q3 with accelerating demand and sales trends that are layering in nicely on top of our current client
recurring revenue base.

With that as a backdrop, I'll turn to the results. In the second quarter, we generated total revenues of
$181.6 million, representing growth of roughly 7% over the comparable prior year period driven by strong
new business wins. Within total revenues, recurring revenue was $178 million for the second quarter of
2020, representing 98% of total revenues for the quarter.

Total adjusted gross profit for the second quarter was $153.8 million, representing adjusted gross margin
of 84.7%. We continue to see improving efficiency in customer service and expect to see similar adjusted
gross margins for the remainder of the year.

Adjusted total administrative expenses were $106 million for the second quarter as compared to $85.9
million in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of
2020 was $52.3 million or 28.8% of revenues, up from 23.1% in the prior year quarter. We are seeing
very positive results from our ad campaigns and marketing efforts. And as the second quarter progressed,
we made the deliberate decision to further increase our advertising spend.

As long as we continue to see positive results from these investments, we intend to continue to be
aggressive in this area to drive market share gains. We expect Q3 sales and marketing expense to be
approximately $8 million to $10 million higher than Q2 on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. We are
maximizing our opportunity to capture market share by spending more on advertising.

Adjusted R&D expense was $18.8 million in the second quarter of 2020 or 10.3% of total revenues.
Adjusted total R&D costs, including the capitalized portion, were $27.7 million in the second quarter 2020
compared to $22.3 million in the prior year period. We have a very ambitious product innovation road
map, which is a key driver of our success. And we will continue to expand our R&D team with high-quality
talent.

Adjusted EBITDA was $61.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 or 33.7% of total revenues compared to
$69.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 or 41% of total revenues. We were able to partially offset the
loss of high-margin revenue with reduced costs from lower travel expenses, but the biggest driver of the
year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin decline was our deliberate increase in advertising.

Our GAAP net income for the second quarter was $28.6 million or $0.49 per diluted share based on
approximately 58 million shares, versus $48.8 million or $0.83 per diluted share based on approximately
58 million shares in the prior year period.

For Q3 and Q4, we expect our effective income tax rate to be approximately 30% and our full year
effective income tax rate to be approximately 24% to 25%.

Noncash stock-based compensation was $21.2 million in the second quarter. And we expect noncash
stock-based compensation for the third quarter of 2020 to be approximately $20 million. For the full year,
we anticipate noncash stock-based compensation will be approximately $75 million.

Non-GAAP net income for the same quarter of 2020 was $35.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share
based on approximately 58 million shares, versus $43.7 million or $0.75 per diluted share based on
approximately 58 million shares in the prior year period. We anticipate fully diluted shares outstanding will
be approximately 58 million shares in the third quarter of 2020.

From the time we increased our buyback on March 12, 2020, and through the end of the second quarter,
we repurchased over 330,000 shares, including over 240,000 shares purchased in the open market. As of
June 30, 2020, Paycom has repurchased over 4 million shares since 2016, with $175 million remaining in
our buyback program.

PAYCOM SOFTWARE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $114 million
and total debt of $32 million. Cash from operations was $25.5 million for the second quarter. The average
daily balance of funds held for clients was approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2020.

Now let me turn to our guidance. With more clarity about headcount trends in our client base resulting
from the pandemic, we believe our current client revenue has become more predictable, and we are
now providing Q3 guidance based on what we can see as of today. For the third quarter of 2020, we
expect total revenues in the range of $191 million to $193 million, representing a growth rate over the
comparable prior year period of approximately 10% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted
EBITDA for the third quarter in the range of $56 million to $58 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA
margin of approximately 30% at the midpoint of the range.

Our focus continues to be on mitigating the impact of the pandemic on our business by providing world-
class service to our clients, rapidly developing new technologies, and increasing the number of new clients
added to our platform. We have a strong balance sheet, a highly profitable recurring business model and
what we believe is the strongest value proposition in our industry. We are committed to taking advantage
of our financial position to drive long-term market share gains.
With that, we will open the line for questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.

Raimo Lenschow
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Can you -- I think the biggest question we were all going to get is like around the increase in sales and in
the advertisement spending or on sales and marketing. Can you talk a little bit about your thinking there?
Like why now? Like obviously the level is kind of a lot higher than what you've seen before. Are you seeing
like good results, good returns on that one, Is it like if I listen to ADP, they seem to be hurting a lot more,
so is this a good opportunity? Just talk me around your thinking there and then how you measure success.

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Sure. So on the last call, Raimo, end of April, I discussed how our numbers were back to pre-COVID
numbers from booked sales. I've since on this call said that our second quarter new client revenue
numbers, and these are sales -- new sales that we go out and achieve, that we actually just completed our
best quarter. Second quarter was the best quarter we've ever had from a new business sales perspective.
To follow up on that, July has been -- this July that we just finished up on today, has been the best month
we've ever had from a new business sales perspective.

And so we're paying for that. Obviously, those leads I mentioned, that leads are up 3x demo leads. These
are people that hit our website and request a demo. We've always had leads where someone might
download a brochure or download a white paper or come to a webinar. But these are leads where people
are genuinely interested and they want a product demonstration. And so about 90% of those turn into
appointments. And so we have a lot more appointments than we've had in the past, and we're achieving
greater sales.

Of course, we're spending to do that. Our advertising spend in the second quarter was much more than
we had spent in the past, and it's working. And I've been saying this: as long as advertising is working,
we'll continue to do it. We haven't made any purchases a month or 2 or 3 months out. And so our
commitments are week-to-week type of commitment on advertising, but it's having -- we're having great
success with it as I'm sure you, Raimo, and everybody else is seeing the ads on TV and online.

And another point to make is we're not just advertising the Paycom brand, we're advertising a new way
to use this type of technology. It makes no sense that HR inputs this type of data. All businesses have
deployed technology as we've moved toward a -- moved more towards an autonomous workforce. I think
we're somewhat in the rise of the autonomous worker. And it only makes sense that they would have
technology in which both they win and the client. And so we've been aggressive with it, but it is yielding
results from us on the sales side, which will continue to fold in and become current client revenue.

Raimo Lenschow
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. Perfect. Okay. That's really helpful. And then on -- you talked about the $2 million per week that,
like, you're losing because of unemployment and the unemployment situation. And you talked about the
stabilization since its peak in April. Are we still kind of thinking about like the math you laid out in Q1? Or
how do I think about that $2 million per week number now as unemployment rates are coming down? Is
there kind of a new way to think about it? Or any help there in terms of like what to do with that?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

PAYCOM SOFTWARE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Yes. I mean the number was in between -- I mean it was between $1.95 million and $2 million that
we're seeing if we have maxed out toward the end of April and it stayed consistent. I understand that
unemployment has fluctuated, but the impact on our numbers stayed consistent. Maybe our clients
took the hit in the beginning. But I did want to make a point on -- and what you're talking about, as I
mentioned that directionally in the last call, I said directionally it would be unreasonable to think that
we wouldn't be impacted by unemployment. Because I did believe and do believe that we're an accurate
sampling size, and so we should somewhat follow that. We now know that while we were directionally
accurate, we now know the exact number that it is.

And just to bring up, the numbers that are commonly reported for the unemployment claims via media,
government, what have you, it's basically calculated 2 ways. The first source is the unemployment
insurance data, and this comes from a weekly compilation of -- that the DOL receives directly from
unemployment agencies. You have both initial claims and continuing claims.

It's -- a point to make is that initial claims peaked in the second quarter, early second quarter, they were
5 million and 6 million. You had a couple of weeks there where initial claims were 5 million and 6 million.
Last week, initial claims were 1.4 million. The week before that, initial claims were 1.4 million. And they've
started to stabilize about at that level over July.

An important point to make though is pre-COVID, they were stabilized at an average of about 200,000
claims a week. And so that's one calculation, not as reliable for unemployment.

A second calculation that's used by the U.S. Department of Labor is the current population survey. And
that's where you get the 14.7% unemployment number for April and the 13.3% unemployment number
for May and the 11.1% unemployment number for June. And how they get -- how this data is derived
from actual interviews of 60,000 households in the U.S., about 110,000 people.

And so while we were directionally accurate, and while the impact of Paycom's current client revenue has
been similar to the increase in unemployment numbers, we now know the exact impact it had on Paycom.
We peaked towards the end of April, we stabilized. So while we can't call out improvement in the impact
unemployment is having on current client revenue, we can state that the situation hasn't gotten worse
and we've seen stabilization. Like I said, I'd like to think our clients took the hits early, so we'll have to see
from there.

But lastly, I did want to make this point. I mean I'm not going to try to be the drugstore economist as
it relates to unemployment. Our goal is to give directional guidance. And now that we're giving actual
guidance, I don't feel like it's necessary for us to tie to the different methods of calculating unemployment,
whether it be the initial claims, which are still elevated based on pre-COVID, or the sampling survey of
60,000 households. So we've given that number, and we have not seen that number move to be worse or
better since the end of April.

Operator

Your next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies.

Samad Saleem Samana
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

As always, appreciate all the color you just gave. Maybe if I could just ask a follow-up on the new
bookings side. If I think about sales and marketing dollars, it's up about 33% in dollar terms year-over-
year. How should we think about maybe framing the magnitude of that bookings growth? Just because
you spent the most you ever have in 2Q as well. So I'm just trying to understand maybe how to think
about what new bookings growth looks like either year-over-year or versus pre-COVID levels as a point of
comparison. Then I have a couple of follow-ups.

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

PAYCOM SOFTWARE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

Well, I mean the bookings were up meaningfully and significantly from Q2 of last year. I will say that Q2
this year was our largest booking quarter ever, and Q2 is not typically the largest booking quarter. And
then to add on to that, July has been the largest bookings month we've ever had. So while we continue to
face the current client revenue headwind that's impacting us through the unemployment, we mentioned
that's approximately $2 million. And then you layer in the $350,000 a week in unemployment. We're
hopeful to establish a floor and a new base for growth. And so we've been very focused on that.

I do fully expect that as we sell just as in the past, we spend it, we sell it. As it folds into the revenue side,
our margins continue to improve. I actually still feel good about us being able to continue to focus on and
hopefully achieve at least a rule of 50 this year, which we would expect to improve next year. And so we
don't want to be penny wise and pound foolish when it comes to the opportunity that we have in front of
us. And the spend is working. We're not going to be wasteful with it, but it's working.

And if you take $90 million out of a quarter for both revenue and -- as well as for the interest income,
there's -- our margins are quite high at an 85%-ish. And so you've got the $75 million or so out there in
margin that we've also potentially lost as well.

And so we believe the advertise -- we know the advertising is working. And as long as it continues to
work, we're going to continue to set ourselves up for the subsequent quarters. Because like I said, we
have not yet seen, or the impact -- the negative impact to our numbers get worse or better. And so like I
said, I mean we're going to continue to focus on new business sales.

And look, it took a pandemic to slow and impact our current client revenue, but not even a pandemic could
stop our new business sales because they're accelerating. So -- and that has to do with the advertising
spend in part. The other part has to do with the value proposition.

Craig E. Boelte
CFO, Treasurer & Corporate Secretary

Yes, Samad, that's $30 million a quarter. $90 million would be the 3 quarters this year.

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Right, $90 million for the 3 quarters, sorry.

Samad Saleem Samana
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great, very helpful. And then maybe if I could just -- in reading the press release, the commentary
around the client base still increasing the number of clients, it sounds like maybe churn -- or putting aside
difference, maybe unit retention was better than expected, or maybe better than what we might have
expected, given how severe the pandemic was. Maybe you could just comment on client unit retention
or the number of customers, and how that trended through the quarter versus just the pace for control
change?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Yes. We're not going to give exact retention numbers because obviously, we get those at the end of the
year. But I mean I will follow up on the same thing that I said last time. We're not really seeing units go
away. We are seeing clients that may have had 500 employees, now have 60.

But we're not seeing unit losses. We do have a few clients that may be on pause, and we're filing some 0
returns for them. Those are going to be your smaller clients that may not have payrolls to run, but they do
still have to file taxes. And so we can file 0 returns for them, so they're still active. So all that's to say is
we're not seeing unit attrition.

Your next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Chad and Craig, wondering if you can talk a little bit about any sort of differences in terms of the types
of clients that you're seeing that are being driven by the advertising? Are they smaller, larger? How many
modules are they typically taking? How do they compare to your established client base?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Same. They compare the same. I will say that we did sell our 2 largest accounts during this quarter just
anecdotally. But they've been the same. We're getting more usage in the upfront out of them as we are
now at 100% commitment to employee usage. We now are getting that on all clients as they start. So we
are seeing people's approach to conversion to be more in the effort to where employees would take a full
usage strategy. So we're seeing that. But as far as the types of clients that we're seeing, usual suspects
for us.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Any sort of change in terms of regional composition? Are you seeing more from areas that you haven't
typically been in, that are basically being bought in by the national advertising? Or how would you
characterize that?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

No. I mean our -- where we have our best reps is where we're going to sell the most. And so it doesn't
really matter what state or your location they're in. That's what we're going to do the best. And our leads
have continued to come from all over. We do have leads that come from out of territory, and those would
be places where we don't have specific coverage. But we've been handling them the way we always did.
Now before, we would fly out and see if someone had over 100 employees in North Dakota. Today, we're
doing it from the chair in our home office. And so -- but we're still approaching out-of-territory sales as
well.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then how should we think about the marketing spend and "Advertising is for wimps,"
I heard a really smart guy say that at one time. The -- if the advertising spend, if it keeps working the
way it is, I mean the fall selling season hasn't even really kicked off. Should we think about potentially the
spend going up even further as we go into next year and the following year, given that your market share
still leaves lots of room for increase?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Well, I mean you can get to a point of diminishing returns on advertising spend. You necessarily don't buy
double digital and get double. And so you have to manage that. As we've identified different touch points
of opportunities and advertising for a client through either initial or retargeting efforts, then that gives you
an opportunity to spend incrementally on that. But you can still waste advertising dollars. And so we take
a strategy that -- where we look at it week by week. I mean we're managing this on a weekly basis, and
we turn up and down the dials in areas where it makes sense for us to do that.

So our markets, our market, we are spending the advertising dollars. We are having success. But it's
hard for me to say exactly where that would go, other than to say that we have an elevated advertising
spend now. We are achieving a commensurate result for that. And we would look to do more of that in the
future, again without wasting ad dollars in areas that aren't going to produce results.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Historically, July, how does it typically rank relative to -- like what percentage of the typical best seasonal
months would July be?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

I think you can have different months that are better than others. As you know, Mark, even though we
may not have said it, I said this, I believe our industry and I know almost every one of our competitors
will tell you selling season's typically September through December as people come back from their
vacations and what have you. So I think it's a little more difficult to compare with last year where
potentially you had some people that may have been on vacation and getting back -- getting ready to get
the kids into school and that type of thing. You don't have those distractions as much right now.

And so I'm not saying July was our best July ever. I'm saying July was the best month we've ever had for
sales ever regardless of month in a year. And so -- but anyway, hopefully that answers the question.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

I appreciate it. That's [ like ], I'm saying if July was the best month ever, and it's not even the key selling
season, that should portend well for September through December.

What's the average float balance, what sort of effect yield are you getting on that now, Craig?

Craig E. Boelte
CFO, Treasurer & Corporate Secretary

Yes. We haven't disclosed the yield on our float balance. But we mentioned that 150 basis point cut in
March had about a $4.5 million per quarter impact on us. We have some that's layered out. We probably --
we may not layer out as much as some of our competitors on that. We're extremely -- we're conservative
on the way we're investing those funds. But as our renewing, obviously the rates are pretty low on those
funds.

Steven Chang
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

This is Steven Chang coming on for Brad. I just have one quick question calendar-wise. I believe that you
mentioned in first quarter that, that quarter had one less Wednesday than normal. Am I correct to assume
that the September quarter will have an extra Wednesday this year versus a year ago?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

That is correct. The quarter beginning -- yes, the quarter ending in September will have one extra
Wednesday. And so I think it happened in 2015 last time. It's happened now in 2020 where Q1 had 12

processing Wednesdays and Q3 has 14. And the point that we made in first quarter when we talked about
this is that a Wednesday has roughly half of the week's revenue billing.

Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Crédit Suisse.

Brad Alan Zelnick
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I got a couple of questions. Maybe just for starters. Chad, I've always been very impressed by your go
to market, your very disciplined approach to opening in maturing offices in geographies where you see
opportunity. But given the success you're having with virtual sales now, does it change your long-term
thinking about your go to market?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Not yet. I mean we're going to go where prospects are buying and how they buy. If prospects continue
to buy online, which -- I mean I think it's a pretty good model. It removes all distractions. And we're
watching deals that normally, you'd have had a meeting this week and a meeting 2 weeks from now and
a meeting 2 weeks from then. I mean we're seeing in some deals, you have a meeting on Tuesday, a
meeting on Thursday and a meeting the following Monday. So I think as you remove the distractions out of
the way, I think even buyers are able to focus more on functionality as well and product replacement.

So not yet, but we're looking at it. We're definitely gaining some efficiencies within our sales process
throughout management leadership, better development with salespeople because we're obviously on
a lot more calls with them than what we were able to be physically in person. So -- as well as sales
achievements continue to go up.

So I like the environment we're in. Could have done without the whole impact to our current client
recurring revenue. But we like this type of sales environment that we're going through right now. But
the fact is that the clients return back to having people in their office to buy this type of technology, then
we're going to be in the office with them.

Brad Alan Zelnick
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

It makes perfect sense, and maybe if I could just follow-up with one on pricing. You've now got the
government's PPP program that's expired. Are customers asking for concessions when we think about
PEPM on a like-for-like basis? How is that trending?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Yes. So we have a fair pricing model. You only pay for the employees that you pay. So if you have active
employees within our system and you're not paying them, we're not charging you for them. So that
company that had 500 employees, that may now have 60 employees, we're only charging you for those
60 employees as you pay them. So it's a fair model. Does that mean we haven't had a client here or there
that may have asked for that? I'm sure we have. But our model is a fair model in that you pay for who you
pay.

Brad Alan Zelnick
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Excellent. And congrats to you on all the success in generating new business in the environment.

Daniel William Jester
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. Just first on the product side. I think you briefly mentioned the Manager on-the-Go update. It's
been out 6 months now. Can you just talk about sort of adoption? And maybe more generally as you think
about sort of the product, are there any big themes you're looking about in terms of sort of evolving and
rolling out new features that have come across through client conversations in the last couple of months?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Yes. We've had a product road map for a while now, and you got to do first things first. And so for us, it
was first getting employees to interact with the database. We've done a good job on that, but we can do
better. And again, I don't think there should ever be one change that the employee didn't make on their
own. Because anytime someone else does it for them, it's duplicative. No HR department's reading an
employee's mind.

And so that said, there are some things obviously an HR person has to do that an employee is not privy
to be able to do themselves. So you have that, we came up with the app. Now we've moved into Manager
on-the-Go. And the good thing about Manager on-the-Go is it's very similar to the app. It's within the
same technology, and it keeps the data flow moving: time card approvals, performance reviews, time-off
approvals and what have you. And so it allows us to get to further automation as we move along.

And so our goal right now is to be making sure that people are using all the products we have. The more
use cases we have for these, the more companies that buy a full solution set because it's going to take the
full solution set to have full automation.

And so yes, we continue to be aggressive with our R&D efforts. We rolled out thousands of updates this
quarter. We're also finding efficiency throughout our R&D group from a number of hours that they are
actually producing. We assign hours to a project. Hours -- a project takes so many hours. We're producing
more hours of development in this environment as well.

And so we continue to be ambitious. And as we've laid the road map and especially as clients and their
employees use these products, it gets us even closer to other areas of innovation and automation that we
continue to move in.

Daniel William Jester
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Great. And then maybe just a little bit of a longer-term question here. Over the years, you've invested
a lot in sort of physical space, right? You've built a new campus in Texas. Last year, you made a big land
purchase right next to your affiliate in Oklahoma City. I guess given how you've been able to pivot to more
of a remote work environment, how do you think about the physical need for safety and the physical need
to invest to help you grow the business over the next year or 2?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Well, I've got -- I think we've got about 50-or-so people in -- occupying 1 million square feet right now,
so we're overbuilt for the environment that we're in right now. I think it's too early to say. I mean I do
think there is something to be said about building relationships in face-to-face environments. So do I see
a model where we're virtual? Not really, not from where I'm sitting right now. I think had we not had those
face-to-face interactions and built those relationships, working the way we are right now could have been
a little bit difficult.

But we're going to see what happens. I don't think we need to make those decisions today. But if there's
an opportunity to be more efficient, obviously that's something we'd be looking to achieve, provided that
supports the strong business continuity that -- objectives that we have today.

Your next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer.

Brian Jeffrey Schwartz
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Chad, just wanted to drill down into the record sales and try to see if anything is changing out there in the
market. What I just wanted to ask you really, I know you've been pushing the self-service messaging for
a couple of years now. You've really been evangelizing it. And I wonder if COVID-19 and the work-from-
home trend now that that's taken hold, if that is somehow accelerating the messaging around self-service
and that could be one of the drivers of the bookings momentum.

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Yes. Absolutely. I mean we've been running these ads for a while. I do believe people are getting it. Also,
people are having a lot of success with usage. So as employees leave one company and go to another,
we're getting leads that way. Or even people that use the Paycom solution as an administrator whether
they're in HR, payroll, benefits administration, procurement, performance, whatever they're in, they leave
one company, go to another, they're bringing in an easier-to-use solution whereby the client wins. So
absolutely a differentiated product is what's driving our sales results, but advertising, the differentiation is
getting us those at-bats. And so we've been focused on that.

Brian Jeffrey Schwartz
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

And then the one follow-up I had for either you or Craig was just trying to get, if possible, any more color
in terms of what that growth is on the bookings. Is there anything that maybe you can help us, maybe
even share what the bookings growth was last year in this quarter since we know it's above that? Or
maybe what your best month was in the company's history since we know July would be above that,
without necessarily giving the exact rate?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Yes. I mean we haven't disclosed that, and that's kind of a rabbit hole we go down that we just continue to
go down once we do. It is a fact that our Q2 bookings of this year was the highest booking quarter we've
ever had. We've had great booking quarters before. This is the highest we've ever had.

And then it's also a fact that July, the month we're in right now, is the highest month we've ever had,
which would tell you that our July month was better than any month we had in Q2, and Q2 was our largest
new business quarter.

So we just finished our largest month after having just finished our largest quarter. So we'll see what
happens the rest of Q3, but we've kept momentum ever since I shut us down for 2 weeks end of March.
My mistake cost us about 50% of booked sales revenue for those 2 weeks. We got back to about 80%
of where we were the first week of April. We got right back to where we were on pace toward the end of
April.

And then as you've heard during this, that accelerated throughout the rest of the quarter, making it the
largest quarter we've ever had for new business bookings. And then now we've just followed that up with
our largest month. And we believe that right now, at least from what we can see and as we sit here today,
our -- the impact of our current client revenue has stabilized, and that's why we've returned to guidance
for Q3.

This is Robert Simmons on for Alex. So I believe you've opened one new sales office in the last 2-plus
years. Given the usual ramp time for new office, will this now be a good opportunistic time to open a few
new ones? Or alternately -- alternatively, are you expanding your team sizes?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Yes. We haven't necessarily expanded team sizes. Now we did talk about how we've added inside sales
teams. We started adding those. We had one that we really put together through last year and then
continued to add additional teams to that. Right now, everybody is an inside sales rep on an inside sales
team. It's just our inside sales, by definition, focuses on below-50-employee companies and our outside
sales group, which again is working inside, focuses on above 50 employees.

But we're just having great success with performance. I think that the amount that any one rep sells is
continuing to increase. And it has been. I mean this isn't a phenomenon that just happened right now.
Our top reps have continued to increase the amount that one rep can sell. And so it's not that we've hired
a bunch of extra reps, it's that we're having very strong performance amongst our sales rep group, with
some moderate increases in inside sales teams as we fill them out.

Robert Edward Simmons
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. Great. And then can you size the impact of lower [ unemployment ] levels on 2Q revenue? Can we
take that $2 million and multiply it by 13? Or is that too simple?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Roughly, it will be -- yes, it will be $2 million multiplied by 13 for the quarter.

Craig E. Boelte
CFO, Treasurer & Corporate Secretary

Yes, plus the impact on the interest.

Chad R. Richison

think...

Joshua Christopher Reilly

This is Josh on for Ryan. What assumptions are you baking in the Q3 guidance for improvement in
employment trends versus new customer growth? Do you expect that $2 million per week to remain
steady in your assumptions? And then the benefit of the extra Wednesday, is that roughly an $8 million
benefit to the quarter with a half week of recurring revenues?

Craig E. Boelte
CFO, Treasurer & Corporate Secretary

Yes. The -- first off on the extra Wednesday, that would have been kind of the pre-COVID levels. Now
you're looking at more of a $6.5 million to $7 million range on that impact on the quarter.

In terms of the Q3 guidance, what we've seen so far as it relates to our current client base is not much
of an improvement. It kind of hit that $2 million level and has stayed there. And any improvements kind
of ending unemployment level would have minimal impact on us, unlike what obviously happened in April
where it went up so much. So we really haven't baked in any improvements, we haven't seen any so far
for the quarter.

Joshua Christopher Reilly
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Okay, great. And then just one follow-up. How should we think about your hiring plans in the back half of
the year versus pre-COVID plans earlier this year? Do you feel like this is also a time to ramp up hiring
more than you had maybe originally expected at the beginning of the year?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

I think it depends on the department. I think that you're going to see every business come out of this
more efficient. I think we all sent groups of people to work from home, and we all had groups of people
working different ways from home. And as you go through any business and you start identifying who's
doing what, there's opportunities to become more efficient across the board, which we've taken advantage
of that. So I think all businesses come out of this leaner than what they did going into it, to be honest with
you. And I think that we've seen some of that.

Now that said, just like we pulled back a little bit on getting people out there selling for those couple
of weeks, we did very similar with our recruiting and hiring opportunities. Those have kicked back up,
especially on sales, R&D side and some of the others. And so -- but we'll continue to look at that and staff
at what we need. So yes, I mean we have started to rehire again, for sure.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Arvind Ramnani with Piper Sandler.

Arvind Anil Ramnani
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Congrats on a good quarter. Just an overall question, certainly when the pandemic hit, you went into
changing how you sell your product, how you sell to your clients. Now that that's settled, 2 questions here.
What areas were you most surprised about from upside and downside perspectives? And secondly, are
there any sort of permanent changes you're looking to kind of put in place?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Yes. I mean I would say the upside perspective's obviously the sales piece. And I do think that this has,
like I said, the pandemic has exposed weaknesses and also create opportunities. I think probably every
business would like their employee to have a direct relationship with the database. Maybe they just didn't
want to have that conversation, and now it's much easier to do that.

From a surprise to the downside, I guess I'm surprised that our number -- the impact to our number got
to where it was and it stayed there consistently week to week. I would have expected some fluctuation
in it getting worse over time and then getting better over time. It seemed to have gotten really bad at
the beginning and stayed there. But I also think maybe clients took their hits early, and hopefully if that's
the case, we will see -- continue to see stabilization in the number. We have thus far. I mean we've seen

PAYCOM SOFTWARE, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  AUG 04, 2020

stabilization in the number now for almost 3 months. And unemployment, as you guys have seen, has
moved up and down.

But I will just go back to what I say. The most accurate unemployment data is derived from a random
survey of 60,000 households that have 110,000 people. So that's the most accurate number that we're all
trying to tie to, and it's difficult to tie to. You can take that number.

And then also what I said is pre-COVID, the number of initial unemployment claims was around 200,000.
I mean specifically first week in January was 212,000; second week, 207,000; the next week, 220,000;
the next week, 212,000; first week of February, 201,000 and 204,000. You get to the thing. And then
we get to the third weekend of March, it jumps to 3.3 million. The next week, it's 6.8 million. The next
week, it's 6.6 million. And then it goes until over these last, I'm going to call it 6 weeks, you've been in
between 1.35 million and 1.5 million for weekly initial unemployment claims filed. Far cry, almost 7x times
the number of initial claims filed pre-COVID, and we're still -- our numbers are continuing to be stabilized.
We're not seeing that impact.

And so we're going to separate ourselves from that comment. It was an important comment. We weren't
giving guidance. We needed to give directional, and so we did that. But now we know the direct impact
that it's going to have on our numbers.

And so like I said, we're building a new baseline here. Hopefully, it's built. And we'll see. But we're also
building the launch pad as we head forward into next year. And that's what we're focused on.

If unemployment numbers get better with our clients, then we're going to experience some growth. If
unemployment numbers get better from a survey and not with our clients, then we will not experience
organic growth of current client revenue. It's going to come from the heavy lifting of new business sales,
which we continue to achieve in great fashion right now.

Arvind Anil Ramnani
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes. That's super helpful. On the existing clients, the clients have been reducing headcount, you talked
about some level of stabilization. Are you able to help us think through what regards you all are seeing for
that return, where existing clients go back and rehire employees that either furloughed or laid off?

Chad R. Richison
Founder, President, CEO & Chairman of the Board of Directors

Yes. I mean I believe that. Some of the ones that I'd mentioned before, I mean I know we had health
clubs. We had hotels. We had -- we had some different groups that were impacted by that. Could we get
some uplift? Yes, we could. We absolutely could. Could we be negatively impacted more in areas that
haven't yet experienced a significant shutdown? I don't know. Maybe, but we're just going to have to wait
and see.

But one thing we did was we went through an analysis of what were the impacts on the current client
revenue. What were those numbers? When did they start? And what's been the movement since? And I
believe that's the most relative number to us.

And so we've seen stabilization. I'm hopeful that, that stabilization continues. We feel good about third
quarter. That's why we've gone ahead and returned to guidance here in the third quarter. And then
we'll see what happens subsequent to that. But thus far for the last 3 months, our numbers have been
stabilized as far as the negative impact on our current clients' unemployment trends.
