Presentation

Andrea Susan James
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy

Great. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Axon's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Webinar. I'm Andrea
James, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. This is actually our fourth
quarterly earnings over Zoom, so it's great to see faces again. Today, we have Axon's CEO, Rick Smith;
President, Luke Larson; CFO, Jawad Ahsan; Chief Revenue Officer, Josh Isner; and Chief Product Officer,
Jeff Kunins.

First we're going to give prepared remarks, and then we'll bring all of our analysts up into gallery view for
Q&A. I hope you've all had a chance to read our shareholder letter, which was released after the market
closed. You can find it at investor.axon.com. Our remarks today are meant to build upon the information
in that robust letter. If for some reason, we lose Internet or Zoom connectivity, we'll make every effort to
post a copy of our prepared remarks to investor.axon.com.

During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Any forward-
looking statements made today are pursuant to and within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These comments are based on our predictions and
expectations as of today, and are not guarantees of future performance. All forward-looking statements
are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks
are discussed further in our SEC filings.

Finally, we really encourage you all to look at our updated ESG and corporate social responsibility report,
which we published today in conjunction with our earnings. We are increasingly conscious of our social
and corporate responsibility as our company and our shareholder base grows, and we're pleased to share
this comprehensive report with you. Angel Ambrosio, whom you're familiar with on this call, is our Senior
Manager of Investor Relations and ESG. And we welcome you to reach out to us on this topic, if that's
interesting to you.

Okay. Go ahead, Rick.

Patrick W. Smith
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Thanks, Andrea.

Hi, everybody. I want to start by talking about 2020. The conventional narrative is that 2020 was a terrible
year. I'd like to offer a different perspective. Challenging times bring out the best in humanity. These are
the times that inspire us to rise up, to overcome, to stretch ourselves. The hardest times become our
finest hours. If we choose to focus on the negative, there was plenty to see in 2020. But if we look harder,
we can see so many signs of hope and progress.

Supercharged by a global plague, nations sprung into the kind of arms race we should want to see,
competing ferociously to cure a pandemic. And we all know the result, multiple vaccines developed 10x
faster than ever before. We adapted to a world where travel was simply off the table. So we virtualized
ourselves, and we learned to Zoom around the world for business. And we got to see our kids for dinner
every night. My customer engagement has jumped more than tenfold as customers are now open to video
conferencing. And we've enjoyed seeing you, our analysts and our investor community, face-to-face in our
new quarterly conference Zoom calls.

I don't mean to minimize the pain we all experienced in 2020, I understand and I shared it. My mother
passed away days before Christmas after contracting COVID. But even in that sorrow came progress as we
came together and we healed some fractured relationships within our own family. I would not have chosen
for 2020 to turn out as it did, but as we've said before, we don't get to choose what the world throws at
us, but we can choose how we respond.

AXON ENTERPRISE, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

The urgency resulting from the intense social strife of 2020 is accelerating the world's readiness to move
beyond bullets to a world where killing each other is no longer something we simply accept as some
immutable facet of human society. It has supercharged our energy as we redouble our efforts to deliver
TASER energy weapons that will outperform a traditional side arm before this decade is out. And our
customers are embracing this goal. They have told us that the bar will be very high but I'm confident our
team will deliver.

2020 was also a year where Axon delivered incredible value to our customers and the communities they
serve. As you can see -- you can see it in our results. We knew that adversity would present opportunities
for those individuals and those organizations that are nimble and adaptable, just as ice ages created
breakout opportunities for adaptable species to explosively grow in their aftermath.

In the weeks following the arrival of COVID to North America, we transformed our offices into adjunct
manufacturing spaces, allowing us to spread out, create social distance and continue to deliver exceptional
results that far exceeded our most optimistic expectations. We didn't just deliver on our operational goals,
we significantly outperformed them.

I'm personally humbled by our team's ability to deliver exceptional results in a year filled with so much
turmoil and adversity. We exceeded our goals and exited 2020 better positioned than we've ever been
before from an operational, strategic and financial perspective. Here's a few highlights.

We inked our first 2 programs of record with the federal government, including a $13 million U.S. Customs
and Border Protection order for body cameras and digital evidence management. In the fourth quarter,
we signed our largest TASER contract in company history, a $20 million order for TASER 7 from an
international customer, eclipsing our record $15.5 million TASER order from the Department of Homeland
Security in the prior quarter.

In 2020, we passed $1 billion in total bookings, with the majority of that coming from our core market
of state and local public safety. In 2020, we also delivered the largest single-contract deal in company
history, a $46 million officer safety plan with one of our major city customers. On the product side, we
launched Auto-Transcribe, deployed customers on both Respond and in Records, debuted unique new
capabilities like Priority-ranked Video Audit, and shipped countless cloud software and device firmware
improvements.

At Axon, we are continuing to look forward. We had a recent executive planning session where we asked
ourselves, where do we want to be at the end of this decade? And our answer was simple. Our vision is to
be globally synonymous with our mission of protecting life by building the world's largest and most trusted
network of safety devices and services. What an amazing opportunity to be part of such a talented team
with such an aspirational mission.

I'd like to conclude by telling you what I'm hearing from our customers today. They see us as a key
partner to transforming public safety. We hear stories daily about customers using our products to save
lives and to protect communities. Our Net Promoter Scores are hitting new highs. And our customers are
actively and enthusiastically supporting our mission to make the bullet obsolete, so that officers will no
longer have to make the most terrible of choices. We know that we're welcoming a lot of new shareholders
onto our growth journey. So thank you for joining us, for taking an interest.

And with that, I'd like to turn over the call to our President, Luke Larson.

Luke S. Larson
President

Thanks, Rick.

As 2020 showed us, a lot that happens in this world is outside of our control. Against that backdrop, Axon
employees really showed up and gave their best in the areas that mattered the most. I want to give an
emphatic thanks to all of our employees. Thank you.

AXON ENTERPRISE, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

At Axon, we've built an amazing team, and that talent is a huge asset and competitive advantage
that doesn't show up on the balance sheet. Our team is laser focused on a clear mission, inspired by
our purpose and leaning in with an owner's mindset with a maniacal focus on delivering value for our
customers.

In 2020, we focused on our commitment to the mission, to our customers and to caring for the health
and safety of our employees. In 2020, Axon was able to outperform in a difficult year because we've built
a phenomenal team. Looking to the future, our company has the talent, infrastructure and capabilities
to manage challenging environments and thrive. The company earned this position over 3 decades by
taking risks, making bold decisions, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development,
countless hours of engineering, tens of thousands of hours of customer meetings and most importantly,
maintaining an unfaltering commitment to our mission.

As we look to 2021, and we have 4 key objectives: one, grow the core; two, scale new products; three,
unlock new markets; and four, drive efficiency to fuel growth. We're also taking care of the amazing team
that we've built. Our employees' health and growth remains a top priority. We recently added Ginger, a
mental health app, providing 24/7 support to our employees as well as rolled out LinkedIn Learning to the
entire company. In 2021, we will continue to look for ways to support our working parents and caregivers.
In 2021, and we'll continue to invest in our people, products and sales channels, helping individuals level
up, aim higher and push harder to make our mission a reality.

I'll close out by talking about one of the areas of added investment, which allows us to go after a $2
billion total addressable market, and that is our investment in virtual reality training. As a former military
officer, I saw how the DOD's near-unlimited budget can create amazing training, like mock towns filled
with thousands of Arabic-speaking actors, huge multi-group trainings as well as unmatched simulator
training that pilots used for flight training. In law enforcement, though, they don't have the luxury of
these enormous budgets or the benefit of having the majority of their time available to train. With virtual
reality, we can leverage the best-in-class instructors and training to create scenarios that can be used
across hundreds of thousands of officers bringing the cost down to a very economical price that can
democratize training. And Axon is poised to be a leader in creating this new category, just like we've done
with the TASER devices, our Axon Body cameras, Digital -- our Digital Evidence Management System,
Evidence.com, and we're going to do it again with virtual reality training.

In 2021, we intend to transform how agencies train our officers by addressing the inefficiencies around
the classroom, role-playing and simulator training. And by leveraging VR, we can address their 2 biggest
issues, budget and time. We'll accomplish this through 3 avenues: First, we have an exciting product
launch that we can't say more on but it is coming soon; second, we intend to regularly release new
training modules; and third, we are doubling down on our Community Engagement Training curriculum.
We're seeing encouraging signs on demand for this product, and we're excited about where it can go.

Earlier, I talked about the amazing team and culture we've built at Axon. Before I hand it over to our CFO,
Jawad Ahsan, if you want to learn more about that culture, I recommend you check out his book, What
They Didn't Tell Me. You can get it on Amazon.

So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO, Jawad Ahsan.

Jawad A. Ahsan
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Luke.

I want to start by talking about the number 28. I'm not referring to the number of days in this month, but
rather 3 important milestones we hit as a company this quarter. We delivered 28% growth on revenue
over 2019, 28% compound annual growth in revenue over the last 5 years, and we finished the year with
28% in adjusted EBITDA margins.

Now before I dive deeper into these, I want to talk about something else, the perception of our 2 business
segments. We've discussed with you at great length, the investments we've been making in our pivot to
a tech-enabled solutions company. The perception of our Software and Sensors segment is best described

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

6

AXON ENTERPRISE, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

by letting the numbers speak for themselves. Year-over-year, total revenues in this segment grew 26%,
and our ARR grew 37%.

When I joined Axon in 2017 and our stock price was at $22, many investors told me that they viewed our
stock as appropriately valuing our TASER device business with a free option on a high-growth software
business. I think it's safe to say that we're now seeing some value in our stock price for our Software
business. But what about that TASER devices segment, the one that's been around since 1993? Was
there maybe a perception that its best days are behind it? If so, we shattered that perception with our
2020 results. Our TASER Weapons segment grew revenues 30% year-over-year, outpacing even our fast-
growing Software and Sensors segment. We're very proud of the TASER energy devices that we've built
and believe that there's still a large base of untapped customers who have yet to adopt.

So the 28% revenue growth over 2019 was really fueled by strength across the board in body-worn
cameras, in software and especially in TASER devices. We feel that this validates our strategy to invest
aggressively in both R&D and channel expansion. R&D to stay ahead of the innovation curve in all of our
product segments and channel investments that will unlock new markets and new geographies. We're
going to run this play again in 2021.

When we look back over the past 5 years and the 28% CAGR on revenue, that's also the result of
investments we've been making along similar lines. As we look ahead to the next 5 years, we're very
excited by the next wave of new products and technologies that are going to become an important part
of our growth story in their own right. Technologies like VR, which Luke just talked about earlier, and we
feel can have a transformative impact on the critical area of training for law enforcement. Technologies
like Axon Respond and our livestreaming platform. What's particularly exciting with this one is the interest
we're seeing outside of our core law enforcement market.

For example, coronavirus and the vaccine rollout is top of mind for communities all over the world.
A municipal security unit in Chile has been trialing Axon Respond livestreaming to ensure the quality
and security of the supply chain and transportation process for COVID-19 vaccine distribution in their
community.

Another technology we're excited about is our new ERP and CRM. Many people across Axon are working
incredibly hard on upgrading these critical support systems and their associated processes, and they're
already driving huge efficiencies as the early modules come online. Luke also talked about the importance
of driving efficiencies to fuel growth, and we're laying the foundations today for a company that will be
able to scale to $1 billion in revenue and well beyond.

Now you might be wondering why am I choosing to highlight our new ERP along with sexier technologies
like VR and livestreaming. And I'm doing it to highlight something I can sum up in one word, discipline.
We have our sights set on some lofty goals by 2030, as Rick mentioned, but our feet are firmly planted
in the here and now. I'm so proud of the discipline we exhibit as a company on a day-to-day basis, in our
capital allocation decisions, our budgeting, our execution. This is a team that is absolutely dialed in and
ready to build on our momentum and take our company to even greater heights.
And with that, we're going to turn it over to questions.

Question and Answer

Andrea Susan James
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy

Thank you, Jawad and team. Let's take our first question from Jonathan Ho at William Blair.

Jonathan Frank Ho
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

I just wanted to start out with sort of the tremendous quarter and year that international had. Can you
maybe talk about what is driving sort of that increased demand? And is there sort of a broader mindset
shift that you're seeing with either how agencies or national police forces are starting to look at the
TASER?

Joshua M. Isner
Chief Revenue Officer

Thanks, Jonathan, for the question. Ultimately, I think it's just a lot of hard work that our team is putting
in. A few years ago, we said we were going to continue to focus on Tier 1 markets until we felt really
good about earning the right to go into Tier 2 and 3 markets. And now we're starting to see that kind of
mechanism pay off. And this was a foundational year in 2020 in some of our Tier 2 markets. We're seeing
new markets by TASERs at high volumes, and we're extremely excited for that trend to continue this year.
And so we're really focused on growing the TASER business and then earning the right to expand into
other product lines in these markets, and we're going to continue to execute day-to-day toward that end.

Jonathan Frank Ho
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Got it. And just as a follow-up, have state and local government pressures created any sort of headwinds
in terms of your pipeline of opportunities? Or is it actually the reverse where maybe this is opening up
some opportunities just given your strong value proposition?

Joshua M. Isner
Chief Revenue Officer

I don't -- I can't really offer an opinion on that, to be honest. I think it's more just -- we're focused
on covering the market as best we can, not only in state and local, but in federal and international as
well. And by doing that, certainly, we feel like we have the best products in law enforcement and public
safety, and we're going to continue to tell that story and make customers very happy and turn them into
evangelists for our company. And regardless of what pressures may or may not exist in any given year, we
think that's the long-term winning formula.

Andrea Susan James
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy

Thank you, Jonathan.

And analysts, we do -- we have you all in the queue. We added you one by one as you joined the call this
afternoon. So we've got you. No need to do the hands raise, but we appreciate the questions. Okay.

Will Power from Baird is our next question.

William Verity Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Right. Great. Yes, this is a bit of a follow-up, I guess, to the previous question in the international
comments. But just looking at TASER, obviously, just a huge quarter. Any other color you can provide
on the key underpinnings there? As you look at the upside in the quarter, what was the upside surprise,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

AXON ENTERPRISE, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

if there was? Obviously, you had one big customer that looks broad-based. More than that, is it tied to
certain geographies, certain types of local agencies versus federal? Anything else you'd call out with
respect to that TASER strength?

Joshua M. Isner
Chief Revenue Officer

Yes, sure. So I think we had some visibility into some large deals in Q4, but -- not to get too specific, but
some of the challenges in this environment are making sure we can deliver and get accepted in some
short periods of time. And we did get the order in time in Q4, and we're able to deliver it. We view that
as kind of a 50-50 proposition in early November. The team did a fantastic job executing. But behind that
one large order, there were a series of kind of midsized orders in international across all 3 geographies;
the Americas, EMEA and APAC, and I think it just speaks to the work the team is doing to really focus in
on markets that are now ready to move to more -- less-lethal solutions. And again, we believe we can
parlay that into body camera adoption and records management adoption and virtual reality adoption and
so forth over the long term.

William Verity Power
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

If I could stick a question for Luke. I know as you talked about the key 2021 objectives, you had 4 key
ones. One of them was scaling new products. Wonder if maybe if you could just update us with respect to
Records and Respond, what are you putting in place to accelerate growth there? What does that cadence
of opportunities look like as you kind of move through 2021 here?

Luke S. Larson
President

Yes. Well, we're seeing a lot of interest from our customers, specifically around the entire kind of Axon
portfolio, where we see the biggest adoption of these capabilities is in our officer safety plans that we
offer.

I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Kunins to add a little more color on the specific product details.

Jeffrey C. Kunins
Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Software

Sure. Thanks so much for the question. So on Records, we're -- we continue to be incredibly pleased with
our momentum in Records. A latest good data point is that 40 agencies have now signed or in deployment
or are live on one or more modules of Records, including more than a dozen, who've committed to full
replacement of their legacy RMS. In addition to that, within that, early momentum with major cities
specifically continues. 2 recent examples are that Atlanta actually went live on the Standards' use-of-
force module of Records in Q4. And Baltimore, which has been publicly announced before as an upcoming
full Records customer, is on track for their deployment this year. So we're incredibly excited about the
continued accelerating momentum there.

Also, as we -- you saw in the shareholder letter on Respond for Devices, we had a 7x growth in
livestreaming and other aspects of engagement of the product over the last 6 months and continue to
really see really strong adoption of all aspects of Respond for Devices across the footprint. And as Rick
talked about in the beginning, some of the key further additions we're making to the product line that
compound the value of all those pieces together that we're most excited about include Auto-Transcribe. So
now that our Auto-Transcribe unlimited package is out, it powers a whole variety of scenarios, including
not just accelerating evidence management, but also new capabilities like Priority-ranked Video Audit,
which really helps agencies use the data that's underneath their body camera video to help them with
making sure that they're compliant with policy and helping make them make their body warm camera
programs more effective than ever.

Thanks, Will, really appreciate it.

Next question from Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum.

Jeremy Scott Hamblin
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on an incredible year to the team. I wanted to come back to the international for a
second, where you clearly have a ton of momentum and I think this is probably directed towards Josh.
Just in understanding the international cycle -- sales cycle, which has typically been longer over the
years, it does seem like with the momentum that potentially there's greater urgency being seen with the
customers that you're talking to. But I wanted to get a sense on whether or not that international sales
cycle is starting to compress and if you're realizing these contracts sooner. Or this is just reaping the fruit
of a number of years of laying foundation? But it does feel like that sales cycle is compressing a little bit.

Joshua M. Isner
Chief Revenue Officer

Yes. Certainly. Thanks, Jeremy. I think it is compressing a little bit. And I think the other element we
have is we've added to our international team pretty substantially over the last 3 or 4 years. I think
it's probably started around 10 people in 2016 that were direct sellers, and we've multiplied that by
2 or 3 at least. And the result of that is we just have more activity in the pipeline quarter-to-quarter.
So that pipeline is starting to come into fruition, and there's certainly an element of the sales cycle
seems to be speeding up a little bit, but we just have way more opportunities now every quarter. And
certainly, it relieves a little bit of pressure of fewer opportunities, and we have more ways to get there
now, which feels great, and we're going to continue to focus on building that out. And we're making some
investments, again, this year, in certain markets to create even more momentum. And hopefully, we'll
continue to see that trend in the years to come.

Jeremy Scott Hamblin
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Great. And I wanted to ask -- I know you can't provide a ton of details around the new product launch.
But historically, when you've had major product launches, you take a little bit of a step back on the margin
front, investment being made both on the sales side of the equation, but obviously, also some in R&D. I
just wanted to get a sense in terms of the revenue base as a whole is significantly larger than it's been in
the past. And just to get a sense for if there is going to be some margin drag this year, can you quantify
-- can you give us a sense of the magnitude as you look at both -- what sounds like an entirely new
product launch, but also some of the other -- whether it's Records, developments or Dispatch, whatnot,
the potential drag that you might see on margins?

Jawad A. Ahsan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, I'll take this one. Jeremy, it's a good question. We are not expecting any margin drag from the new
products that we're launching. We're actually expecting some margin expansion. In 2020, we were looking
at some of the headwinds that we had on TASER. We also had some customer mix as far as international
shipments, and that's behind us. And so in this year, even with the new products we're launching, for
some of the newer ones specifically like VR, there's a little bit of a drag from a hardware perspective, but
it's so small as -- so as to be negligible. Overall, we're not expecting any drag.

Jeremy Scott Hamblin
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Great. Last one for me, real quick, on supply chain. So as you've gotten more federal contracts and
so forth, and obviously, we know how you're producing TASERs and the cameras. Has there been any
pressure to alter your supply chain? Is that something that you're considering down the road and where
you're sourcing cameras and how the cameras are coming?

AXON ENTERPRISE, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

President

We've got decades of experience producing our TASER devices where ICAR is restricted, which means
we have to manufacture in the U.S. And so we feel really, really good about that process. On the camera
side, it's something that we definitely keep an eye on. As it sits today, we still feel really, really good with
the way that we manufacture and then kind of load the final firmware on the product. And so I don't see
anything from kind of the supply chain side.

I would defer to Josh, if he's hearing anything from the customers.

Joshua M. Isner
Chief Revenue Officer

Yes. I think we're in a fantastic position, inventory and supply chain-wise. Our customers have been
delighted that we've really, at times, accelerated the speed at which we're able to deliver large deals, and
that's a huge credit to Josh Goldman and our entire operations team. They're just doing a fantastic job
supporting our customers. And this is actually, over the years, the best I've ever felt about our ability on
the supply chain and logistics side to please customers. So I'm really, really bullish going into this year in
that regard.

Jeremy Scott Hamblin
Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division

Great. Congrats and best wishes this year.

Next question from Erik Lapinski at Morgan Stanley.

Congrats on the quarter. Last month, you announced a deal with a private security company. And I guess
I'm just wondering what kind of opportunity do you think that market can represent. Are you seeing
interest from other private customers? Or is that maybe a one-off type deal that wouldn't be something
we could see again? And are there investments you could make to attack that?

Joshua M. Isner
Chief Revenue Officer

Yes. Absolutely. It's a great call out. Last year, our private security business doubled, and the only thing
that really changed was a little more focus on it. We have a team led by Mike Shore that is divided
between private security and enterprise use cases. And this year, that team is really focused on at
least doubling, hopefully, tripling that private security number again and building out our first group of
customers in non-law-enforcement use cases. So we're really excited about both of those opportunities to
expand the TAM and really find ways to generate returns on an investment of body cameras for businesses
outside of public safety.

Erik Taylor Lapinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could just kind of squeeze one on the Dispatch side. I know you
had mentioned this kind of over the last few quarters that you're building in incremental capabilities and
maybe that would be a hold off for certain customers that started adopting that. I guess just wondering
like where you are with that. Do you feel that the product is there? Is there enough of a road map for
even a larger police department to kind of see it and potentially hold off on a replacement to migrate to
you? Or I guess just -- I know it's early, but anything you can update us on there?

AXON ENTERPRISE, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

Jeffrey C. Kunins
Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Software

Sure. Thanks, Erik. It's a great question. I think first, like we said before, Dispatch and really more
broadly, this idea of Respond of a real-time operations platform is a multiyear journey. And so we're very
confident that over the next 3 to 5 years, we're going to wind up being #1 in what's traditionally called
the legacy computer-aided dispatch market, but our sites are even broader and more ambitious than that.
But as Jawad said earlier, our feet are also very firmly planted in the present. And so like right now, today,
as you know, we have one city live on our Dispatch platform, and we have multiple more that are signed
and sold in the queue for deployment over the course of this year and going forward. So we feel very good
about that pipeline.

Just like we talked about Records and really in any software category where you have an insurgent trying
to unseat legacy competitors, which, in this case, we're the insurgent, there's this journey of building
up in the right way, the capability is needed to be the right fit for each successive chunk of the market,
while adding on top of that, your unique differentiation that makes you a compelling reason to switch. And
that's just -- that has nothing to do with Axon or CAD or Records, that's just the physics of any disruptive
insurgent category like this. And we feel really good about where we're positioned and where we're going,
even though it's early.

And in the case of Dispatch, the sort of sequence or ladder there is first being great for law enforcement
only PSAPs as opposed to ones that also do fire and medical for sort of the midsized cities. And then
actually, after that, gearing up to also cover fire and medical, which we're actively working on this year.
And then ultimately, to be not only the largest cities, but the multi jurisdiction PSAPs. So we feel fantastic
about our trajectory, but it is early in that journey, but we needed to keep you apprised as we win and
deploy customers along that way.

Patrick W. Smith
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Let me jump in as well. I want to share a story. I talked to a police chief of the first agency, I believe, in
the world, certainly in the United States, that is livestreaming every call into Dispatch, video livestream.
And it was just so rewarding to have that phone call, to hear the things that we have been imagining come
to pass. And what that chief shared with me was it's just a total game changer. They found dispatchers
are actually helping new officers in real time. He told me a story where the dispatcher heard a thud that
the officer didn't, right? Because the officer is in the scene, there -- they've got total vision. Sometimes,
they're focused on their own safety. The dispatcher is sort of a dispassionate aid. Well, it turned out the
thud in that case was a gun had been dropped to -- the person in the car dropped it and tried to kick it
under the seat. The officer -- the dispatcher told the officer, "Hey, I heard something you should check."
And they discovered there was a gun, and obviously, that's a pretty important piece of information the
way that it's unfolding.

The other thing that they shared with me was that by having the dispatchers watch the call, they just have
far greater understanding than when they're just listening to a few cryptic transmissions over the radio
and they're getting real-time oversight of every incident. So you think about everything that happened
last year, and now there's discussion about, well, how did the agencies pick the right videos to have a
subsequent supervisory review? In this agency, they're reviewing every video, not by a supervisor, but by
a dispassionate dispatcher. And you can imagine if someone was saying something like, "I can't breathe,"
that could be reacted to right now where the dispatcher could say, "Hey, I need a supervisor to check this
out and see what's going on in real time," not find out weeks later that, that was happening. So it's that
sort of [ poor ] -- transformative new capability that we are uniquely able to position.

And you'll probably guess there's a little bit of a dynamic tension between me and Jeff, who keeps me
honest, where it's like, hey, we need to do the things he was talking about there, we've got to deliver
on the core functions of what they need to be a functioning system today and blend in the right amount
of these new capabilities because you can't -- you've got to kind of have both. And it's just been [ so
wonderful ] having Jeff on the team that I think he's really shepherding us through that process of how we

blend the right mix of legacy features with the right mix of new features to be transformative and effective
at displacing existing incumbents.

Jeffrey C. Kunins
Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Software

One last tiny bit just to put all that together, it's exactly that combination of why we declare Respond
and this idea of a real-time operations platform, that's the real category. Historical CAD is cute. Real-
time operations platform is skating to where the puck is going. And from a business and this insurgent
standpoint, the key is just like how with Records, an agency can adopt Standards, our use-of-force module
of reps, side-by-side with their legacy RMS, even before they might be ready to make a full migration.
Respond for Devices, what we used to call Aware, what Rick was just referring to, our livestreaming, any
PSAP in conjunction with their law enforcement agency can easily deploy Respond for Devices right in their
PSAP alongside their legacy CAD, even if they aren't ready to switch over for their full CAD. But that not
only gets them into these scenarios earlier, but it also gets them acculturated to our experience, and we
think that's ultimately an accelerator to when they're ready to consider a full migration.

Erik Taylor Lapinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. That's awesome. Thanks for sharing that example, I mean that's the point, the vision coming to life.
So congrats.

Patrick W. Smith
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Thanks, Erik.

Andrea Susan James
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy

Thank you, Erik.

Next question from Derek Soderberg at Colliers.

Derek John Soderberg
Colliers Securities LLC, Research Division

So I wanted to start with consumer TASER. It looks like that was pretty strong again this quarter. I was
wondering if you can sort of elaborate on what drove that strength again. I know there have been some
tailwinds due to the pandemic and some other things that happened in 2020. Just curious as to your
thoughts on that business as we sort of move past that a little bit. How sustainable is consumer TASER
strength? And I guess maybe longer term, if you can update us on the strategy there to penetrate this --
the nonlethal weapons market.

Jawad A. Ahsan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks for the question. Our consumer business doubled in revenues year-over-year, 2020 over
2019. And some of that early in the year was the pandemic and some of the -- just overall lift in firearm
sales, and we were certainly a beneficiary of that. We did put a new general manager of the consumer
business in place around second quarter last year, and he's really up-leveled our game. He has a
marketing background, Matt Angorn. He's got a very strong background in marketing, and he's tried to
move things for us. It actually had a very immediate effect and we've seen that momentum continue into
2021, which is how we know it's not a fluke.

We've got some pretty lofty goals for the consumer business. We've got 2 new products that we're
bringing to market by the end of this year. And longer term, our ambition is -- as a company is still
to make the bullet obsolete, and that doesn't just happen with building a better TASER device for law
enforcement. We're planning on building the -- a consumer device that also does the same thing.

AXON ENTERPRISE, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

And then I want to turn it over to Rick and let him talk a little bit about his vision as well.

Patrick W. Smith
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Yes. So we started this business back in 1993, the original TASER was already being sold to police. Our
original business model was to drop for consumer for 2 reasons. One, it is where we can actually do even
more moral good by saving lives. Police officers are involved in hundreds of lethal force incidents every
year. But private citizens shoot and kill 35,000 to 40,000 of each other every year. So we can save the
most lives if we can have impact there. And from a market scale perspective, it's frankly just a much
larger market. So even the GLOCK handgun that is ubiquitous in law enforcement has a far larger, both
dollar and unit volume they sell in the consumer market. So we're committed both for the business
reasons and for the mission and North Star reasons to see the consumer continue to grow. And I think
part of that -- I personally believe we will hit a tipping point when we can actually prove that we can
outperform a standard 9-millimeter, that, that is going to be transformative, not only in our core U.S. law
enforcement, I think every other police agency around the world. I -- and I don't want to start naming
off countries here, but pretty much any country is not going to have the same relationship with guns that
Americans do.

So let's just take Iceland as an example. If we could outperform their GLOCK handguns, all of a sudden, I
think we could become the standard weapon. And I just picked that as a totally random country. But you
go around the world, and I think the minute that we can actually say, "This could replace your firearm,"
every police force that carries a firearm is now a customer, and they're going to be under tremendous
political and moral pressure to use the better, safer thing that saves lives. I think that also opens up the
consumer market. So I think we're in the early innings.

We entered law enforcement in 1999 to prove the technology worked so we could reenter the consumer
market, and that play has still not played out yet. And I'd also like to say we moved consumer under
Jawad a couple of years ago, and he gets a lot of credit for breathing new energy in, bringing Matt Angorn
in. And this is kind of Jawad's -- one of his passion projects is helping us in the consumer space.

Derek John Soderberg
Colliers Securities LLC, Research Division

Great. And as my follow-up, Rick, last quarter, you had sort of mentioned the conversation you had, had
with a U.S. Congress person. I guess now with the new administration, new representatives, I guess I'm
curious as to how those conversations have evolved over the last quarter. Are you sort of feeling that
same sense of optimism around maybe sort of a sweeping police reform bill that includes body cams? Or
how has your sort of sense of optimism changed?

Patrick W. Smith
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Well, my sense of optimism is pretty dauntless. If anything, sometimes I need some people to make sure
I keep my feet grounded. I would say this, though. I think that the trends towards body cameras and less-
lethal weapons and all the things we're doing is really more ground up. There's certainly been some talk
about whether there's going to be a legislative action at the federal level. I don't want to guess on that.
I mean that would obviously -- could be very helpful if it happens. But we're not -- that's nowhere in our
plans. We think we are just continuing to win the hearts and minds of agencies and communities and the
end user by delivering stuff that saves their careers, saves their lives, saves them all the trauma of having
to deploy lethal force or having their integrity questioned when something controversial happens and
knowing they can defend themselves with a body camera. So I think I wouldn't say anything has changed,
positive or negative, at the political level. I think we're just continuing to see that groundswell from the
state and local, that's where these decisions really get made.

Andrea Susan James
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy

Okay. Thank you, Derek.

Our next question is from Keith Housum at Northcoast.

Keith, you're up next and you're muted. There you go.

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Sorry about that. I just want to echo guys, congratulations again on the quarter and a great year. If I can
pry or dig down a little bit deeper on the TASERs for the year, obviously, tremendous growth, how much
of that growth is coming from a -- nontraditional state and local agencies? You guys were talking about
a number of different initiatives in terms of federal and jails and corrections and the security. But if you
could kind of provide a bit of color to break out between, I guess, the old sources of revenue as well as the
new?

Joshua M. Isner
Chief Revenue Officer

Yes, absolutely. I appreciate the question, Keith. International certainly was a big driver of CEW --
weapons growth. I think we've talked about that to a large extent already. Federal also is a place where
we had a good year last year in terms of some new agencies coming on board with some of our newer
CEWs. This year, we certainly expect to see more of that in our federal business. We're really excited
about a couple of the CEW opportunities that are out there.

And then state and local with -- really hitting our stride with TASER 7. State and local bookings, it's the
market we hear every year questions about, hey, is the growth slowing down? Is it flattening out? And last
year, state and local bookings were up almost 30%. And so that was, I would say, pretty equal weighting
between body cameras and TASERs. And so I think across all segments of the market, the team is doing
just an exceptional job of making sure that we continue to grow the TASER line.

We certainly believe like every single law enforcement officer is better served carrying a TASER than not.
And until that happens, we got a lot of work to do to bring that into fruition. So that's really what we're
focused on, not only in federal or international, but also in state and local, where there's still plenty of
room to go there.

Keith Michael Housum
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Okay. Appreciate it. And I would be remiss if I didn't ask the question about the guidance. It looks like the
guidance for the full year next year is about 12% growth year-over-year. You obviously got some great
tailwinds at your back, but you're obviously [ going against some huge numbers that you're confident ]. If
I look at cartridges, I look at the consumer devices, obviously, some good tailwinds for you. So -- and you
guys have never grown only 12%, I think, at least in the recent history ever. What gives you the indication
that revenue growth is going to actually slow down so much year-over-year?

Joshua M. Isner
Chief Revenue Officer

Yes. We're certainly not done. We -- in the last couple of years, you've seen growth in the mid- to high
20s. You've also seen that those years tend to be back-end loaded. Q3 and Q4 combined are usually
significantly higher than Q1 and Q2 combined. And so as we think about it, right, it's early February, we're
certainly trying to sell far more than $760 million, and that's our goal every year is to exceed our growth
rate in the previous year. But having said that, we haven't seen the pipeline materialize for the back half
to the point where we can be a little more aggressive on our guidance. And in quarter 1, we have to be
responsible and disciplined about how we guide. And so this is something we're going to revisit every
quarter. And as that back half pipeline materializes, you'll certainly hear more about that as it's happening.
But on day 1 here, we're starting with $760 million. And like I said, though, we got -- and like you said,
we have a lot of tailwinds, and we're really focused on another great year in revenue.

AXON ENTERPRISE, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

Okay. Anybody have anything to add? Okay. So we're not seeing any slowdown, just want to make that
clear. Thank you.

Jawad A. Ahsan
Chief Financial Officer

Andrea, I actually might piggyback on that from an EBITDA standpoint for guidance, just to -- how you
should think about that, just provide some more context. So ever since I joined Axon, it's been really
important to me that we're demonstrating both growth on our top line as well as driving leverage on our
bottom line. And we've not only done exactly that over the last few years, but it's also been a central tenet
of our long-term guidance, as you know. So it's super important to us that we're continuing to invest to
stay ahead of the innovation curve, that's another sort of thing that we're trying to solve for. So every
year, we put together an operating plan or a budget that's trying to solve for those 3 things: Top line
growth, driving leverage and investing for growth. And it's actually super hard to do, but we've got a very
talented management team, and that's what we've been doing.

However, one of the dynamics, as Josh had pointed out, of our business is that our revenue profile
throughout the year is back-half weighted. And even then, it's really more concentrated in Q4 than in Q3.
So what happens is if we hit our revenue targets, our EBITDA comes in on plan, on our internal plan, and
we drive that a little bit of incremental margin expansion while still having invested in things like R&D or
the channel. But if we beat our revenue targets, especially in the fourth quarter, it's too late in the year to
reinvest that upside. So we return it to shareholders, which is exactly what you saw this past quarter. So
that's how you should be thinking about it from an EBITDA standpoint, Keith, our base plan is solving for
top line growth, incremental leverage and investing for growth. And to the extent that we exceed on the
top line, that will allow us to drive even more leverage.

Andrea Susan James
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy

Thanks, Jawad.

Okay. Last question, I believe, unless anybody has follow-ups is from Scott Berg at Needham.

Scott Randolph Berg
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. Congrats on the awesome quarter. I guess I've got a couple of questions. Jawad, just a point of
clarification, first of all, on the large TASER sales in the quarter. Were those -- was that $20 million order
all for TASER 7s, given it's international and their propensity historically to buy something other than that?
I just wanted to clarify that.

Jawad A. Ahsan
Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Josh, I want you to weigh in that, that was all TASER 7.

Joshua M. Isner
Chief Revenue Officer

Sure. It was TASER 7 and accessories associated with the cartridges, batteries, holsters and so forth.

Scott Randolph Berg
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Oh, got it. And then just as a part of that is -- were they all purchased on a subscription plan? Or were
they kind of an upfront product purchase? And I saw the mix in the quarter certainly down shifted for the
mix of TASERs on subscription.

Joshua M. Isner

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

AXON ENTERPRISE, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 25, 2021

Chief Revenue Officer

Yes. It's a great question, Scott. So for us, in Tier 1 markets as well as in the United States, we do sell
TASER 7 on subscription. But in Tier 2 markets and Tier 3 markets, we actually sell TASER 7 in a similar
bundle, but it's available for an upfront purchase. And the reason we do that is twofold. Number one,
oftentimes, there's distributors in the middle of the deal, and that complicates how the subscription would
work. In this case, there were -- there was no distributor. But part 2 is we don't have a very strong, well-
documented payment history with some of these first-time buyers for large TASER orders. And thus, to
protect the company and shareholders, we do ask to be paid upfront so that we're not recognizing revenue
ahead of getting paid more or less.

Scott Randolph Berg
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Awesome. That's great. And then my final question, I don't know if this is for yourself, Josh, or maybe
for Rick, is your livestream usage up 7x from April to December, that's a -- it's a big number. I know it's
coming off a small base because you're just starting to get those devices in people's hands at the end
of last year. But is that helping in the sales cycle yet? Are you seeing the ability to take that evidence or
to take those customer experiences and actually parlay that into new customers that are on the fence,
whether or not to buy the AB3?

Patrick W. Smith
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Josh, I'll let you take that one.

Joshua M. Isner
Chief Revenue Officer

Yes. We're really excited about where livestreaming is going. Certainly, I think over this last year, we've
seen a ton of very interesting use cases for the product, and we continue to see more and more. This
is something that as new body camera customers that are purchasing AB3, we are seeing a reasonable
number of them buy livestreaming on day 1. And then customers who have been upgraded to AB3 are
trying livestreaming early and often building it into their budget in the out quarters. And so under both
kind of use cases, we are seeing an uptick in livestreaming, and we think this is going to be central to the
value proposition across all of our products long term. So certainly, it's an encouraging sign.

Jeffrey C. Kunins
Chief Product Officer & Executive VP of Software

Scott, I think the one thing to add to that is that when people buy access to Respond for Devices,
even in addition to or instead of, if they're not ready to use livestreaming, per se, simply activating
their use of that LTE chip and the camera unlocks a bunch of other scenarios as part of our software,
including simply having accurate location for 100% of their evidence, which makes it easier to tag and
find things later for like Brady Law compliance as well as the transcription scenario I was talking about
earlier where they can now configure us -- that all of the audio from their video automatically goes up
to Evidence.com immediately upon finishing the recording so they can move even faster on some of the
evidence management pieces. So Respond for Devices, we love the livestreaming scenario, but there's so
much more that they unlock by buying that add-on.

Scott Randolph Berg
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. Congrats, again, on the wonderful quarter.

Andrea Susan James
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy

Thanks, Scott. I wanted to build upon Josh's answer on the TASER subscription question just real quick.
So those Tier 2 markets are the markets that we're a little bit newer, too, where we don't have always the

17

established payment histories that we would have in Tier 1. Tier 1 tends to be the United States, the U.K.,
Australia, Canada, those English-speaking markets. And Tier 2 are ones where we're new. And so we feel
confident that over time, we're going to be able to drive TASER subscriptions in those markets, just like we
did in the U.S. and in the U.K. But it's still early, and we also don't have the payment history to extend the
credit to do that today.

Okay. Are there any other questions? Did anyone put their hand up? No.

Okay. I think Rick we'll have you close us out.

Patrick W. Smith
Co-Founder, CEO & Director

Awesome. Thanks, Andrea, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Obviously, we're delighted to be
able to turn in results like this, and I couldn't be more proud of the team. I was just sitting back, noticing
and listening to my team field the questions, it's just been amazing to see us come together. And it's been
a challenging environment, but what a year to have turned in. I couldn't be more proud of everybody
who helped make that happen. And any of our employees and team members that are tuned in, listening,
thank you for just phenomenal effort in a crazy year.
So enough celebration on the great results in 2020, it's time to get to work on 2021. And we look forward
to talking to you all on our next quarterly update. Thanks, and stay safe.
