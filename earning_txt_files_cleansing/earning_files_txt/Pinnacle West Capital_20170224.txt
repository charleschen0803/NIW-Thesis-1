Thanks Ted and thank you all for joining us today
Pinnacle West concluded a productive 2016 with earnings in line with our expectations
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another record year
Our employees set a new companywide safety record and we continue making progress on our regulatory initiatives
Our capital execution program is on track with several noteworthy projects recently placed in the service and our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry
Jim will discuss the financial results in a moment, my comments will focus on our 2016 highlights and the year ahead
Our fleet performed very well in 2016 highlighted by Palo Verde's 25th consecutive year as the Nation's largest power producer
Total production reached 32.2 billion kilowatt hours of carbon-free electricity
In fact, the fall refueling outage for Unit-3 set a station record for the shortest outage ever and set an unclear industry record for radiological safety
Before I continue, I want to recognize Randy Edington for his significant positive impact on our company as Chief Nuclear Officer
Randy will be retiring from APS in March and I want to thank him for the great service to our company and the nuclear industry as a whole during his decade of leadership here in Arizona
Because of his skill and experience as well as his ability to develop strong leaders and sustainable processes he's left a lasting legacy of excellence at Palo Verde
In 2016, APS also achieved the safest year with the fewest reportable injuries in our history
I consider the safety of our employees the top priority, and I also believe safety metrics are good indicators of management's ability to lead an organization
These just aren’t statistics, but the result of a continued commitment from all our employees and management team to drive operational excellence
Turning to the regulatory front, we've had a busy few months with the ongoing progress of our rate review and the conclusion of the value and cost of distributed generation proceeding
I'll provide an update on these important items in a moment, but first, I want to thank Arizona Corporation Commissioner, Bob Stump whose term ended in early January this year
We appreciate his commitment to the state over his many years of public service and for driving the dialog on several complex regulatory issues
Commissioner Bob Burns, Andy Tobin and Boyd Dunn were sworn in on January 3rd to four year terms
Commission Tom Forese was also selected by his fellow commissioners as Chairman succeeding Commissioner Doug Little who lead the commission through a challenging period
I'll now provide an update on two important regulatory dockets
The value and cost of distributed generation decision and our 2016 rate review filing
On December 20, the corporation commission completed its proceeding on the value and cost of DG
The commission approved the recommendation to replace the current net metering tool [ph] with a more formula driven approach
The formula will use inputs from utility scale solar power cost and eventually transition into an avoided cost mythology
In addition, the ACC made the following determinations, first banking of energy produced by DG solar systems has been eliminated
Second, customers with DG Solar maybe considered a separate class of customers for rate making purposes, and third DG solar customers who have interconnected systems prior to the decision in APS's pending rate view will be grandfathered for a period of 20 years
This decision marks an important milestone in our commitment to modernize customer rates, while minimizing subsidies among customer classes
Although other jurisdictions have attempted to make similar changes
This was among the first of fully litigated cases in the country and was founded on our actual evidence sworn testimony and a judge's order
Moreover, the decision was embraced by a wide variety of stakeholders including local solar installers who shared our vision for creating a sustainable energy future for Arizona
I know APS's rate view is top of mind for many of you and we continue making good progress with this proceeding
Since our last call, the ACC's staff intervene filed testimony in response to our initial proposal
This provided a foundation for us to engage a meaningful settlement negotiations in January and earlier this month
We continue working with parties towards a constructive settlement proposal to be filed no later than March 17th
Last month The Administrative Law Judge revised the procedural schedule for this case, in order to provide staff with sufficient time to incorporate the recent value cost of -- excuse me, value and cost of DG decision
As a result, the time clock was extended by 33 days and the new hearing date is April 24th
2017 marks a period of unprecedented capital investment of our company as we manage more than 1.3 billion in projects and planned to spend more than 3.4 billion in capital over the next three years
Our focus continues to be modernizing the distribution grid, investing in flexible generation and advancing our customer experience
We're well positioned to be a leader in grid automation and technology integration
The EPS Solar partner program recently won the award for Renewable Integration Project of The Year at the Annual DistribuTECH Conference
Through this program our employees are studying the applications of smart inverters to integrating rooftop solar and battery storage on the distribution grid
In addition, we've recently placed into service an industry leading advanced distribution management system
Next month we'll launch a new state-of-the-art customer information system
Both systems are innovative forward thinking and bring greater value to our customers while preparing for the future
These investments drive operating efficiencies through leveraging technology on the grid which results in continued cost management and improved reliability for our customers
We also remain committed to upgrading our generation portfolio with more flexible gas generation as the Ocotillo modernization project its whole stride this year
Finally, our traditional generation and transmission business continues to drive meaningful investments as we further expand our high voltage transmission system and install environmental control technology at the Four Corners Power Plant
Recently the owners of Navajo Generating Station announced the decision to retire the plant by 2019 in which APS has a 315 megawatt stake
This generation shortfall is in addition to the existing shortfall of 3,500 megawatts by 2022 as outlined in our 2017 preliminary integrated resource plan which I described for you last quarter
Although a portion of this resource gap will be filled by Ocotillo project and our recent 565 megawatt power purchase agreement
The remainder will be procured through additional market opportunities, customer conservation and the distributed generation
In addition to our changing energy mix, we continue to embrace the growing western marketplace for wholesale power
In October we joined the Western Energy imbalanced market which produced $6 million in savings for our customers in the fourth quarter 2016 alone
We expect continued savings throughout 2017 which reduces cost for customers and improves the competitiveness of our retail rates
In summary, we delivered on our commitments in 2016 and are well positioned for 2017 in the long-term
We have a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place in place to deliver on the plan
The priorities we have for the year ahead in particular completing the rate review and executing on our capital investments and laying the foundation for APS to be a sustainable leader in an evolving industry
We remain focused on creating value through our core business while delivering on our financial and operational commitments
I’ll now turn the call over to Jim
It would be any amount at this point, so
Unidentified Analyst Okay and then just one other question on tax reform
If we had a lower tax rate and obviously that's a pass through
Would you expect that to be changed in the rate case following the tax reform or would there be any chance of that happening sooner?
Ali, this is Don here and we continue engaging with the parties in a constructive settlement discussions and in generally speaking, we believe that parties are motivated to settle
It’s really difficult to go in any detail at this point
Everything is up for negotiation
