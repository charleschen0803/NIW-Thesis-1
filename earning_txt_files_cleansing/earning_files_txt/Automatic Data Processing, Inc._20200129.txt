Presentation

Operator

Good morning. My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would
like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you
that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mr.
Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Christian Greyenbuhl
Vice President of Investor Relation

Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal
2020 Earnings Call and Webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive
Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer.

Earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials
are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will
also find the investor presentation that accompany this call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and
pretax earnings by reportable segment.

During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to
investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description and the timing of these items, along
with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure, can be found in our
earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and
as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information
on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Before I turn
the call over to Carlos, I'd like to remind you of our upcoming Innovation Day, which is scheduled for
February 10. We hope to see many of you there in person. And for those who are unable to attend, you
can find more details about how to view the event at investors.adp.com. We're looking forward to sharing
our progress on our investments in innovation as well as our vision for our HCM technology portfolio. As
always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. And with that, let me turn the
call over to Carlos.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Christian, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call.

This morning, we reported our second quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of $3.7 billion for the
quarter, up 5% reported and organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which
was slightly ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points for the quarter
and was also slightly ahead of our expectations.

Together with share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, these results helped us deliver 13%
adjusted EPS growth this quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our progress through the first half of fiscal
2020, following a difficult compare with the first half of fiscal 2019.

Moving on to operations and starting with new business bookings. This quarter, we continue to see
strength in our employer services downmarket offerings and solid progress on the sales of our Workforce
Now solutions. We were also particularly pleased to see strong double-digit bookings growth in our PEO.
With that said, we are disappointed with our 3% employer services new business bookings growth for the
quarter. This lower-than-expected growth was mainly the result of the same trends we saw in the first
quarter with our international and multinational businesses, including delayed decisions for some of our
larger multinational sales opportunities.

As we have said before, given their size, these opportunities can have an outsized impact on our quarterly
bookings metric. With this in mind, we have narrowed our full year Employer Services new business

bookings outlook and now expect 6% to 7% growth as compared to our previous guidance of 6% to 8%
growth from last year's $1.6 billion of Employer Services new business bookings. We continue to have a
solid pipeline of opportunities, and we remain confident in our ability to execute across our portfolio.

Looking at client service, we continue to see good progress with overall strength in our Net Promoter
scores and retention. As a result, we continue to expect our forecasted full year fiscal 2020 Employer
Services revenue retention to increase 10 to 20 basis points.

Now we're halfway through fiscal 2020 and at the midpoint of our 3-year targets we outlined at our June
2018 Investor Day. As we are also 6 months away from giving our fiscal 2021 guidance, and we will not be
giving any updated financial outlook at our upcoming Innovation Day, I want to take a few moments here
to look back and share my thoughts on our progress since we provided that guidance.

Let's start with new business bookings. You will recall that at our June 2018 Investor Day, we outlined
we were targeting growth for worldwide new business bookings growth of 7% to 9% through fiscal 2021.
Though we no longer regularly report a worldwide bookings figure, which, as a reminder, includes the
results of Employer Services and PEO segments together, we thought it would be helpful in that context
of a midpoint look-back to share that we have seen 8% average quarterly growth since the beginning
of fiscal 2019. We are pleased with this worldwide bookings growth, together with our improvements in
Employer Services revenue retention, and how they demonstrate the strength and stability of our business
even as we've been going through meaningful transformation as an organization with a set of broad-
based initiatives, including our service alignment initiative in fiscal years 2017 and '18, our voluntary
early retirement program in fiscal 2019 and most recently, our workforce optimization and procurement
initiatives. Meanwhile, our quarterly average consolidated revenue grew 6% reported and organic constant
currency over the past 18 months.

As we look at some of the developments that have affected our recent growth relative to our expectations,
we note that our PEO has not performed in line with our long-term expectations, driven by lower-than-
expected pass-through revenues and lower-than-planned worksite employee growth. Over the past
several quarters, we've discussed some of the factors impacting PEO revenue growth, including the
impacts from our sales incentives, recent retention unfavorability related to health care inflation and
softness in workers' compensation and state unemployment insurance rates. With the impact of these
factors, our average growth over the past 18 months in average worksite employees was 8% as compared
to our long-term expectation of 9% to 11%. And the contribution to revenue growth from pass-throughs
was 1% compared to our long-term expectation of 1% to 3%.

Despite the slight underperformance relative to our expectations, we are confident in the overall prospects
of the PEO business and continue to see healthy demand for our offerings. Our PEO platform is the leading
fully outsourced solution in the HCM market, and we combine this with best-in-class HR business partners,
which, together, helps deliver an unparalleled service experience.

Stepping back now to total revenue, we are tracking at 6% average growth through 6 quarters. We have
a solid playbook with a proven track record of driving sustained growth, and we'll continue to focus on
delivering consistent strong bookings growth and retention performance as key priorities.

And moving down the P&L, during this period, we further solidified the foundations of our business as
our associates continue to transform the way we work while also delivering innovative solutions to our
clients. These transformation efforts, along with our steady top line growth and the operating leverage
in our model, have helped deliver robust margin expansion and an average adjusted EBIT growth of
13% through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which is within the range of our fiscal 2021
target CAGR of 12.5% to 15.5%. This, together with our disciplined share buybacks and a lower adjusted
effective tax rate, has driven adjusted EPS growth of 18%, which is tracking ahead of our targeted growth
of $14.5 million to $17.5 million through fiscal 2021.

As you can tell from our guidance for fiscal 2020, we currently anticipate ending the year within our
fiscal 2021 3-year margin target range, 1 year ahead of schedule. This is no small accomplishment
given our ongoing efforts to invest in the business for the long term. Overall, I'm very pleased with our
progress to date. The journey that we embarked upon to simplify how we work, drive innovation and

AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

grow our business is a challenging one. However, and more importantly, it is also providing us with great
opportunities to demonstrate the value of our offerings to our clients as we continue to simplify the client
experience. Through these collective efforts and with the continued strength of both our R&D organization
and our worldwide sales force, we are enhancing the depth and scale of our ability to serve our clients
wherever they do business with best-in-class products and solutions that fit their needs.

Our clients, in turn, are recognizing these efforts as we continue to see improvements in both our Net
Promoter Scores as well as in our Employer Services revenue retention. It is due to the success of these
efforts that we remain committed to additional shareholder-friendly actions, such as our recent dividend
increases of nearly 45% over the past 2 years. Our track record of annual increases in our dividend puts
us in a small minority with 30 other companies in the S&P 500 that have also grown their dividend for 45
consecutive years or more.

As we look forward to the future, we remain confident that our strategy is the right one as we aim to
further strengthen our resilient business model in order to drive sustainable long-term value for our
shareholders.

Before I turn it over to Kathleen for a detailed financial review, I want you to know how proud I am of the
external recognitions that we received this quarter, which reflect the strong corporate culture on which our
business is built. As I reflect on our recent efforts, I am especially proud to see Fortune magazine again
name us to their most admired companies list for the 14th consecutive time and also ranked us #1 in our
sector. This is a remarkable achievement and a rewarding recognition for the efforts of our associates,
who are focused on providing our clients the best solutions, both for today and for the future. I am also
particularly pleased to see our efforts reflected in the Wall Street Journal's Drucker Institute list of best
managed companies, where we were one of the biggest movers, jumping 104 places into the top quartile.
These are only some of the great recognitions that we are receiving for our efforts to create opportunities
for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathleen for her commentary on our
results and the fiscal 2020 outlook.

Kathleen A. Winters
Corporate Vice President & CFO

Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone.

As Carlos mentioned, we're pleased with our continued progress in delivering growth for our shareholders,
and this quarter was no exception. This quarter's reported revenue growth of 5% and 6% organic constant
currency is slightly ahead of our expectations. And we're particularly pleased given the difficult compare to
our second quarter of fiscal 2019.

Our adjusted EBIT increased 9%, and adjusted EBIT margin was up 70 basis points compared to the
second quarter of fiscal 2019, both also slightly ahead of expectations due to the timing of our progress
across our multiple transformation initiatives. Our margin improvement continues to benefit from a
combination of cost savings related to our transformation initiatives and operating efficiencies. These
benefits were partially offset by growth in PEO zero margin benefits pass-through expenses, increased
selling and marketing expenses and amortization expense.

Similar to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we're particularly pleased with our margin performance given
the difficult compare that we faced in the first half of the year, resulting from the outsized benefits in
fiscal 2019 related to our voluntary early retirement program. Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased
by 260 basis points to 22% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease is in line with
our expectations and was mainly due to the release of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credit
carryforwards. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $1.52; and in addition to benefiting from
our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower adjusted effective tax rate was also aided by fewer
shares outstanding compared to a year ago.

Moving on to our Employer Services segment and interest on funds held for clients. Employer Services
revenues were slightly ahead of expectations and grew 4% reported and organic constant currency.
Interest income on client funds grew 7% and benefited from growth in average client fund balances of 6%

AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

to $25.1 billion. This growth in balances continues to be driven by a combination of client growth, wage
inflation and growth in our pays per control. Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in
the U.S. grew 2.2% for the second quarter. Employer Services margins increased 30 basis points in the
quarter, driven by the same factors that I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.

Our PEO segment revenues grew 9% for the quarter to $1.1 billion, and average worksite employees grew
6% to $579,000. Revenues, excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs, grew 7% to $412 million and
continue to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing. Our
value proposition in the PEO remains strong, as evidenced by our double-digit PEO new business bookings
growth this quarter.

Our mid-market sales channel continues to grow following the realignment of our sales incentives, and
we're seeing continued signs of positive traction within our downmarket referral channel. With these
factors in mind, we remain optimistic in our ability to reaccelerate the PEO in the latter part of fiscal 2020.

Margins in the PEO decreased about 30 basis points for the quarter, largely due to a difficult compare and
an increase in selling expenses resulted from our strong quarterly new business bookings growth.

Let's turn to the outlook for the full year and start with the PEO. With 6 months behind us now, and our
year-to-date average worksite employee growth and revenues tracking slightly below our expectations,
we do not expect to achieve the higher end of our previous guidance range. As such, we are narrowing
our guidance and now expect 9% to 10% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 8% growth in PEO
revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to
8% in average worksite employees.

As we also discussed last quarter, we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI costs
and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin, we continue to anticipate
margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020. As we noted in previous calls, this outlook
continues to include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustments
at ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.

Moving on, let's take a look at Employer Services. We are narrowing our guidance to 4% revenue growth
versus our prior outlook of 4% to 5%, driven by a combination of continued unfavorability in FX and
interest rates relative to our expectations coming into the year and the lower bookings growth in the
first half of fiscal 2020. We meanwhile continue to anticipate pays per control growth of about 2.5% and
Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 to 20 basis points, and we now expect Employer
Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 7%. We continue to expect our margin in the Employer
Services segment to expand by 100 to 125 basis points. We now anticipate total revenue growth of about
6% in fiscal 2020 as compared to our previous outlook of 6% to 7%.

This revenue outlook continues to assume an elevated level of FX unfavorability for fiscal 2020 relative to
our expectations at the beginning of the year. We continue to anticipate our growth in average client fund
balances to be about 4%, the average yield earned on our client fund investments to be about 2.2% and
interest income on client funds to be between $570 million to $580 million. We also continue to expect
interest income from our extended investment strategy to be $575 million to $585 million.

We continue to anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand 100 to 125 basis points. As a reminder,
this guidance also continues to contemplate approximately $100 million in cost savings for fiscal 2020
related to our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives. We now anticipate our
adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.2%. The rate includes this quarter's unplanned tax benefit from stock-
based compensation related to stock option exercises. It does not, however, include any further estimated
tax benefit related to potential future stock option exercises, given the dependency of that benefit on the
timing of those exercises. We continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14%
in fiscal 2020.
Finally, before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that shortly after our February 10
Innovation Day, Christian will be moving on to take an international assignment as the General Manager of
one of our European businesses. I want to thank Christian for his many contributions leading our investor
relations program, and also welcome, Danyal Hussain, who many of you already know, as our new Head

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Crédit Suisse.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I think one of the things we've been focused on is the retention -- the improvement in the retention. Can
you give us any sense of how are kind of the first half scale relative to the full year guidance?

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

Given that -- I think you could tell from our comments that it obviously improved in the second quarter.
We've tried to get away from -- with the new guidance that we started providing, I think it was a year
ago, we're trying to get away from quarterly guidance. But we're still committed to giving you kind of
a sense of kind of where we are. And I think you can tell from my, I think, prepared comments that we
had a good first quarter, and we also had a good second quarter. So retention is definitely a positive for
us. Like we talked about last quarter, in terms of some of the bright spots, our mid-market business
retention continues to improve and is on track to really get to this year close to record levels. So it's very,
very satisfying because we went through a very difficult time back in the day where we did all the client
upgrades and migrations. And then with ACA, at the same time, that was a business where we really had
a real step-back of retention. By the way, step-back, for us, is a couple of percentage points. And now
we've recovered all of that and are kind of on track to get back to kind of where we were at record levels.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Understood. And then just...

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

I'm sorry. Another comment was I think we also, in the first half, have had good retention in the
upmarket, which was another place that's been kind of a challenge for us over the last couple of years. So
I think both of those businesses, when you combine them, they're a significant portion of our revenues,
and I think are -- have a solid retention performance.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's super helpful. As a quick follow-up, despite revenue adjustments, it seems like you're maintaining
the margin guidance. I guess what's driving that outperformance given kind of the revenue adjustments in
the PEO and I guess, overall?

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

We have -- our business model's interesting because sometimes, at least for the first half because we --
as you can tell, we're hoping and planning on a recovery in terms of our sales results for the second half.
But in general, we benefited in the first half from an expense standpoint from having weaker new business
bookings because as you know, our business has a little bit of a self-adjusting factor. Now the new 606
rules, I think when you amortize some of these costs over time, they brought some of that impact, but
there's still some impact from that. So we did benefit from that. And we just have a lot of good things
going on from a margin standpoint, we really want to make sure that we focus on the growth as well, but
we feel pretty good about the initiatives that we've put in place, call it, last fiscal year that are impacting
this year's cost structure. And I think those -- we've talked about those procurement initiatives, also the

9

AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

workforce optimization, which was a delayering exercise, where we reduced spends and control. So we
took 3 layers out and increased spends across the board, including all the way at the very highest levels
where we had, for us, a -- I would call it, a significant decrease in overhead, if you will, in terms of our
most senior levels. And so I think we're benefiting from all of those items. And that's helping the margin.
So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of costs and margin. We have a lot of transformation
initiatives around costs and margins. And obviously, we want to make sure that we be focused on growth
in new business bookings as well.

Kathleen A. Winters
Corporate Vice President & CFO

Yes. Not too much to add to that. A lot of -- Carlos covered a lot of the points, but we're seeing the
operating efficiency come through. We're executing on the transformation projects that we have in
flight right now, saw a little bit better-than-expected margin expansion in the second quarter, primarily
some timing on some of the transformation work. But look, the team's executing really nicely on that,
particularly on the procurement side. And we're focused on continuing to do that and building the pipeline
of additional opportunities.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

And just one little item in terms of color. You'll see from the queue that credit to the organization, but
again, a lot of these transformation initiatives have been -- some of them, when we talk about some of
the big ones, we have dozens of other initiatives that are really improving the way we work, automating
things, taking out kind of non-value-added work. And when you look at our Q, you'll see that it's really
R&D and selling expense that have increased. And we really are holding the line on the rest of our
operating expenses, due in large part to some of these initiatives that we have underway that are making
work a little bit easier for our associates and also taking some of the workout. And so that's the key
because we want to make sure that we keep, and we are keeping our NPS scores and our retention high.
And so that's the magic formula there. I think keeping our expenses low and improving margin, if it results
in lower client satisfaction and lower retention, is not going to help us in the long term. But fortunately,
again, credit to the associates and to the management team, we're actually pulling it off, where we're
getting both of those things right now.

Operator

Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats to Christian and Danny. I want to ask on, well, I guess, a bigger picture question maybe for
the team. Just balancing -- you’re balancing the new tech investments, and you just mentioned the
transformation initiatives in the pipeline there. But just given that you're a year early, you're on track to
get to your fiscal year targets this year -- for fiscal '21, I'm sorry, are you more willing to invest, let's say,
in the short to midterm to maybe energize revenue growth and get that up a little bit more? Or is your
preference to still hit the higher end of your long-term margin target? I'm just trying to understand how
you might be balancing revenue growth and margin expansion given where you are now.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

That's a great -- it's a great question. And I think our Board obviously has that discussion with us as
well. And I think our Board is very long-term oriented. And so as much as we're committed to hitting all
the individual components, it's about balancing all of those factors to really create long-term sustainable
growth. And we would love to have as much growth as possible. And when I think about where are some
of those places that we could invest, as an example, like in our sales organization, we are fully staffed.
I think we're probably a little bit ahead of our plans in terms of headcount. So we clearly have some
execution issues there, especially, as we mentioned, in our international and multinational businesses and

10

AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

some difficult compared to over last year. But we have really strong performance in the downmarket and
in the mid-market and even in the domestic upmarket this quarter. So it doesn't feel like we're under-
investing. In fact, I'm pretty sure that we're not under-investing in sales and marketing. We also have
a brand campaign that we've invested in over the last year, which has added some expense. So I think
we've put our money where our mouth is when it comes to sales and marketing. And then turning to
the other obvious places where we could invest, again, for growth and product in our R&D organization,
again, our R&D group would always say that we could spend more. But when I look at the year-over-year
and even a 3-year growth of our investments in our next-gen platforms and even some of the additional
feature functionality that we're adding to our existing products, including user experience, that's, again,
a place where our investments are growing. So we are -- you can see it from our depreciation and
amortization line, when you see it in the Q and you can see it from our and hear from our words that we
are -- and you can see in our balance sheet in terms of capitalized software. So we believe that we are
investing for the future. And that when we have sometimes, you have these timing issues because we
do have a lot of enthusiasm, for example, about our next-gen platforms. But relative to the size of the
company, when -- this is the year -- this is the first year where we have, over the last 12 months is the
first time we've actually got clients now live on our next-gen platforms, including next-gen payroll and
next-gen HCM, which we call Lifion. So we're excited. We're ahead of plan, but you have less than 10
clients on one of the platforms and call it, 30 to 40 clients on another one of those platforms. So it just
doesn't make a difference yet in terms of the sales results or the revenue results, but it doesn't dampen
our enthusiasm around the future. So again, I guess, the long and short of it is, I don't think it's a lack of
investment, but trust us that if we see an opportunity to invest for growth, we'll take it.

Tien-Tsin Huang
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Understood. And then just maybe on that point, with the ES bookings, it sounds like it's more international
again. So I'm curious if this is more cyclical or is there -- some very broad base? Or is it more just [ fees ]
like clients that you're looking for a decision? Just trying to better understand how -- the visibility here on
the international side.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

I think the most obvious one in terms of -- because it's easy to see and quantify, is in our large global
view, multinational deals. We had a very difficult compare. Now of course, that means that 12 months
ago, we were celebrating getting those deals and those sales. And hopefully, we talked about it, that,
that was giving us tailwind at the time. And I think we did, but we'd have to go back to the transcripts.
And now -- unfortunately, now we have a very difficult compare. Now we just had our rethink meeting.
We call it rethink meeting, where we have all of our large multinational prospects and clients. And I
think we walked away with a very solid pipeline and a lot of enthusiasm. And so we feel good about,
hopefully, the second half. And whether it's the second half or next year, but any less enthusiastic about
our multinational solutions, but we just have a very difficult compare. So that's an obvious place. We do
have a couple of, what we call, in-country or best-of-breed locations that are also having some challenges
that I think also have some difficult compares. But it's hard to point at any kind of cyclical or product
issues because we've been strengthening our products overseas as well and I think, investing in our sales
force. So again, and the European economy in particular seems to be at a minimum stabilizing, if not
improving. So I don't think we can point to anything cyclical, which is why we remain optimistic about a
turnaround.

Kathleen A. Winters
Corporate Vice President & CFO

Yes. So maybe I'll just add a little more color and talk about it in terms of kind of ES bookings overall. I
guess, what I'd say is that, look, as you go into the year, there's always going to be areas where you do
better and areas where you do worse than you may have planned. And thus far, into the year, we've seen
particular strength in downmarket, as we've noted in our comments. And actually, internationally, we've
also seen strength in our Celergo streamline product, which was quite nice to see. And as you saw, the
multinational global view is where we're seeing really the slowness or the weakness for the last 2 quarters

now. Hard to say that it's -- we're not really seeing that it's attributable to any change from an economic
landscape or environment standpoint, but more so just seeing delayed decision-making. And it's taking
time to get these larger and sometimes much more complex deals through the decision-making process.
So we've seen it 2 quarters in a row. The pipeline looks pretty decent. We've got some of these deals in
the pipeline, but it remains to be seen exactly how much longer it takes to get them closed.

Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.

Ramsey Clark El-Assal
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Can I ask you to give us kind of a brief macro overview in terms of what you're seeing in your various
markets, given everything that's going on in the world today? Any call-outs or any changes in the
environment?

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

So when we look at -- we have a few things that we obviously look at in terms of, call it, economic macro
indicators. The ones that are kind of relatively stable, I would call them relatively stable, our pays per
control and wage growth. And we look at, obviously, our own data as we get ready for this earnings call,
but we also have the ADP Research Institute that publishes its own kind of wage growth information
and other factors around the economy. And I think all those signs positive -- point to, what I would call,
stability. Our pays per control was slightly lower than it was the previous quarter and the trend, but we've
seen that many times before where we go 2.5% one quarter, and then we go a little bit lower than next
quarter, but then it comes back to 2.5%. It does seem, and we've been saying it, and we've been wrong
so far that as the labor markets tighten, there's just not enough people available in the U.S. to continue to
drive the kind of pays per control growth that we've experienced. But obviously, labor force participation
has been ticking up slightly. And for a variety of reasons, that continued to hum along. And again, we see
the same kind of indicators that all of you see around consumer spending, et cetera. So when we look
at across all of our domestic businesses, the pays per control growth seems to be a reasonable indicator
that the economy is on stable ground. And wage growth, we think, should continue to accelerate, but
that's moderated slightly also for the last couple of quarters, but it's still at robust levels and should
drive continued consumer spending and continued consumer confidence. We do look at pays per control
also outside of the U.S. And I think there, we, again, in our numbers, see some signs of stabilization
in Europe when it comes through in the unemployment and pays per control metrics there. So for us,
I think that everything looks -- bankruptcies are -- we're seeing the same things in our own business
that you see through external metrics. We don't see any kind of elevation of -- or increase in out-of-
business or bankruptcies in our downmarket business, which is the canary in the coal mines, the first
place you would see it. So our sales are also strong in the downmarket and the mid-market, so it doesn't
feel like the weakness we had this quarter is anything other than the lumpiness that we talked about
around multinationals because new business bookings would be another, I think, macro indicator that
could weaken. We've talked about our retention continuing to improve. Retention doesn't improve in a bad
economy because it -- that's one of the things that really suffers as a result of out-of-business in the down
market. And that has stayed strong and solid, so no negatives that we can see in the macro.

Ramsey Clark El-Assal
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And you sort of addressed this. Dovetailing with Kathleen's last answer and your answer just now,
but can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment? And that doesn't -- manifesting itself as
sort of pricing-related actions or an intensification of maybe more an increase in opposing bidders showing
up for contract processes or new business models emerging out there. I'm just trying to explore whether
there's any other peripheral causes for some of the, I think, what are timing-related delays and things like
bookings, especially maybe in Europe, but elsewhere as well.

AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

CEO, President & Director

Sure. So back to maybe a little bit of what Kathleen said about, there's always -- there's positive and
there's negative. When it comes to competitors, it's the same thing. We have a lot of competitors in each
of our each of our segments. And some years we do better, some of the years we do worse, but we do
have the overall balance of trade. And our situation there is better. And you would think that based on
our retention results, and based on the comment we just gave you about new business bookings in our
downmarket, mid-market and domestic upmarket business. So I think in North America, I think if you
look at those results, I would say our competitive situation has improved. And it shows in our net balance
of trade that we keep track of. In particular, I would point out, besides the continued strength in our
downmarket business, which has been growing market share here for a few years, if you look at our mid-
market business, the last 2 quarters in particular were quite strong in terms of what we call new logos
against a variety of competitors. But again, we can't point to any one competitor because we have a large
set of competitors. Some of them are geographically concentrated, and some of them are national. But
I think we're very pleased with this quarter's performance against those competitors in the mid-market.
And then in the upmarket, I would say that the addition of Workforce Now and call it, the 1,000 to 5,000
range, so the lower end of our upmarket, which we did a couple of years ago, has really been an important
generator of win-loss and balance of trade success for us in the upmarket. So we've had a robust growth
in units, in revenue and sales dollars from introduction of Workforce Now into that 1,000 to 5,000, which
addresses a segment of the market where that platform really has a lot of appeal.

Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America.

Jason Alan Kupferberg
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

I just wanted to drill in a little bit more on the commentary around the delayed decision-making. Have you
guys been down-selected for these contracts already? Or is the actual RFP process still kind of dragging
along?

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

I wish I could tell you that I have that level of detail. I don't. So this is really -- ties back to the comment
I made before about we have a certain number of salespeople in the field. We have a certain pipeline of
dollars that we track year-over-year. And we know what our sales results were the previous year in the
same period, whether it was the first quarter or the first 2 quarters of the year. So we are attributing
the weakness to the late decision-making. But this is not -- we do have large contracts, particularly in
multinational, and they definitely move the number from one quarter to the other, but we don't have $50
million, $100 million contracts. It's not that kind of a business. So we don't -- I know our sales leaders
have that level of detail. I don't have it available in my fingertips here.

Kathleen A. Winters
Corporate Vice President & CFO

Yes. I mean, maybe you're asking kind of have we seen any particular shift in where things are in terms
of stages of the cycle and stages in the pipeline? Nothing that we've seen or heard that we can draw any
conclusion from or point to any trends.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

But we do have a pipeline of deals. I mean, sure, we wanted to rethink this year with more participants,
more attendees in a larger pipeline of dollar opportunities than we had the previous year.

AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

Right. Yes. No, I was just curious if you were just kind of waiting for some final signatures to make the
bookings official or if it really is a matter of kind of just broader pipeline conversion. Just my second quick
follow-up, just on the margins, you had the 70 bps up overall in the quarter, which was better than you
expected. But at the segment level, I know ES was up only 30. And PEO was down 30, if I'm not mistaken.
So I think it was some of the below-the-line drivers that got you to the 70. Can you elaborate on those?
Because I know you have some add-backs in your adjusted EBIT margin calculation.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

Yes, I can help maybe a little bit with that. It's -- as you know, the transformation initiatives that we
are undergoing right now, some of those are sort of back-office-facing as well. So if you think about
procurement and the workforce optimization initiative, those will have impacts to items that are, what
we would deem, other in the segment review. So corporate functions, for example, that's where the delta
probably sits for you.

Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Let me add my congratulations to both Christian and Danny. With regards to the bookings, just looking
ahead, and thinking about the comparisons for the third and fourth quarters, are there any things that we
should think from a sequencing perspective in terms of they're both -- one's up 10%, one's up 11%? Is
there anything that's particular in one versus the other that would make it a more difficult comp? Or how
should we think about the bookings over the next 2 quarters in terms of the sequencing?

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

Well, I think our #1 goal is to obviously maintain the momentum we have in everything other than our
international and multinational businesses. And again, these businesses, not just because there's a big
ocean between them, they are fairly separate, right, in terms of how they're managed in terms of sales
and sales execution and so forth even though we have one worldwide sales organization. So we feel good
that we're going to be able to maintain the momentum we have in the rest of the business. And then
hopefully, we get a little bit of a tailwind with some of this stuff going our way in terms of the larger deals
and some of the international stuff that we've talked about. We do have -- in the second half, particularly
in the last quarter, we do have a difficult compare. Because last year, as you recall, we purchased -- it
was a client-based acquisition -- an acquisition of the company with a client-based acquisition of Wells
Fargo's payroll business. And that helped our new business bookings and obviously our -- translated
into some revenue help in the downmarket and as part of what's given us some tailwind from a revenue
growth standpoint in that business. But since it was a client-based acquisition, it does -- and it wasn't an
acquisition of a business, it does roll through our new business bookings. And that was, I believe, in the
fourth quarter.

Kathleen A. Winters
Corporate Vice President & CFO

Fourth quarter.

Yes, yes. That's not -- probably not show as well. So -- and that's part of the reason for asking the
question. So arguably, the third quarter should be a little bit of an easier comp.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

And there's one reason -- for some reason, they never feel easy. But mathematically, you're probably
mathematically correct, but we have a lot of things that we're cooking to make sure that we hit the --
obviously, our intention is to achieve the guidance we've provided. And we wouldn't -- we don't provide it
lightly.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Great. And then, Carlos, obviously, you've got a long-standing sort of experiences with the PEO market.
How are you feeling about the longer-term trajectory of the market? What are you seeing? What do you
think are thinking? Or ex pass-throughs, the sustainable growth rate is there? And what are you seeing
from -- on the competitive front, it seems like there's a little bit more private capital that's coming into the
space. So just wondering what your -- how you're thinking about that space and the legislative outlook
there.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

Well, when you look at the -- again, the balance of trade information there, I feel pretty good about our
competitive situation, right? So you always feel good about your own children and about your businesses.
But you've got to look at the facts, right? And I think the facts are pretty good for us in terms of our win-
loss and our balance of trade. So that feels pretty good. And then the second thing that makes me feel
really good, particularly this quarter versus last year and started to feel it last quarter, is we really took a
while to kind of filter through to make sure that we had our incentives properly aligned to make sure that
our sales force was focused on, obviously, number one, selling the right thing to our clients, but making
sure that they're properly incented to make sure that the PEO is something that they raised. Because it is
a difficult sale because it's a high-involvement sale. And so you have to have the right incentives in order
for the sales force to really want to sell it. And so I think we did that, and I think we talked about that.
It's got to be 12 months ago, I think it was. So that feels like it's starting to filter through. And I think
we talked about very strong double-digit new business bookings for the quarter, which that's the most
important metric to -- for the future to really give us confidence that the business model is still strong and
intact. So that feels pretty good.

Our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies.

Samad Saleem Samana
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So I wanted to maybe ask a question about the -- what's been going on in terms of bookings and how
you're thinking about guidance. Is there -- was guidance updated just to reflect what bookings has done
so far this year? Or have you maybe made some changes to the guidance framework to account for some
more of the variability or variance that you're seeing in multinational and international deals closing? So
I guess, is guidance more conservative? Are you using the same framework that you've historically used?
And then maybe just one follow-up.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Again, just a reminder, just given the last comment that I made about the PEO that the guidance that
we provide for bookings is ES only, just to be clear. So if you look at our combination of our PEO and ES
sales, they're -- it's a better picture and a stronger picture in the first half than what our guidance would
depict because we provide guidance for the PEO based on average worksite employee growth, not on new

business bookings. But having said that, I think the answer is just in a -- this year, like there's no change
in our thinking or our framework, given that we just think there's some large deal delays that I don't think
impact our view of the future.

Kathleen A. Winters
Corporate Vice President & CFO

Yes, no change in framework. No change in kind of the way we're rolling up that forecast or the data
we're looking at. For example, we look at things like, okay, where is business coming from in terms of by
segment or by geography or new clients versus upsell to existing clients? We're continuing to see fairly
consistent trends in terms of the split between new and upsells. So no change in the framework. It's more
so just, look, we've seen the slower out of the gates for 2 quarters now, lower than we expected in the
international. And so we saw it was given that we're 6 months into the year here, we thought it made
sense to give you our best view. And so therefore, we narrowed the view for the year.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Just one other comment that in terms of something a little bit quirky about as we changed our
guidance to focus on ES worldwide bookings versus the PEO based on average worksite employees, the
reason we gave you some color about the bookings for the PEO this quarter is even though we're not
going to change the way we do our guidance is, in some respects, what's good for the PEO, sometimes
in the short term if business gets referred to the PEO, can have in the short term a dampening effect on
Employer Services. But we still had a great result in the downmarket and in the mid-market in Employer
Services. So we definitely can't point to that. But again, it is kind of important to keep in mind that it's
really the combination of those 2 that are driving overall ADP bookings and overall ADP revenue growth.

Samad Saleem Samana
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could just ask one follow-up. I think there's a lot of excitement
around Lifion coming off of HR Tech and ahead of the Innovation Day that the company is hosting so I just
wanted to see if there's any early patterns in terms of customer profile, whether it's by size or whether
you think about existing products that they're using, whether it's Vantage or Workforce Now. Maybe where
are you seeing the early adopters come from? And any type of profile commentary you could give on that
would be helpful.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

So again, in our case, everybody's maybe approaches this differently. But we started off with smaller, less
complex clients. And now we've actually just sold, I would call, consider it to be very large clients, so call
it, tens of thousands of employees. And so we've got a couple of very large sales that we've done. And
we have a bunch in the middle and then we have a few smaller ones that we did in the early days. Some
of the business we've sold is obviously new logo. Some of it has been, as you mentioned, off of some of
our existing platforms. I don't think that I can point to one particular platform and say they were like --
we're not targeting because we're not trying to do migrations or upgrades, we're trying to go after clients
that have the right profile and the right needs, right? So that we can make them happier ADP clients in
the long term. So we know what the capabilities are of the platform, and we try to target the clients and
the prospects, whether they're internal or external, in the appropriate manner. So I guess the best way to
put it is kind of across the board in terms of from an internal view. And then in terms of industry or size of
client, fortunately, it's also kind of a widespread.

AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

There have been a few questions on bookings already, but this seems to be the main question of the
day, that the one question that I'd like to explore here is, you're still in the critical selling season,
which typically runs December to February. So is there anything you see in your pipeline in the U.S. or
confidence on international close rates that gives you the confidence that you can close this critical selling
season in better shape than we've seen, obviously, in the second quarter and the first quarter bookings
results?

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

So again, at the risk of getting too much into the sausage-making, the -- if you remember, like part of
our business, particularly the downmarket and into some of our mid-market, we report our sales when
they start. So they're -- like bookings and starts are basically equivalent. But when you get to very large
deals, that's where you're really recognizing a sale. And then the revenue starts at a later date. It could
be 6 months. It could be 12 months. With a very large complex international deal, it could be 18 months
later. So to your point about the critical selling season, pretty much now and done because January is
the biggest month for us, particularly for our downmarket business and the lower end of our mid-market
business as well and the PEO. So just because of the natural cycle of the PEO, a large number of clients,
by the way, affect retention as well. But from a new business booking standpoint, January is the critical
month for us. So the December-January period is a critical month for us in the PEO. And again, we're in
the middle of that quarter. So it's kind of hard to make comments about the quarter since the quarter isn't
done yet. But I think in a down market and in our PEO in particular, we had, I'd say, a good start to the
quarter.

Kathleen A. Winters
Corporate Vice President & CFO

Yes. The only thing -- other thing I would add, and this is with regard to the ES bookings in particular. If
you kind of look at the cadence of the year last year and this year and you look at 6 months year-to-date,
we're at about the same point this year as we were last year in comparison to where we ended the year.

David Mark Togut
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So in other words, you see enough in the pipeline at this point and expected close rates that drive your
expectation of the 6% to 7% bookings target? Is that accurate?

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

I think that -- again, that is a level of detail to say that we have specific things in the pipeline. I think
just to reiterate what we said before, so the #1 driver of our confidence in our sales results in most of
our business is headcount and execution. And we believe we're fully staffed, and we have that headcount
in place. In the place where we've had the variability or the volatility, if you will, it does come down to
what you're describing, which is RFPs, pipeline, et cetera. Yes, we do believe we have the pipeline and
the visibility of that pipeline to feel that we will close the gap for the rest of the year. But that's not the
-- in our SBS business, in our downmarket business, it doesn't work that way. It's really more about the
volume. It's a volume business that's really related to having the proper amount of headcount, the right
digital marketing tools and spend. And again, there, we feel good and we feel confident.

Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I'm apologizing for asking another bookings-related question. I just wanted to clarify something. I'm
assuming that most of your clients are on calendar year-end as opposed to your June year-end. When you

17

AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 29, 2020

talk about the late decision-making, does this mean that the decisions are being deferred until another
year from now? Or is it something that could happen within the next quarter or so?

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

So the good news for ADP is we have clients with all kinds of year-ends because we have a lot of clients.
So it really spans the gamut. But you're right that probably the average company in the U.S. has a
calendar year-end. But I think most large companies, and particularly multinationals, which ADP -- I
would consider ADP to be one of those, we -- typically, when we are negotiating with a vendor for a
large contract, we'd be focused more on their fiscal year-end rather than our own fiscal year-end. And so
you're right that there are some drivers around people's budgets and so forth, but a lot of procurement
departments tend to focus on the vendor's year-end. And so we've seen, historically, it doesn't mean
that it will happen again this year, is that our fourth quarter for large domestic and especially for large
multinational deals is a particularly important quarter. Because prospects are recognized that even though
we're not like a typical software company that -- negotiating towards a company's fiscal year-end, at least
in their minds, tends to be a good time to sign deals or negotiate.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay, I appreciate the....

Christian Greyenbuhl
Vice President of Investor Relation

Sorry, Jeff. Just one reminder. I know we said it before, but the 1% impact on an annual basis in business
bookings equating to about $17 million, I mean, these multinational, particularly global view deals, you
can imagine that if you take that on a quarterly basis, it does have -- just put it in perspective, that
outsized impact. So it's just from a framing perspective. It is a pretty meaningful adjustment if you have
some of these deals that flow in from one quarter to the next given that sensitivity.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

On the new business bookings results.

Christian Greyenbuhl
Vice President of Investor Relation

On the new business bookings results.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

Right. Because on a revenue, as you just described, the irony of the situation is that as it doesn't have a
big impact on revenue, like we're having issues with FX and with client funds interest in particular that are
hurting us, it's not to deny that the bookings eventually will have some impact, but the types of bookings
that we have fallen short on in the first half are not particularly revenue impactful.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay, that's helpful. I do appreciate the color on that. And then I know you don't give quarterly guidance,
but you called out, I guess, the comp on the, I guess, "acquisition" of the Wells Fargo payroll business last
year. Anything else to call out between 3Q and 4Q that might affect the cadence of those quarters?

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

No. No. The overall business, either revenues or margins.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

Well, I mean, again, back to revenues and margins, the -- this client funds interest issue, and again, going
back to kind of the 3-year guidance that we gave a few years ago, again, obviously not expecting a lot
of sympathy from this crowd, but we're probably about $100 million less than what we expected to be
in terms of client funds interest that we're obviously able to -- which we're overcoming some of that as
we go forward here. And the -- so that in the second half is actually going to -- according to what I'm
seeing in terms of our forecast, that's going to start to have an impact on revenue growth as well. It's
not a huge impact, but where we were getting, call it, 1% lift in terms of revenue growth last year in the
second quarter, I think this second quarter, it was a much smaller number. And in the second half, it goes
to probably no help to actually hurting our revenue growth. So that's a headwind for us. But when I really
take out all these issues, FX, client funds interest and other kind of calendar noise issues, when you look
at the net impact of new business bookings starts, not new business booking sales, but new business
bookings starts minus losses, so if you take retention and new business that started, if you compare last
year's second quarter to this year's second quarter, and that, hopefully, the same thing continues into the
second half, we have a slight acceleration. It's not a huge acceleration, but a slight acceleration. And so
that's what makes me feel good about the strength in the underlying business. Because there's a lot of
noise happening in between with calendar. And remember, last year, we also had a one-time item that we
mentioned that we call a SUI pull-forward, and the PEO is an accounting change that we were obligated to
make that helped the second quarter revenue growth. So all those things, you have to kind of separate all
of those and get down to the core of the business and how the core business is performing. And on that
basis, I feel good about the quarter, and I feel good about the second half.

Kathleen A. Winters
Corporate Vice President & CFO

Yes. The only other thing I would add to your question about kind of quarterly linearity in the balance of
the year. Just as a reminder, in the second half of last year, we had much, much more margin expansion in
Q3 than in Q4. So therefore, tougher comps for us this year, Q3 versus Q4, in terms of margin expansion.
So while we don't give quarterly guidance, I would expect not a whole lot in Q3 and then potentially much
more in Q4.

CEO, President & Director

But again, back to like in terms of what I mentioned in terms of some of these comparisons that were
difficult versus last year's second quarter, some of those things then get easier on a revenue standpoint.
Notwithstanding the issues from client funds interest, the SUI pull-forward actually helped last year's
second quarter, but depressed our third quarter. So that's going to make an easier comparison. So we do
expect slight improvement in our revenue growth in the second half.

Christian Greyenbuhl
Vice President of Investor Relation

And just a brief reminder on the fourth quarter. So as a reminder, so we did the client-based acquisition.
So that added some amortization expense, which we'll lap in the fourth quarter, and obviously with
bookings -- increased booking expense related to the client-based acquisition as well. So just keep that in
mind. And then we obviously launched our brand campaign, I think, in the third quarter, but most of that
was really -- the expense was kicking off in the fourth quarter as well. So that will be lapped as well.

I guess what we're saying is we have some tailwinds in the fourth quarter.

Christian Greyenbuhl
Vice President of Investor Relation

Yes.

And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Lisa Ellis from
MoffettNathanson.

Lisa Ann Dejong Ellis

Congrats to Christian and Danny from me as well. Carlos, you mentioned a couple of times, and I think
in the presentation, the progress on both Lifion as well as the next-gen payroll and tax, can you give an
update of where you are on the deployments of the next-gen payroll and tax engines and how they're
impacting your business perhaps on the retention side or some of the other impacts?

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

Sure. Thanks. Very excited about the next-gen payroll as well as the back office tax. But the payroll
engine, even though it's somewhat back-office, I think, has some positive qualities in terms of potentially
helping us, both in terms of, in the future, both around bookings but also around efficiency and costs.
I think we have somewhere between 30 and 40 live clients in our next-generation payroll platform. So
as you can imagine, in comparison to the size of ADP, it's a relatively small impact in terms of revenue
retention or any of the other actual metrics. But an enormous amount of enthusiasm around what we're
doing there, both at the team level. I think the team is incredibly enthusiastic. And I think the rest of the
organization is very enthusiastic as well in terms of what we're seeing in the early days, especially around
the flexibility of how quickly we can, for example, make changes. And that's just related really to the
investments in the platform itself. So we've already kind of experimented, and I think we maybe talked
about this in the past, with kind of federation, as you call it, in trying to have others develop and build on
that platform. We've done the same thing on Lifion. So now we have a team, for example, in Australia that
has actually built Australian payroll, and we have 1 or 2 clients on that as well. And so we're incredibly
happy with what we're seeing. We're really happy that we have live clients. And this is the first year that,
again, even though it was, call it, 30 to 40 clients, this is the first time we've gone through year-end.
So who we actually had to go through a year-end and do all the year-end closing activities are probably,
enthused, et cetera. So it's still very early days just because of the size of ADP. But if we were a start-up,
this would be like really great news. Like if this is a discussion about a start-up, like we've gotten now a
lot of technical risk behind us, if you will, and now we have scaling and execution risk that's still in front of
us, but that's a hell of a lot better than where we would have been 2 to 3 years ago. And I think it could
really add to our competitiveness here in the long run, not to mention it could help a lot in terms of back-
office costs. On the tax side, that's probably more focused on back-office costs and efficiency, but that also
has an impact on our associates in terms of their ability to deliver service and also the experience that our
clients have when we do things like amendments and tax notices. And so again, the news there is very
positive. We have -- I think it's close to 140,000 to 150,000 clients?

Kathleen A. Winters
Corporate Vice President & CFO

Yes, about 140,000 clients.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

About 140,000 clients. Obviously, those are smaller downmarket clients in a limited number of
jurisdictions. But I think we've -- now we're up to 20 -- more than 20 jurisdictions. Jurisdictions, by the
way, refers the number of states, in addition to the federal places where we can actually do the taxes.

And so I'd say that that's progressing also very, very well. Again, highly flexible platform that -- very
optimistic in terms of what it can do to us down the road and seeing no scaling issues so far in either of
those platforms.

And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to
Carlos Rodríguez for any closing remarks.

Carlos A. Rodriguez
CEO, President & Director

So as you can tell, we're pretty -- we're pleased with the progress we continue to make on both the
financials, but also on our strategy. Obviously, as we keep saying over and over again, we're trying to
build on our success in the past, but also transform for the future here, so we can continue to deliver
sustainable growth for many years to come. I also want to mention that this time of the year, somebody
mentioned about this being a busy time of the year for us from a sales standpoint. It's also a very busy
time for our associates to deliver service and also our year-end commitments to our clients very long
hours and very hard work, and I really appreciate the commitment of our associates. And again, it's one of
the great differentiators we have in terms of being able to deliver that level of service, especially in a very
busy time of the year like we are right now. Obviously, we wouldn't be able to be successful in the long
run without strong products. And so when we have our Investor Day, we're going to hopefully lay out a
plan for you about how the sustainability of the strength of ADP will be, I think, helped by the investments
we've been making over the last 5 years in our next-generation products. So we look forward to spending
time with you on February 10 to discuss all these innovations that we've been investing in, in addition to
the next-gen platform and also discussing a little bit of our vision for the future about how we expect work
to change and the HCM industry to change.

And with that, I want to thank you once again for your interest in ADP and for joining us today. Thank you.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program,
and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.
