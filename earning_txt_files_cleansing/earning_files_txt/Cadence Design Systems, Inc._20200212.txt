Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon. My name is Jesse, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Cadence Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the call over to Alan Lindstrom, Senior Group Director of Investor Relations for
Cadence. Go ahead.

Alan H. Lindstrom
Senior Group Director of Investor Relations

Thank you, Jessie, and I would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference
call.

I am joined today by Lip-Bu Tan, Chief Executive Officer; and John Wall, Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer. The webcast of this call is available through our website, cadence.com, and will be
archived through March 13, 2020. A copy of today's prepared remarks will also be available on our website
at the conclusion of the call today.

Please note that the discussion today will contain forward-looking statements, and that the actual results
may differ materially from those expectations. For information on the factors that could cause a difference
in our results, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These include
Cadence's most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, including the company's future filings and
the cautionary comments regarding forward-looking statements in the earnings press release issued
today.

In addition to financial results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or
GAAP, we will also present certain non-GAAP financial measures today. Cadence management believes that
in addition to using GAAP results in evaluating our business, it can also be useful to review results using
certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Investors and potential investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial
measures with their most direct comparable GAAP financial results. The reconciliations are available at the
Investor Relations section of cadence.com. Copies of today's press release dated February 12, 2020, for
the quarter ended December 28, 2019, related financial tables and the CFO commentary are also available
on our website.

And now I'll turn the call over to Lip-Bu.

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered a
strong Q4, achieved excellent operating results for the year. For 2019, amid the environmental headwinds,
we delivered 9% year-over-year revenue growth and 32% non-GAAP operating margin with strength
across our product lines. John will provide more details shortly.

Macro uncertainty and geopolitical headwinds persist into 2020, but strong design activity continues at
both advanced nodes as well as More than Moore front. This is being driven by generational technology
drivers. 5G, AI and machine learning, hyperscale computing, industrial IoT and autonomous vehicles,
which have all helped semiconductors at their foundation, and are propelling the need for next-generation
computing, connectivity and storage.

I believe these trends, in addition to system companies developing custom silicon domain-specific
processing, computing, silicon start-ups and digital transformation of vertical segments, like industrial and
aerospace and defense, will continue to fuel silicon renaissance over the next few years.

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

In 2019, we unveiled our Intelligent System Design strategy that will enable us to maximize these
opportunities, while tripling our TAM through proliferation in foundational design excellence segment and
expanding beyond EDA into system innovation and pervasive intelligence. We achieved strong growth
in design excellence, which is comprised of core EDA and IP, fueled by the launch of several innovative
products as well as wide-ranging expansion of our solutions, particularly at market shipping customers.

Our digital and signoff business achieved double-digit revenue growth for the year as strong proliferation
continued driven by customer demand for solutions offering best-in-class performance, power area and
time to market capabilities.

Our market shipping global mobile company expanded their partnership with us through a large and
comprehensive EDA software booking, which included a significant expansion of our digital footprint.
Building upon successful 7-nanometer designs, Cadence and Broadcom expanded their collaborations to
include the creation of 5-nanometer designs using Cadence digital implementation solutions.

We have about 50 new full flow wins in 2019, including a recent full flow competitive win for new advanced
node designs, with a leading maker of FPGA chips. During the year, we announced successful -- successes
in our digital business with customers such as MediaTek, Samsung, Socionext, Innovium, Mellanox and
Uhnder.

Verification is one of the top challenges of our customers, and our verification suite had several wins
across multiple vertical segments in 2019. Our Xcelium parallel simulator with this innovative rocket tech
technology continues to proliferate and recently had a noteworthy win at the leading U.S. computing
company.

Our hardware family comprised of Palladium Z1 emulator and recently introduced Protium X1 FPGA-based
prototyping platform, provide a comprehensive solution across IP and SOC verification, hardware-software
regressions and earlier software development.

Due to a common front end compiler, this complementary platforms, when working in tandem, deliver
even more compelling value to our customers. And we are getting strong traction with Protium X1 being
deployed at Palladium accounts.

Hardware had a record year, with significant expansion at several customers, while adding 19 new Z1 and
11 new X1 customers over the year, including a global marquee customer that plays one of the largest
hardware orders ever for Cadence.

2019 was an outstanding year for our IP business, with 16% year-over-year revenue growth. As our focus
strategy and strong portfolio leveraged the continuing IP outsourcing trend, while enabling customers to
accelerate their innovation and time to market.

It was an especially strong quarter and year for our Tensilica products, with wins in audio, imaging,
computer vision and machine learning. Loyalty growth was strong, particularly in the audio market, where
Tensilica HiFi DSP processor are increasingly proliferating in true wireless studio-based earbuds and the
next-generation smart speakers. Design IP had a great year as well, with strength in DDR, PCIE and our
112-gig SerDes products as we proliferate with customers in AI, 5G and cloud computing.

Early in the year, we augmented our partnership with a marquee U.S. semiconductor company through our
largest IP agreements -- arrangements ever, which included Tensilica processor IP, 112-gig SerDes IP as
well as additional memory and interface IP products.

Now let us move on to the system innovation segment of our Intelligent System Design strategy. In 2019,
we entered the system analysis market. An estimated $5 billion TAM opportunity by introducing 2 exciting
new products: the Clarity 3D Solver, the next-generation solution for electromagnetic field simulations;
and Celsius Thermal Solver, the industry first complete electrothermal co-simulation solution.

Increasing system complexity and time-to-market pressures are driving the need for far more engineering
simulations, while underscoring the significant performance and capacity limitation of existing industry

solutions. Both Clarity and Celsius are based on proven massive parallel architecture that delivers up to
10x faster performance, while maintaining gold standard accuracy.

We are extremely pleased with the ramp of these innovative products, with well over 90 evaluations
underway and more than 20 customers to date, including Micron, STMicro, TÜV SÜD, Realtek and
Ambarella. Generational industry trends are driving the need for increasing -- increased heterogeneous
integration, coupled with a slowing down of Moore's Law, drove strong demand for our advanced
packaging solutions, leading to double-digit year-over-year growth.

They are growing challenges in design products -- designing products for complex, high-frequency RF
application, especially in the 5G wireless, aerospace and defense and automotive segments. To that end,
we acquired AWR, a leader in high-frequency RF solution. We also acquire Integrand Software, which
provide a leading RF solution for analysis and extraction.

Integrating these technologies with our Virtuoso and Allegro platforms will enable us to offer a
comprehensive platform for RF millimeter wave products from initial design to simulation, implementation,
verification and manufacturing. We entered into a strategic alliance agreement with National Instruments,
which is focused on the design to test flow, enabling customers to improve quality and reduce time to
market.

Lastly, we extended our cloud leadership in EDA, providing customers with compelling productivity,
flexibility and scalability benefits. Adoption of our cloud portfolio accelerated, and we passed the 100
customer mark. TSMC partnered with Cadence and Microsoft on the first TSMC layout contest. Cadence
delivered CloudBurst space, Azuro environment that allows several hundreds of students to simultaneously
compete using Cadence layout tools.

With that, I will now turn the call over to John to review the financial result and provide our updated
outlook.

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased with our financial performance for Q4 and
2019.

Despite some macro headwinds, we grew revenue across all business groups and our focus on delivering
profitable revenue growth, resulted in 9% revenue growth and 32% non-GAAP operating margin for the
year.

Turning to the numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $600
million for the quarter and $2.336 billion for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 31%
for the quarter and 32% for the year.

GAAP EPS was $2.36 for the quarter and $3.53 for the year. GAAP EPS include a onetime GAAP-only tax
benefit of $2.06 for the quarter and $2.05 for the year. This tax benefit related to intercompany transfers
of certain intellectual property rights to Cadence's Irish subsidiary.

Excluding the onetime GAAP-only tax benefit, GAAP EPS were $0.30 for the quarter and $1.48 for the
year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.54 for the quarter and $2.20 for the year.

Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow, our cash balance totaled $705 million at year-end. Operating
cash flow in the fourth quarter was $159 million and $730 million for the full year. DSOs were 47 days,
and we repurchased $75 million of Cadence shares during Q4 for a total of $306 million for the year.

During 2019, we grew revenue by $198 million, with over $100 million of that incremental revenue growth
dropping through into non-GAAP operating income. That means we have now grown our annual revenue
by around $520 million since 2016, with around $280 million of that incremental revenue growth dropping
through into non-GAAP operating income.

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Now moving on to our fiscal guidance Q1 2020 we expect revenue in the range of $610 million to $620
million. Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.34; and
non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.55.

For the full year fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $2.545 billion to $2.585 billion. Non-GAAP
operating margin of 32% to 33%; GAAP EPS in the range of $1.46 and to $1.56. Non-GAAP EPS in the
range of $2.40 to $2.50. We expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $775 million to $825 million,
and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2020.

Our guidance assumes that the export limitations that exist today for certain customers will remain
in place for all of 2020. We recently completed 2 acquisitions, and we've included the impact of those
acquisitions in our guidance.

And finally, please note that fiscal 2020 will be a 53-week year for Cadence. You will find guidance and
additional items -- for additional items as well as further analysis in the CFO commentary available on our
website.

In conclusion, Cadence delivered another year of strong revenue growth and expanding profitability. Our
focus on delivering profitable revenue growth has resulted in a large portion of our revenue growth flowing
through to operating income over the past 3 years. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week and recent
acquisitions, our guidance assumes that trend will continue, with approximately half of revenue growth in
2020 flowing through to operating income.

I would like to thank our customers, partners and our hard-working employees for their continued
support, and I look forward to updating you on our progress for 2020.
And with that, operator, we'll now take questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Congratulations on a nice finish to the year. First question, on your new system products. It sounds like
you had some nice success there, gaining some wins. And wanted to maybe see if you could contrast or
compare how the typical engagement with the system products compares with that in the digital space,
where you've obviously had some success doing it, proliferating over the years. Do you think it could have
the same type of pattern in terms of initial engagement, one seat, and then proliferation over time? And
just how you're thinking about the runway of these products as you continue to go after this market?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes, Rick. This is Lip-Bu. Let me try to answer your questions.

First of all, we are excited about the system analysis space that we are going in on our system innovation
strategy. And there's about $5 billion, 10 market opportunity for us. And we initially are moving in with
the 2 new product organically developed, Clarity 3D Solver and also Celsius Thermal and one for the
EM fuel solver simulator, and then the other one is the electrothermal co-simulation software. And so
both are launching out the later part of last year, and both are proven massive parallel architecture,
10x performance, and we are excited and that the response had been very positive. More than 90, 9-0
evaluations, and we already have 20 customers, and I'll highlight a few.

So I think this is just early stage of entry, and these 2 products is addressing about $700 million of TAM
market opportunity. And clearly, we are excited about it, and that's really back into our core competence
in terms of computation and software, and also related to our EDA and then expanding to the system
level. And also, our customer request us to move into that, and so that we can really provide a more
compelling solution to the customer.

And to answer your question, would that be like digital? I know we take one step at a time, take one
ending at a time, and then gradually, we can proliferate in our customer-to-customer. And then beyond
that, then the customer is going to tell us what are the area will be interesting for them, what are the
future performance they are going to have. We still continue to be humble lending from our customer and
then really drive innovation within the company to do that. So I think, overall, stay tuned. It's still very
early in the game.

Richard Frank Valera
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division

Great. And then, John, a quick question for you on your acquisition of AWR. Can you say if there was
much of a deferred revenue haircut as you blended that into the model?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Rich. Yes, purchase accounting rules significantly limit the revenue we can recognize from both
AWR and Integrand in 2020. Combined, we've added $20 million to annual revenue in our guidance for
2020. Almost all of that from AWR. We expect both acquisitions to be dilutive to earnings in 2020, but we
expect them to be accretive in 2021.

Your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can you hear me okay?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Mitch. We can hear you.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Okay. Yes. So 2 questions for me. The first one is actually a little more technical. You guys are talking a
lot more about kind of going into RF space. Is this due to the fact that when you go to chip with design
architectures in the future, they're going to have more complex RFs? Am I thinking too complex about
that? Or is that kind of one of the reasons why you guys are pushing in that space?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. It's a very good question. Clearly, we are listening to the customer. As you all know, 5G is deploying,
and then most of the challenging on the 5G and some of the other application market is the RF, high-
frequency RF. And so we have been looking what is the best way to address this in terms of the
hydrogenous integration and all the complexity to put it together? And so we are delighted in a way have
been working with National Instruments, and we are delighted, able to acquire the AWR and then form a
partnership with National Instruments in terms of alliance partnership.

And clearly, the high-frequency RF solution they have, and then also, we just add-on another new
acquisition called Integrand Solutions, and that gives us a very compelling RF solution for the design. And
then, together with our Virtuoso and Allegro platform that we provide a very comprehensive platform for
RF millimeter wave product development, all the way from design to simulation to verification. And so
we are really excited about this integration of the solution, providing that really needed solution that the
customer want to design and then to verify. And that's why we are very excited about this acquisition.

Mitchell Toshiro Steves
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. That was very helpful. And then just for John, really quick. Just for the half-on-half operating
margin. You guys are starting at 30%, but you're talking to kind of work up pretty materially. So does
that imply that you're exiting kind of a 33%, 34% operating margin? Just trying to get any sort of help in
terms of what the margin should look like half on half.

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Mitch. The -- yes, I guess, in terms of -- certainly, the back half of the year, it will have a higher
margin profile than the first half of the year. Partly, that's due to the impact of the 53rd week. 53rd week
in Q4 will add about $40 million to annual revenue. But when you add the extra week of expenses, of
course, the upside to operating income is minimal there.

And then with the, like combined impact of the 53rd week and the acquisitions, basically, the impact of the
purchase accounting rules on the acquisition is kind of -- is bigger in the first half and the first quarter, and
kind of gradually reduces over time over the 4 quarters.

Operator

Your next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

A quick question on the IP side of the business. It sounds like it grew 16% year-over-year. Wondering if
that was all organic growth? And then, was most of that driven by Tensilica and the wireless earbuds?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. Tom, as I mentioned, we grew very nicely. It's a great outstanding year for us for the IP business.
16% revenue year-over-year growth and pretty much across the board. I mean, clearly, the best of that
is the Tensilica, and we have a strong quarter and also the whole year, and expertly in the audio, imaging
and computer vision. And then the other part that we really like is their loyalty growth, very strong, and
especially in the audio side.

And I mentioned about the earbuds and also the smart speakers that we have a very strong footprint
there. And then the other part, the design IP also have a great year and across the board from DDR,
PCIe and then our newly acquired, not too long ago, the 112-gig SerDes, that is a must-have for all the
hyperscale guy and that infrastructure rollout, and that is for the AI, machine learning. And so we're
also delighted in that the marquee U.S. semiconductor company with us in the largest IP agreement we
have across different memory, Tensilica and the 112-gig SerDes. And to answer your question, it is all
organically developed and nothing from acquisition.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Great. And based on just the consumer component to that, would you expect that to continue to be more
heavily weighted to the third calendar quarter? Or is it too diversified to make that call?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Say again the question?

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Yes. I'm wondering if the IP -- if you expect from a seasonality point of view just for it to be largest in the
third calendar quarter? Or is it so diversified that it's tough to make that call?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. It's quite diversified. But yes, we went through a period back in 2016 where we refocused our IP and
went for profitable revenue growth. Right now, we're only guiding Q1 and the year. But certainly, IP has
been doing very, very well. We're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then to follow up, John, when you look at the margins on a quarterly basis, what's the biggest
determinant of the range? Is it product mix? Or is it with specific customer mix?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

It's probably more product mix. Of course, like the first part of the year, we're impacted by the purchase
accounting rules on the 2 acquisitions. In Q4, we'll get the benefit of that 53rd week.

Also, and probably -- right now, we probably should take a moment to acknowledge the dynamic situation
our employees and partners in China and the Asia Pacific region are navigating as health officials respond
to the coronavirus, our focus is on our employee safety, working with the authorities and dealing with the
crisis and on the potential business impact. Any impact of the coronavirus that we could quantify at this
time is in our guidance. But a large portion of our revenue, of course, is recurring in nature and the impact

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

we have seen to date is minimal and immaterial to our overall numbers. But anyway that impact is more
kind of front-loaded to the early part of the year.

Operator

Your next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Security.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Congratulations to a strong finish to the year and a strong start to this current year. I wanted to ask
about your backlog. If I read correctly that you cited a backlog increase of about 20% from the conclusion
of '19 versus 2018. Is that apples-to-apples comparison adjusting for the way you now count for IPAA
commitments?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Gary, yes. Backlog was $3.6 billion at year-end, which includes approximately $200 million of
noncancelable IP access agreements. That's up from $3 billion at the end of 2018, including $100 million
of IP access agreements. Now it's impacted by the timing of renewals. And our weighted average duration
for 2019 was slightly higher because we had a really, really strong Q4. That weighted average duration for
2019 was 2.7 years.

Now if I look at the average for 2018 and 2019 together, it was in the usual 2.4 to 2.6-year range. And if
I look at 2017 through 2019, that's also in our typical 2.4 to 2.6-year range. But Q4 was a strong quarter
for us, and it took the weighted average duration for 2019 up to 2.7 years.

As you know, IP is lumpier than software as is our hardware portion of functional verification, and that had
a slight impact also.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Okay. I appreciate that. I know you guys have always tried to manage the business, new projects,
acquisitions and whatnot, based on the Rule of 40, some of the revenue growth in the non-GAAP operating
margin, and you just concluded 2019 with about 41%. You're guiding for 2020 at 42% and I'm sure the
extra week has some impact on that. And so therefore, are you willing to step out of your prior long-term
margin guide of 30%? Or should we now as well also start to consider the Cadence business being a 10%
top line grower?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

So Gary, I don't think we gave a long-term margin target of 30% in the past. And you are right to point
out the Rule of 40. We kind of manage the businesses using a Rule of 40 metric. I think in 2018, if you
go back, we achieved, what is it, 10% revenue growth and 30% non-GAAP operating margin? In 2019,
now the year we just closed, we just did 9% and 32%, yes. So a combined 41% on the Rule of 40 metric.
But -- and for 2020 guidance, I think you'll see that it's approximately 10% for revenue growth and about
32.5% or in the range of 32% to 33% for non-GAAP operating margin. The piece that we've been focused
on is driving profitable revenue growth. And that's why I called out the -- that's what I was calling out the
impact in my prepared remarks of the amount of our revenue growth that's flowing through to our non-
GAAP operating income line.

I think if you take the combined impact of the 53rd week and the acquisitions. I mean combined, they add
about $60 million of revenue to our fiscal 2020, but the impact to operating income is slightly negative
in 2020, predominantly due to those purchase accounting, the purchase accounting impact on those
acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in the acquisitions, our guidance assumes this
approximately half of our revenue growth in 2020 flows through to operating income. So we're very happy
with where we are. But because we're adding so much incremental margin, you're seeing the operating

11

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

margin increase year-over-year. But there's no near-term ceiling that we can see because we have about
50% flow through to operating income, but we haven't put out a long-term target.

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. I think, Gary, I'll just add on to it. Basically, we continue to drive innovation, continue to delight the
customer with the best products, and then, meanwhile, drive the efficiency in terms of Rule of 40, and
then we'd like to print the numbers. So we continue to execute and deliver the result to the shareholders.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Last question on the cash. It looks like you repatriated some cash, a quite substantial amount. I'm
just curious what the reasoning behind that is.

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. As we're just preparing to complete the acquisitions, the 2 acquisitions we completed at the start of
the year. At year-end, worldwide cash totals just over $700 million, $705 million, of which about $400
million of that within the U.S.

Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.

Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division

An intermediate-term question and then a longer-term question. So the first question is, in the long
history of EDA, the requirements for applications engineers, or AEs, has typically been a pretty good
coincidental or a leading indicator of business conditions in EDA. In your case, starting in second half of
'18 and through the first half of last year, you significantly ramped up your additions there, obviously,
connected, I'm sure, to the U.S. marquee customer and others.

But now your openings there have tailed off. So the question is, have you largely filled much of your
requirements for AEs and you're now back to a more normal run rate of requirements for AEs? And maybe
just talk about your thinking on what is generally your second largest source of employment after R&D.
And then, secondly, a longer-term question on computational software, how is the company committing
resources or the organization to do that? Is there a dedicated group of structure within the company for
that? And then a technical question, but as a follow-up on that.

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. Good question, Jay. Let me try to answer, and then John will chip in.

First of all, we are not guiding our hiring plan. But clearly, the AE, we're always recruiting AE and add-on
AE when we have a clear signal for the customer to drive success proliferation. So -- and we continue to
drive efficiency. And so we look at a clearer balance in terms of the demand. And also, meanwhile, we also
drive the efficiency and see where we can really drive down the highest return for the shareholders. And
so we continue to monitoring that. And so based on the project required and also continue to monitoring
what the company commitment to us before we really rule out.

And in terms of the system analysis space, so clearly, customer interest in our product is very strong. We
want to proliferate this product and then build out our road map, and then along the way, we will augment
our needs for the existing team. But so far, we continue to hiring top R&D and FAE when we see them.
And we're very high bar. So we want to make sure that we pick the right one to really -- able to really
drive the efficiency and then to the whole system analysis market that we try to go after.

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And Jay, I mean, combinational software is kind of Cadence's core competence. We manage the
group across 5 different business groups -- or manage employees across 5 different business groups. And
I mean -- sorry, sorry. The -- yes, we manage the business, the employees, across 5 business groups.
We've got functional verification, the Digital IC Group, Custom IC, Silicon Package Board and IP. Yes. And
the -- like I say, we're happy with the way we're ramping up innovative products on the system analysis
side. I mean as Lip-Bu said, we had over 90 evaluations underway and more than 20 customers today.

Jay Vleeschhouwer
Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division

A technical follow-up on that. Thus far, at least with Clarity and Celsius, you're taking very much of a point
tool approach to computational software, at least for simulation and analysis, use cases. But when you
think about what customers do in simulation and engineering software more broadly, it seems to me that
you're also going to have to have some kind of a process or data management capability to unify across
the multiple solvers. So how do you envision going beyond just a point tool by point tool product strategy
towards a more comprehensive flow or process orientation?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. Good question, Jay. I think first of all, when you started, you had to address the point tool solution
and then drive the best point tool solution. And then over time, then you have an integrated platform
able to drive the platform strategy, [ Liberate, ] our digital implementation, we start with our place and
route Innovus first, then we start with -- then the synthesis tool like Genus, then you have the Pegasus.
And then along the way, then you can really push for the whole platform. And then same thing as our
verification suite, we do that.

So this is just a beginning, as I mentioned earlier. This is the initial move in. And then along the way,
we have a plan of the other product lines and also through acquisitions so that we can really creating a
platform that we can marching forward as a full-court press.

And so right now, we are taking very calculated and then addressing the tool that the big TAM market is
$700 million, we can go after. Then over that, and now we have our game plan while developing various
other tool, and stay tuned. And over time, we will unfold it and then create a platform, and then we can
put the platform like our digital and verification.

Your next question comes from Jackson Ader with JPMorgan.

Jackson Edmund Ader
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

First one, just on the impacts in China from the virus. How are those impacts? I know, John, you
mentioned they were minimal, but how are they actually manifesting themselves? Are orders being
delayed? Are conversations being delayed? Or are the conversations like you mentioned about the safety
of your employees? Are the conversations just not focused on business at the moment?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. So let me start, and then John can chip in. So first of all, we acknowledge the dynamic situation our
employee and partners in China and Asia Pacific, and we navigate through carefully. We are monitoring
carefully also. And then with health official and then make sure that we respond to that coronavirus.
And then, meanwhile, the first priority is really focused on our employee safety, and then working with
authority to deal with the crisis. And then Wuhan and also -- this week, a lot of people coming back to
work. And then how it's going to be impacting, we're getting closing on the monitoring on the supply chain

and also the whole factory reopen and so at a different stage. And good news is, our revenue is recurring
in nature. And then, meanwhile, we're also monitoring the situation, check with all our key customer and
partner. And so far, that we already built into our whatever we forecast in the budget. And clearly, the
impact is minimum and immaterial overall number. And that's what John has highlighted his assumption
that we see, and we're closely monitoring so far.

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Jackson, I mean, we're closely monitoring the situation. In terms of what we've seen so far is, we're
picking up some extra expenses as we try to support our customers from remote regions that we're
paying some people over time. We have -- some of our revenue comes from royalties. We've ratcheted
down our expectations of royalty revenue in Q1 because some of that royalty revenue comes out of China
and Asia Pacific.

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

And/or is it included in the guidance?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Everything is in our guidance.

Jackson Edmund Ader
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

All right. Great. That's helpful. And then a more broad question on Clarity and Celsius, or really just 3D
solvers in general. Is there any reason or is there anything structural that you see in terms of the margin
profile that would be different from your core EDA business relative to the 3D solver market?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. I think, clearly, the system analysis space is a good market, is a good business. And we, again,
mentioned it's very early in the game. And we continue to driving the opportunity and proliferating with
our customer. And I think the market is ready, and a lot of our customer request that.

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The profile is -- the profitability profile is very similar to EDA. And it's probably -- our entry into
system analysis is probably one of our drivers of increased op margin. I think if you look at our gross
margin for 2018, it was 90%. In 2019, we achieved 90.6%. And in our guidance, we're targeting 91%
because of the growth we're seeing and because of all the evaluations that are underway on the system
analysis space.

Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

John, I just want to go back to the acquisitions and maybe understand a little bit better the impact they're
having on op margins in the March quarter. And I appreciate that you've talked about the impact kind
of diminishing throughout the year. But what kind of exit run rate should we think about on op margins
relative to the acquisitions influences?

John M. Wall

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

Right. So like you say, it combines the 2 acquisitions, add about $20 million of revenue in 2020. And they
are dilutive to earnings in 2020. I think if you look at the impact on the purchase accounting, it's kind of
heavily weighted toward the first quarter, and it kind of -- it bleeds off kind of as we go through each of
the 4 quarters. There's still a little bit that bleeds into 2021, but we expect to be accretive in 2021.

Another driver -- sorry, just another driver of the op margin profile for Q1 is that I do want to kind of
remind you that we've grown headcount significantly. During 2019, we entered 2019 with less than 7,500
employees. We were up to 8,078. So up about 8% in the headcount by the end of 2019 as we're investing
in proliferation with market shaping customers and these TAM expansion opportunities.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then maybe as my follow-on, I'm kind of curious, when you think about the organic
growth for 2020, especially kind of in the core EDA business, how should we think about kind of share
gains that traditional customers versus sort of growth in new applications and new customers around AI?
And I'd be curious as you answer the question, clearly, M&A has been a key theme in semis over the last
kind of 5 to 8 years, and I presume as larger companies bought smaller companies, they perhaps had
better pricing on EDA tools just by a function of scale. I'm curious if you look back over time, whether or
not that was a meaningful headwind to revenue growth, and now that a lot of the big M&A is probably
behind us, how -- does that become sort of a tailwind to revenue growth?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. John, it's a good question. First of all, I'm excited about this industry because very unusual to have
5 major waves happening at the same time. You have the AI machine learning wave, and you have 5G
is starting to deploy, and then you have the hyperscale guy, the really massively scaled infrastructure.
And then we have autonomous driving, and then the whole digital transformation of the industry group.
And then as I mentioned earlier, clearly, some of this big system company and a service provider, they
are quietly building up the silicon capability. They're also reaching out to us to really expand beyond that
to the system analysis space. And so I think we are excited about the opportunity in front of us. And
so, so far, I think the core EDA, I think the proliferation from the leading customer, we still have a lot of
opportunity in front of us, and we are very excited to pursue aggressively on that in terms of share gain.
And then the other part is clearly some of the new product that we are launching now. And I should -- you
will recall that one of the big strategy for Cadence is to driving the innovation.

So we have -- last year, we have 7 new organically developed products. Beside those system analysis
tool, we have the Protium X1, we have Spectre X product, and then we have the Jasper Smart Gold and
CloudBurst. And by the way, some of the new product, we tried to move into the cloud. We take the
leadership in the cloud and then basically, cloud-native tool that really drive the performance and the
scalability for our customer, and they love it. And so I think in terms of pricing-wise, our value, about the
value, we don't want to price it, and then we really drive quality, and we want to be the trusted partner for
the customer. They can count on us to really drive the performance. And then in return, we get the value
that we won. And when you move down to 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer that's -- we have become very
important to them, to drive some of this design success and then we're excited to be partner in supporting
them.

Your next question comes from Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America.

Adam Gonzalez
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

First, I just wanted to take a step back and you're talking about this $5 billion market opportunity in
system analysis. But I think in the past, you've talked about a $30 billion market versus the $10 billion
market you serve, and that's inclusive of EDA, IP. Can you help me reconcile the difference between the

CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 12, 2020

$10 billion EDA and IP market you serve plus the $5 billion system analysis market? How are you guys
getting the $30 billion? What am I missing?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Sure. So let me just draw the picture for you. Besides the -- we have this, we call it, Intelligent System
Design strategy, the first layer on the ground floor is, we call it, the design excellence. That is a core EDA
and IP. There's still a lot of room to grow in terms of proliferation of products, especially some of the
innovating products that we are really driving. And then, secondly, we are moving into the next level, you
call the system and innovation. In terms of system analysis, and it's just a portion of it. And then you
have embedded software security, that is overlay on that. And then the third layer is, we call it pervasive
intelligence. And as we are applying the AI algorithm know-how to really address our core business and
also some of the specific vertical that we are going after, and then that total together is basically from the
$10 billion from the design excellence, that's 2 other layers that will add up another $20 billion to really
drive some of the vertical markets that we are serving in the next 5 years.

Adam Gonzalez
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. Next 5 years. Got it. And then following up on Clarity and Celsius, good job with the cost
momentum you've built so far. Can you give me an overview or give us an overview of the competitive
landscape and what your differentiators are there? And in that $700 million TAM that you're addressing so
far, is there a next point tool solution or market that you're looking to target, perhaps, in the near future?

Lip-Bu Tan
CEO & Director

Yes. So I think we mentioned earlier about this $5 billion TAM market. Initially, we target on that $700
million. That is in the EM solver and also the thermal co-simulation area. And then we are quietly building
some other products. And stay tuned, when we are ready, we will launch that. And so initially, we cannot
get a few, we call it the low-hanging fruit, clearly drive the computation software differentiation that we
can show 10x performance. We're excited to validate that with 90 evaluation and 20 customers signed up.
And more is coming. So we will keep you updated on that. Clearly, I think people see the performance of
10x performance, and they can really have that performance driven and they are excited to see that --
they want to get the best tool. And then over time, they're going to tell us what are the new tool we had
to go in and we're going to build and acquire, and then build up the platform to really drive the success in
that system analysis. And again, I say that this is just the beginning. And so we're in the early inning.

Your last question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.

Thomas Robert Diffely
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Just a quick follow-up. John, when you look at the 53-week year, does that have a bigger impact on your
cost structure than it will on revenues?

John M. Wall
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So essentially, the -- if you look at the 53rd week, it's a holiday week kind of between Christmas
and New year, it adds about $40 million to annual revenue because it's really the recurring piece of our
revenue that is daily subscription-based that we get the extra revenue for. But for -- on the expense side,
we kind of pick up the full week of expenses.

So the upside to operating income is minimal for that 53rd week.
