Presentation

Operator

Hello, my name is Pasha. I will be your conference facilitator this afternoon. At this time, I would like
to welcome everyone to Fortive Corporation's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Griffin Whitney, Vice President of
Investor Relations. Mr. Whitney, you may begin your conference.

Griffin Whitney
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Pasha. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. With us today are
Jim Lico, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck McLaughlin, our Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer.

We present certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. Information required by SEC Regulation
G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website,
www.fortive.com, under the heading Investors/ Quarterly Results.

We completed the separation of our prior Industrial Technologies segment through the spin-off of Vontier
Corporation on October 9, 2020. And have accordingly included the results of the Industrial Technologies
segment as discontinued operations. The results presented on this call are based on continuing operations.

During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-
year performance. All references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-
over-year on a continuing operations basis.

During the call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal
securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate
will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make
today.

Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-
looking statements is available in our SEC filings including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are
made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'd like
to turn the call over to Jim.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. We were very pleased with our second quarter results.
As you can see on Slide 3, our performance once again highlighted the benefits of our strategy to
provide differentiated connected workflow solutions for our customers, creating a portfolio with enhanced
resilience and long-term earnings power.

During the quarter, we capitalized on accelerating point-of-sale trends across a number of our larger
businesses, continued growth from our software offerings and improving conditions across our key end
markets. Against this backdrop, we delivered core revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margins
that exceeded the high end of our guidance, driving exceptional earnings growth and free cash flow
conversion.

As we highlighted at our Investor Day on May 19, we are building on the foundation of our advantaged
hardware positions and expanding our software capabilities to address our customers' critical workflow
needs and accelerate their ongoing digital transformation.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

In the second quarter, our SaaS offerings delivered low double-digit growth, and we also drove significant
improvement across our professional services offerings. We continue to see strong momentum at eMaint,
including increasing demand from its expansion into the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and health
care verticals. Gordian and Accruent both had strong quarters as they executed on opportunities provided
by increasing demand from facility owner operators and improvements in access to customer sites.

Both companies are well positioned to capitalize as customers focused on post-COVID return to work
challenges and digital transformation priorities. Censis also performed very well in the quarter as access to
hospital customers improved, executing on strong demand for its SaaS offerings among existing and new
independent delivery network customers.

Looking across the portfolio, we continue to be excited about our expanding offering of EHS workflow
solutions, which are well positioned to meet the significant long-term sustainability requirements of our
customers. ISC and Intelex performed well, capitalizing on strong broad-based growth across end markets
in key geographies.

At the same time, we are excited with the early progress at ehsAI where the company closed its largest
deal to date in its first joint marketing campaign with Intelex and generated strong growth in its sales
pipeline. Throughout the second quarter, we continue to apply the Fortive Business System across the
portfolio to drive innovation, growth and share gains.

Deployment of our lean portfolio management tool set, which significantly accelerates the efficiency and
impact of R&D investments achieved a greater than 40% increase in our on-time program delivery. The
application of FBS and digital analytics and search optimization generated 25% growth in digital traffic
from pre-pandemic levels across the portfolio. Meanwhile, the use of FBS growth tools has accelerated
innovation at Fluke Health Solutions over the past 18 months and continues to drive excellent top line
performance.

We have created good early momentum in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs including the recent
spin-in of TeamSense, a provider of innovative workflow solutions to streamline communications with
hourly workers. This marks the first business incubated at Pioneer Square Labs to be integrated into the
Fortive portfolio.

While still very early, we are pleased with the progress thus far at TeamSense and are excited to develop
additional technologies that accelerate safety and productivity solutions for customers within our core
markets.

In early July, we announced the acquisition of ServiceChannel. The transaction brings a differentiated
high-growth software business with an integrated service provider network and significant proprietary
data assets to the portfolio, enhancing our ability to meet the evolving needs of facility owners around the
world.

Following the expected closing of the acquisition in Q3, we will have significant balance sheet capacity
supported by our strong and resilient free cash flow generation. As we highlighted at our Investor Day, we
see substantial runway across our $40 billion served market for disciplined capital allocation to accelerate
our strategy.

Turning to a quick summary of the results in the quarter on Slide 4. We generated year-over-year total
revenue growth of 26.7% as revenue strength exceeded the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating
margin was 22.2%, while adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, representing a year-over-year increase
of 53.5%. Given the outperformance for both top line and our adjusted operating margin we delivered
$282 million of free cash flow, which represented 118% conversion of adjusted net income.

On Slide 5, we take a closer look at the Intelligent Operating Solutions segment. iOS posted total revenue
growth of 31.2% in the second quarter. This included mid-20% core growth in North America, low 30%
core growth in Western Europe and low 20% core growth in China.

Fluke's core revenue increased in the mid-30% range. Fluke also grew by mid-single digits on a sequential
basis as I continue to see robust demand across its businesses, highlighted by growth at Fluke Industrial.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Fluke Industrial generated share gains across a range of key channel partners and retail accounts as point-
of-sale accelerated through the quarter.

Fluke's broader II900 acoustic imaging product line also continues to perform very well as revenue
approximately doubled in the quarter on strong growth across both Western Europe and North America.

Fluke Networks also performed well, driven by the recent launch of its LinkIQ product line which continues
to exceed initial expectations tied to office reopenings and network modifications.

In Fluke Reliability, our efforts to accelerate performance at Pruftechnik are gaining traction as we took
advantage of increasing demand for alignment and other services, while eMaint also delivered another
strong quarter. With the accelerated pace of orders at Fluke, we did see some backlog build due to supply
chain responsiveness.

Industrial Scientific increased by mid-teens, driven by strong execution in instruments and rental as
demand from oil and gas markets rebounded and the business continued its expansion into new end
markets. The company's iNet offering remained resilient, increasing by mid-single digits with net retention
solidly above 100%.

Intelex grew by high single digits in Q2, reporting a record revenue quarter. Intelex continues to leverage
FBS and has driven improvements in lead generation and funnel conversion. Also in the second quarter,
Intelex closed multiple deals for its enhanced ESG platform to help customers launch, scale and optimize
their sustainability programs and meet increasing demand for transparency on a growing set of critical
nonfinancial reporting metrics.

Accruent grew by mid-single digits in the second quarter with low double-digit growth in its SaaS
business. Accruent generated strong sales and bookings for its Meridian solution for engineering document
management and its maintenance connection, CMMS offerings. The business also capitalized on the strong
demand for its EMS event, workspace and resource scheduling offerings as companies plan and execute
their return-to-work strategies.

The company continues to generate new customer logo wins and improving growth in recurring bookings.
Importantly, Accruent also delivered improved performance in its professional service business, which
generated mid-single-digit growth as customer site access continued to improve.

Gordian increased by mid-teens, driven by low 20% growth in the procurement business and high
teens growth in estimating. Gordian generated a record month for procurement revenue in June with
accelerating time lines for key projects across a number of large customers. This included increased
project spend by the New York City Department of Education and School Construction Authority.

Moving to Slide 6. Precision Technologies segment posted a total revenue increase of 25.1% in the second
quarter. This included low 20% growth in North America, mid-20% growth in Western Europe and mid-
teens growth in China.

Tektronix increased by approximately 30%, with another quarter of strong demand across its product
businesses, including accelerating point-of-sale trends in each of its major regions. Both mainstream
and performance oscilloscopes had a strong quarter with high demand for semiconductor, industrial
manufacturing and communications applications.

Tektronix service business again showed its stability and resilience increasing by low teens. Tektronix
continues to benefit from the accelerated focus on driving innovation with Q2 new product introductions
performing very well, including its family of automated test solutions for high-speed data transfer.

In the second quarter, Tektronix held 6 regional innovation form events, which stimulated the adoption of
its TekScope platform, resulting in accelerated funnel creation for the company's broader hardware and
software offerings.

Sensing Technologies increased by low teens in the second quarter with growth driven by continuation
of the broad market recovery. Sensing performed very well in China with another quarter of mid-teens
growth, driven by demand for factory automation solutions.

Hengstler, Anderson-Negele continues to make progress with its approval of its paperless process recorder
IoT solution aimed at the dairy industry with broader commercial rollout expected in the second half of the
year. Sensing also continues to drive market share gains -- Hengstler across its portfolio, particularly at
Setra, led by its differentiated critical environment solution and strong demand across its HVAC customers.

PacSci EMC grew in the low 20% range, with the business seeing some alleviation of the COVID-related
shutdowns and approval delays that impacted shipments in previous quarters. PacSci EMC continues to
see good growth in the commercial space market with the resumption of launches by OneWeb providing
recurring revenue for smart controllers and initiators.

Also on July 20, we were excited to watch the company's mission-critical technology, ensure safe and
reliable separation of Blue Origin's New Shepherd capsule from its booster during its maiden voyage.

Moving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions on Slide 7. Total revenue increased 21.8%, including 11% core
growth. This included high single-digit core growth in each of North America, Western Europe and China
markets. ASP grew by high single digits in the second quarter, led by strong growth in Western Europe and
China. ASP also realized improved growth in North America, highlighted by high single-digit growth in the
U.S.

Overall, ASP grew its consumable revenue high teens as the rate of elective procedures across most
geographies continue to improve. While elective procedure volumes increased on a year-over-year basis,
Q2 volumes came in a bit lower than expected at approximately 93% of pre-COVID levels, which was
consistent with the Q1 exit rate.

ASP also continued to expand its global installed base of terminal sterilization capital equipment, which
grew at a 3.5% annualized rate in Q2. We expect this continued installed base expansion to provide an
additional tailwind to consumable revenue as procedure volumes normalize going forward.

Censis increased in the mid-20% range with mid-teens growth in its CensiTrac SaaS offering as well as
strong growth in its professional services business. Many hospital customers are now allowing access
to vendors which resulted in a significant increase in activity in the second quarter, particularly with
integrated delivery networks.

Fluke Health Solutions increased by low double digits even as it lapped a sizable COVID-related revenue
tailwind in the prior year. FHS saw high-teens growth from its OPTIMIZE and OneQA software solutions,
which benefited from accelerated growth investments over the last 18 months.

With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through some additional details on our margins, free
cash flow and balance sheet.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid margin performance in Q2 and driven
primarily by strong fall-through and our revenue out-performance. Adjusted gross margins were 57.3%,
up 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This increase reflected 130 basis points of price realization
as we delivered another quarter of solid performance managing price cost across the portfolio.

Q2 adjusted operating profit margin was 22.2%, 170 basis points above the high end of our guidance,
also driven by stronger volume and high associated fall-through. We reported 240 basis points of core
operating margin expansion, including 570 basis points of core OMX at the iOS segment.

Both Fluke and Tektronix delivered strong core operating margin expansion through disciplined option
of FBS to drive sales conversion as demand accelerated across their end markets. At the same time,
strong contributions from some of the acquired pieces of our portfolio, including ISC, Gordian, Censis and
Landauer also contributed to the margin outperformance across the segments.

On Slide 8, you can see that in the second quarter, we generated $282 million of free cash flow,
representing a 118% conversion of adjusted net income. Free cash flow over the trailing 12 months
increased 15% to $943 million.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Today, our net leverage is approximately 1x, and we expect net leverage to be around 1.2x at year-end,
including the funding of the acquisition of ServiceChannel, but excluding any additional M&A. This gives us
significant capacity to continue to deploy towards our key capital allocation priorities.

Turning now to the guide on Slide 9. Given the strong performance in the second quarter and the
improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are once again raising our 2021 guidance.

For the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.65 to $2.75,
representing a year-over-year growth of 27% to 32% on a continuing operations basis. This assumes total
revenue growth of 13.5% to 15%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22.5% to 23.5%, and an effective
tax rate of 14% to 14.5%. It also assumes total revenue growth of 8.5% to 11% in the second half of
2021.

We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for
the full year. We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.62 to
$0.66, representing year-over-year growth of 24% to 32%. This assumes total revenue growth of 11.5%
to 14.5%, adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5% to 22.5% and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%.

For the third quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net
income.

With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Chuck. Before I move to questions, I want to provide a quick update on our sustainability and
inclusion and diversity efforts, which is shown on Slide 11.

During our Investor Day program on May 19, we introduced an accelerated greenhouse gas reduction
goal, which now targets a reduction of 50% in greenhouse gas intensity for Scope 1 and Scope 2
emissions by 2025 relative to our 2017 base year.

During the second quarter, we also issued our 2021 Sustainability Report, which included Fortive's second
annual GRI index, first annual SASB index and the 2017 to 2020 greenhouse gas emissions profile.

During the quarter, we also became a signatory to the UN Global Compact, committed to alignment with
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure by 2022 and announced our 2025 aspirational
inclusion and diversity goals. We continue to make significant strides and are highly committed to
accelerating our sustainability and inclusion and diversity progress in the coming years.

I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank our team and all of our stakeholders for your support over
the first 5 years of our journey as an independent company. Across all 3 of our strategic segments, we are
expanding on strong established positions with offerings that address the critical workflow needs of our
customers and markets with attractive long-term growth drivers.

Our strong earnings and free cash flow performance in the first half of this year clearly demonstrated
the benefits of this strategic focus and the momentum building in our portfolio. As we look ahead, we
will continue to invest and expanding the capabilities of the Fortive Business System as we accelerate
operating improvements and innovation to increase the value we offer to our customers.

With strong free cash flow and significant M&A capacity we are well positioned to pursue the key organic
and inorganic growth initiatives that will drive consistent double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth
in the years to come.

With that, I'll turn it back to Griffin.

Griffin Whitney
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Jim. That concludes our formal comments. Pasha, we are now ready for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Just a question on the AHS margin. I think the fourth quarter, just backing into kind of the fourth quarter
guidance shows margins that are kind of into the like beyond the mid-20s in the kind of even the high 20s,
maybe just some rounding going on there, but at kind of the high end of the range, what's implied. Am I
looking at that the right way? And what's kind of the source of that strength, if so?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Steve. That's a good question. And I think you're calculating it right above the mid-20s pushing
around 27% -- 26%, 27%, I think, is the right zone. What's pushing is that is, as we move through time,
we're starting to see -- we'll see acceleration in our revenue as elective surgeries get better. But also
seasonally, there is more revenue in the fourth quarter, and you put those 2 things together, and that's
what really drives the health margins at the segment level up.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

So is that any read, I guess, is that any read into next year? Or is it like highly unusual seasonality -- like
the fourth quarter is just way stronger than the rest? I mean, is there a reason why that like -- why that
seasonality is so acute? Or can we think about that as maybe a bit of a jumping off point at some stage?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

I don't think from just where the OP is going to be is it's a jumping off point. But I do think in terms of
every year, you should expect the fourth quarter to be stronger. But we have the back half of the year
going up by a couple of hundred basis points in each of the quarters. And I think -- I don't think that
there's anything anomalous about this Q4 going forward, but I wouldn't take that and multiply it by 4.
I think we're going to go back to a couple of hundred basis points of growth in Q1 and Q2 and what we
posted this year.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Steve, I'd just add that like last year, we sort of have that 25% as an exit rate not saying it was going to
be the rate for every quarter, but that would be a good jumping off point in which to take margins to the
next level. I think you're seeing that the same thing. I think it's a combination of the FBS work, the full
year effect of the FBS work, the full year effect of all the work that we're doing to continue to integrate the
business, drive margins. And as Chuck said, consumable revenue coming up to as well. So I just think the
business is in a good trajectory right now overall. And obviously, a big part of that is ASP.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Right. That makes a lot of sense. And just one follow-up on the margin for the total company. Did you
ultimately have some of that cost come back? I think we were thinking of it in kind of the $75 million
range, like temporary costs and then some of those investments that hit this quarter year-over-year. I
mean, did you guys ultimately see that stuff come through?

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Senior VP & CFO

We did. There's 2 things going on. For Q2, there was the year-over-year we had $60 million of snapback
cost. We did that. And then plus we did another $15 million in investments, and that did show up in Q2 for
sure.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. So that's like a core incremental on EBITA of like, I don't know, I can back into something like 65%,
70% kind of core incremental. I mean, is that the right kind of math?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Well, it is. So the straight year-over-year incrementals for Q2 is 31%, stronger than the mid-20s we talked
about. But yes, with our incremental gross margins are going to be in that 65% range. So yes, that is
the right math. I wouldn't expect that to fall through at that every quarter. In the second half, we would
expect as we've been talking about 40% is the right thing for the second half we have going forward.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Jim or Chuck, could you follow up a little bit on the -- just kind of the POS comments? And I don't know
if you have to kind of break it down to Fluke and a couple of other businesses. But are the sales we're
observing here in the quarter, trailing or outpacing POS?

And I just wonder if you have any color on what's going on with channel inventories if the channels in any
way caught up or this is a pretty good indication of what end demand is?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We saw one of the things, Jeff, is obviously with the beat in revenue and the strength that we saw,
particularly as it accelerated through the quarter, point of sale is an important target as you're asking,
you're exactly right. We saw good POS that continue to improve through the quarter, I think it will
continue to improve.

Obviously, a little bit of an easier comp in the quarter, but both at Fluke and at Tek, we saw -- as an
example in POS in the Americas, we saw in the 30% range. So better than our -- even than our sales --
total sales in some cases. So a very good position.

We're starting to -- we're also obviously making sure given supply chain discussions around the world,
we're making sure that inventories aren't up that we're not seeing accelerated buying. We're doing --
we're using a new metric where we not only look at point of sale, but we also look at orders on hand to
sort of understand are we seeing a leading-in situation or not. And we're certainly seeing things continue
to be good.

So hence, we took the revenue guide up, both Fluke and Tek are performing well, and I think we're in a
good place. And we're certainly -- particularly in the U.S. and Europe, where we have the best data, we're
certainly at a good place from an inventory position. We don't feel like we're in any situation. building
excessive inventory.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

And I wonder if you could just take a moment on tech in particular and discuss what's going on in some
of the new verticals you are trying to pursue. I think as going to be an important part of making sure Tek
puts up the kind of growth you want to see over time, not just in the cyclical rebound. So where are we
at on that push? Some of these new verticals, maybe some color on what percent of tech sales these are
now and how you see those progressing?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think it's because we're feeling -- as we said in the first quarter commentary and again this time, we
are seeing automotive data centers as 2 particular verticals that have continued to increase. I think on a
percentage basis, they're about the same, simply because the total revenue is coming up. And obviously,
in places like Keithley, we still continue to see revenue in semiconductor. So I don't think we've necessarily
moved the needle as a percent of sales. But on a total basis in terms of total dollars, we're certainly up.

And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the advent of TekScope which is sort of a software
offering is also, I think, helps users connect multiple scopes and multiple channels and really bring more
data together is also accelerated in some new verticals as well. So I think just to answer your question
specifically, I don't think we've seen a demonstrative difference necessarily in the percent of sales, but we
have seen substantially greater sales in those verticals over time. And that should bode well for the future.

Operator

Our next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.

Scott Reed Davis
Melius Research LLC

A couple of things here. I mean, first of all, I mean, we -- obviously, you're getting operating leverage,
but is price kind of in line with your cost increases? Are you still catching up a little bit on that? Or another
way to say it is we're 130 bps up on price, is that accelerating with -- through the year here?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We're in great shape on price/cost, Scott. First of all, as you said, 130 bps in the quarter we'll --
in the hardware businesses, in particular, we'll double that number in the second half. So we're in a
very good position relative to price. As you know, we've gotten good price over the years. So this is a
compounding effect. You saw those price read through as well on the gross margin improvement in the
second quarter. So we feel very good.

And really, quite frankly, even though we are seeing a little bit of cost inflation, we're still going to be
net -- significantly net in a good shape relative to material cost reductions for the year. So material cost
reductions will still be profit improver for the year, even though we've seen a little bit more inflation than
typical, we still are in a very good shape relative to price cost, not only because of price, but also because
we've done a nice job on the cost reduction side as well.

Okay. That's super helpful. And then this is a little nitty gritty, but just following up on Jeff's question on
Tek and oscilloscopes, overall. I mean, the new markets that you're entering is it with the same exact
product, meaning kind of standardized product just different channel? Or do they have different problems,
they're trying to solve in electric vehicle facility or data center that perhaps you've modified or changing or
creating new products for?

Yes. I would say on balance, they're the same base oscilloscopes, the 6 series or the 4 series, but then
there's a set of software that's specific to that vertical application. There might be a set of probes that
is also different. And ultimately, there's really a solution around the challenges that they might have. As
an example, power usage is a huge issue in data centers. It's a big problem. And in electric vehicles in
a variety of places. So it might be a power consumption challenge, maybe trying to do some different
troubleshooting aspects of particular applications as well. So there's a suite of software and probes that
typically go with that oscilloscope that is very much vertical specific.

Your next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Yes, I'll just continue to ask questions about Tek. It does sound like very broad-based demand in
Tektronix. How durable do you think the demand is here versus sort of more bounce back from COVID?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, there's certainly an aspect of the bounce back at COVID. So I wouldn't, in any way, shape or form,
take away from that. But I think when you look at where the business has been historically, we're at an
accelerated growth rate here over the last couple of years.

So I think in that sense, we feel good about the overall growth rate this year. And we think it's certainly
durable in the sense of services. As we recognize, services had a good quarter. We're doing some good
strategic work to add to services, the things we were just mentioning around new verticals. So the team
has really got the mantra and the strategy to consider -- to continue to make the business less volatile,
less cyclical and really work towards some secular drivers that have more durable growth rate. And I think
we're in a very good position relative to how we'll do that over time.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Securities, Research Division

And a follow-up. So how should we think about the implications around the uptick in professional services
and improving site access for your SaaS businesses? Site access was a hurdle from your logos, right? But
just trying to get a sense if now you're able to close deals and start onboarding new clients?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes, we're still not where we'd like to be. So -- and obviously, even the recent news as of the last 24 hours
is going to have -- we'll have to look into. But I think we feel confident in sort of double-digit professional
services growth in our SaaS businesses in the second half. So we see continued improvement Insight
access. We're starting to see customers start to really make decisions here at an accelerated rate. Talk a
little bit about that in the prepared remarks amongst all the software businesses.

So yes, I think you'd say the second half, we're in a much better place relative to services. And that's not
just on-site services, it's also getting customers to accept remote services. So it's a combination of the
good work the team has done to be able to deliver things more remotely as well as customer site access.

Wolfe Research, LLC

So just in answer to Jeff's question, I'm not sure if you actually addressed the absolute level of channel
inventories to your best sort of knowledge. And the sort of the question is that obviously, a lot of channels

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

are pretty empty at this point. So any sense on where channel inventories are for Tek and Fluke and other
products?

And then kind of on top of that, it sounds like a dumb question given the kind of call you just put up, but
did supply chain constraints gate your ability to supply during the quarter?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So first, I think we're in a good place in channel inventories. I think in some cases, given the revenue
numbers, both what we delivered in the quarter, over delivered in the quarter, plus raising the guides
for the full year. You'd say, well, we're definitely seeing better demand. And in the back -- against that
backdrop, we're not seeing increase in channel inventories nor would we see an increase in channel
inventories, at least in the next 90 days through delivering the revenue that we have relative to the POS
numbers we're seeing.

So I think we feel good about end user demand, and we feel good about the fact that we're not building
inventory in some sort of oversaturation situation. So I think there's real demand out there, and I think
we're fulfilling it.

Nigel, we're not oblivious in any way, shape or form, like our peers and other companies -- pretty much all
the companies in the world relative to supply chain constraints, we've seen those for sure. I think the fact
that we've been building great lean manufacturing capability over decades in our businesses, our ability to
respond to those things relative to the FBS tools like daily management and problem solving means we're
fighting every day to secure material.

And our ability to beat the revenue in the second quarter is a good demonstration of our success in that
way. But I would also say we continue to see those challenges every day, and I would expect to see those
challenges probably through the year at least. So I think we're in a -- we've been very successful thus far,
but it is a daily battle. But given the work we've done over decades to build the kind of capability within
our factories, I like our chances and continuing to be successful.

Nigel Edward Coe
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. That's great news. And then I wanted to go back quickly to ASP margins -- sorry, AHS margins.
A little bit weaker, lighter in the quarter 2Q. Is that simply the mix of ASP? Does ASP carry a high
contribution margin relative to the average there? And then that 27% margin -- your guidance for 4Q,
does that represent "normal mix" in that segment?

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks for the question, Nigel. So it's -- we really weren't lighter than what we expected. We're over the
high end of our guide for Q2 on AHS margins, but I think you're looking at the comparison to last year And
so there's a couple of things going on there. One, as we have been building out our supply chain coming
off the TSAs, that's incrementally put in starting last year at this time, more cost. So when you come back
to the margins, that gives us a headwind on year-over-year margins. With that, there's a little bit higher
freight as well. But there's more revenue to go along with it. So we're still driving OP.

Also, we had a one-timer last year that inflated margins, that doesn't repeat this year, related to just
the transition of the TSAs. But again, I think that we're right where we expected to be in Q2. And going
forward, you're going to see us start expanding again double -- like 200 basis points from Q2 to Q3. And
then Q3 to Q4, maybe even a little bit more than that. So consistent margin expansion. And yes, the
consumables have very high margins. And so as recovery that really helps part of that story for sure.

FORTIVE CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 29, 2021

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe just the first question around the, I think the AHS margins have been discussed a fair amount, but
just wanted to touch on the revenue side of things. You took down the high end of the core growth guide
for AHS for this year, kept the margins, as you said. So maybe help us understand what the -- what's
driving that revenue reduction? And how good you feel about the overall state of businesses such as ASP
in terms of their market share? And are they winning sort of their fair share of business?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Julian, I'll take the second one first. I think our installed base is up 3.5% year-on-year. We're in a
very good place relative to equipment placements. We had another good equipment quarter after several
4, 5 quarters in a row of continued increases in the installed base. So we feel very good about where we
stand relative to the installed base.

I think what we're really saying for the second half of the year. And I think if you look consistent revenue
through growth through the remaining part of the year, ASP will actually accelerate in growth through the
remaining part of the year. But we did see a little bit of elective procedures coming down a little bit than
we anticipated. As we said, we thought maybe we would end the quarter around 95%. We ended around
93%. So there's a little bit of an assumption that we'll probably not get to 100% by the end of the year,
that has a little bit of impact.

But I think we come back to the fact that we're taking share. And if things come back, we certainly would
see and associated improvement. But I think we're just trying to be a little bit more consistent with what
we've seen here recently relative to elective procedures.

And so there's a little bit of a change. Obviously, we took the guide up and total up for the overall
company, but a little bit -- maybe a little bit more conservative relative to where we think elective
procedures might come in. And as you said, continued very strong margin increases like Chuck was just
describing through the remaining part of the year through AHS and at ASP. Sorry for all the acronyms.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

No worries. And just on China, I think your growth went from close to 30% in Q1 to sort of mid-teens
in the second quarter. So pretty consistent with a lot of the other indicators, short cycle-wise in recent
months there. But when you're looking at sort of Fluke and Tektronix in China, both have a very good
presence there. How are you thinking about their growth in the second half in China specifically?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think very good. I think the answer is to be quick. We -- Chuck and I did a review with all the China
teams here a few days ago and feel very good about the second half, particularly at Fluke and Tek. The
comps play a little bit of a role here. And so -- but I think as we look on a 2-year stack as an example,
we continue to grow well in China through the remaining part of the year. So I think we've got mid-teens
or something like that for the full year in China. And we feel good that we can continue to maintain good
growth rates and really good market positions as we get into 2022 as well.

Markus M. H. Mittermaier

Very quick follow-up on pricing. The 130 basis points that you have, you said the target is to double that
in the second half. Just to be clear, that's part of the guide? Or should we add that on top?

James A. Lico

Yes, Markus, I was -- the 200 and some basis points is really in our hardware businesses, particularly
sort of Fluke-Tek, Sensing Tech in particular, that I would associate it with that number. So that's really a
comparison of where really relative to price cost.

I think our overall -- sort of our overall pricing for all of Fortive incorporating everything is probably closer
to -- from the second quarter, probably up about 140 -- excuse me, about 40 or 50 basis points up from
where we've been thus far in the first half. So the 200 is really to address the price cost question. And so
-- but the overall pricing is a little bit less than that.

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

And we have a built that into our guide.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

And that's built into the guide, yes, thanks.

Markus M. H. Mittermaier
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. Okay. No, that makes sense because then the follow-up would have been sort of if you see any sort of
issues around price elasticity, that doesn't sound like it. And then...

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Go ahead, sorry.

Markus M. H. Mittermaier
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Yes. And then the second question around just the balance sheet. Of the ServiceChannel now, I think any
change in priorities. I know that a few months ago, you said obviously, relative size between the various
businesses matters. Any sort of new thinking here where priorities are here for the second half of the
year?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

No. I think as we said in the prepared remarks, the balance sheet remains in very good shape and we'll
be in very good shape to do other deals if -- when those opportunities become available. So obviously,
we're going to continue to be focused on making sure we get good strong financial returns. I think the
ServiceChannel deal is a good example of that, both accretive in 12 months, but also with a 10% ROIC in
5 years.

So I think there's lots of those kinds of situations available to us in the second half. And so you never
know if you're going to get a deal done. But I think we both have the capacity financially as well as the
capability to pull off another deal if an opportunity becomes available. So it's hard to predict those things.
And and what happens. But we are busy and we feel confident that we could get a deal done if we have
the opportunity.

So just focusing on the bigger picture with Gordian and Accruent. Again, you mentioned there's still a bit
of noise in terms of the varying pace of return to work, especially lately, but you did mention that clients
are accelerating work on key projects within Gordian. So does that give you better visibility into growth
continuing to accelerate within the businesses? And can the improvement we've seen in state and local
budgets and/or stimulus gives you an additional boost?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. We -- so first of all, Gordian had a very good quarter. What we did see in June, and we mentioned
this a little bit is there was a little bit of budget clearing at the end of the fiscal year. And I think between
stimulus and what's already we're seeing in projects, I think we're going to have -- we feel confident we'll
have a good year at Gordian, for sure. So I think as we look forward, the Gordian not only in job order
contracting, but estimating and even facility assessments, we're seeing good business.

And I think on the Accruent side, you're seeing, as we said, we're starting to see those back to work
projects come back, people who are looking for hoteling solutions, we mentioned in the prepared remarks,
our event and hoteling planning solution is -- sort of leads the way as people start to think about bringing
people back to the office.

So we saw that accelerate. We really like the professional services because a lot -- in a lot of those
situations, that's the first part of Accruent before we see the SaaS revenue. We see those projects come
in where we go in and help clients get started. So I think a number of places where we're seeing real
opportunity, and I think we'll -- we really believe that those will continue. And as I said in a previous
question, professional services being up double digits in the second half is going to be real helpful to us
sort of building that business here for not only this year, but obviously into next year.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's helpful, Jim. And then you mentioned a nice rebound in industrial and oil and gas end markets
as ISC, Intelex. That is the recovery more a function of easy comparisons? Or are you starting to see
a relatively significant rebound at this point in the energy-related markets? And what do you see going
forward for that business?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes, I think we see continued improvement. I would say there was some easy comp aspect to the ISC
number in the quarter. But one of the things I was -- I think we're really excited about is the work they've
been doing over the last 1.5 years to sort of move the business into new markets outside of oil and gas.
And we saw some success in that in the quarter as well.

So they're building the business around different end markets. At the same time, they're starting to see
instrument revenue and rental revenue come up, which is really, I think, consistent with people coming
back to work in oil and gas and projects coming back into those customers. So we continue -- we think
that continues to accelerate through the remaining part of the year.

Can we just get updated? There was a plan that you would start these growth investments, $35 million in

Charles E. McLaughlin
Senior VP & CFO

So Dean, we called out that we'd have $35 million. You're correct. We had $15 million in Q2, which we did
kick off and invest in Q2. And then you think about $10 million in each of Q3 and Q4.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

And then relative to maybe what we saw, I think -- and the other thing I'd just call on, there's a couple
of examples in the call. The II900 that we called out at Fluke and the OneQA at Fluke Health, those are
both examples of investments that we did 18 months ago that are now really paying off. So I think it's
a good example of, hey, we give the operating companies money to accelerate product development for
accelerated growth. And that's a good example we're seeing the payback of some of those investments
that we did roughly 1.5 years ago.

Relative to Pioneer Square Labs, as we said in the Q2 call, about half of that $15 million and half of that
$35 million would be at the Fort and at PSL. We mentioned the spin in of TeamSense in the quarter or in
early July. That's part of that investment is to fund TeamSense here as we spin that into the business.
We're really excited about that opportunity.

And then obviously, the FORT investments, which we said were probably more like 3 or 4 year -- 2 or 3
years out, relative to payback and return and is just to bring those numbers back, we thought it was about
a $250 million growth opportunity for all of that work, and we still believe that that's true.

We're probably hopefully planning to get 30 to 50 of that. And as we continue to build out the product
lines and build out some of the ideas, we'll have greater granularity to that. But we're really excited about
the work that we got done in the quarter, which is really going to be good work for us in next year and the
years to follow.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And that's a nice lead in for the second question about how do these spin-ins work? With
TeamSense, are there more in the pipeline? And what are the conditions that a startup is ready to be
brought into Fortive?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So each one has its own sort of particular set of metrics. We have a board that's made up of team
members from Fortive and team members from PSL. They sort of advocate for the business through
a period of time prior to the spin in, we fund that. And then we make a decision whether the business
ought be spun in if it's good strategically or really is helpful to us strategically, there might be situations
where we actually go and get external funding. And then there are situations where we maybe wouldn't go
forward.

Right now, we have 3 that we're funding, the 1 that we spun in TeamSense, we have 2 others. We'll
make some decisions here based -- and those decision criteria are individual to the businesses based
on what they're trying to accomplish strategically, generally has the number of end customers, they
have to solidify, there are certain goals around what they're doing with those customers from a product
perspective is the product ready. And if we achieve those milestones, then we start to assess the potential
opportunity.

Pioneer Square Labs is really good, obviously, with their experience of bringing to us how we think that if
we were to go for an external investment as an example, how would that business do in that regard. So I
think it's been a great experience, and we're really celebrating 12 months of partnership here.

And I was just with the senior team there at PSL a couple of weeks ago to talk about the partnership
and make sure it's really on good footing. And I think without a doubt, we're in a very good place from a

organizationally in which to continue to fund some of these things. We think if we've got great ideas, we'll

Your next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

So Jim, you have a mix of cyclical seasonal and I guess some more stable businesses. So maybe the
comps don't tell a lot here, but where do you think there's still room for, I guess, sequential growth that
sort of ignores the comps, obviously, as we're still coming off the bottom. It sounds like maybe ASP is one
of those given that it's still kind of lifting off the bottom and maybe 2Q, those elective procedures didn't
show as much progress as you hope. But is there anything else where you should still kind of keep an eye
on sequential progression maybe relative to comps or seasonality?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Well, I think obviously, with what happened last year with COVID, you've got to consider that.
And I think you'd see, as an example at Fluke on -- and Tek as an example, on a 2-year basis, they're
accelerating through the year. So we -- I think in that sense, we'll still -- what we have implied in the
guide is those businesses getting better over a 2-year basis. So I think we feel good. Sensing is maybe
in that same boat. So I think we still see some good progress here in a number of places. And as you
mentioned, we see -- we'll see ASP get a little bit better.

Our SaaS business is -- with 40% recurring revenue, we have a large part of the portfolio that did
exceptionally well through 2020 and has continued to do well, and we called that out mostly the SaaS
businesses that we have. But obviously, we continue to build our ARR portfolio. That continues to grow
well. We'll have double-digit ARR growth at the end of the year for the full year.

So I think we're accelerating the businesses that have been stable. And I think what you're starting to see
is some of the businesses have a little bit more cyclicality still have some room with them. And what we've
seen is, I think, good margin progression with those businesses as we've seen the revenue come back.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. And then just on that strength in Gordian and Accruent you have, I think it adds a lot of validity
to the ServiceChannel deal that you've already announced. Anything else that either sort of a shift as
a function of COVID or something else where over the last couple of years, you said, "Hey, we like this
before, but gosh, that seems to even have more legs now, and maybe we should look for more externally
anything else that sticks out in the portfolio?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think the obvious one is just everything we're doing in EH&S. I think sustainability is becoming
such an important topic for companies around the world and not just large cap. I mean just about every
company in the world now is trying to understand their carbon footprint, they're trying to understand how
to action sustainability work. And we're just so well positioned with Intelex, ehsAI around those trends. I
think it's hard to call out anything better than that just given the massive amount of work and effort that's
been going into sustainability everywhere in the world.

So I think that's certainly a secular driver that we knew it was good a few years ago when we bought in
Intelex. But I think every quarter, we own that business, we realized we have an even bigger opportunity.

After all these wonderful nitty-gritty questions, I want to get back up to 35,000 feet for a second. You've
[ taught me ] into the principles and the behaviors of lean that are important and those rules don't really
change. But can you talk a little bit about what lean taught you -- I'm sorry, what COVID taught you about
lean? And what's your experience in the last couple of years with SaaS models has taught your you about
lean? And then I have a quick follow-up.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure. Well, I think Cliff, I wouldn't have thought that we could have virtualized some of our resources
and still maintained a lot of the daily management things that we've done. It's just been incredible. And
certainly, with some of the supply chain things I was describing, our team's ability to collaborate, continue
to do Kaizen events in many cases, certainly problem-solving events in some cases, virtually. I would have
never thought we could have done those at the level of quality that we're doing them today.

So I think kudos to our FBS team that virtualized all of our tools. And I think that's certainly a great
example of probably my own learning that these things can be virtualized and we've seen some great
efforts here over the last year or so, 1.5 years in that regard.

Relative to SaaS, I think there's really a couple of things. You know this better than anyone. Problem-
solving is problem-solving, value stream mapping, it's value stream mapping. Every SaaS business has
processes that are inefficient, sometimes they're customer success, sometimes they're customer --
sometimes they're product development. But I think fundamentally, we find that those processes can be
improved. And I think in a SaaS business is no different than any other business in terms of a culture
of continuous improvement on everything you do is a winning culture. So I think those are -- those are
certainly things that we're seeing. And obviously, our -- what we're trying to show in our Investor Day is
so many examples of where that's really playing out thus far.

Clifford F. Ransom
Ransom Research, Inc.

How about -- you held my hand trying to -- when I was trying to apply lean principles to transactional
processes, traditional transactional processes. When you took over Fortive, you said, look, we've got all
the original divisions where the great pushes in lean came in the '80s and the '90s. And you said, I don't
haven't got a business that I can't add another 100 -- 200 basis points, too. How do you feel about your
progress of taking these lean principles and putting it into SI and OP and new product development and
accounting for lean as opposed to land accounting.

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean it's a lot of the same stuff. We applied value stream mapping into the Accruent business and
significantly impacted DSO right away. And that was already a negative working capital business that
we just made -- I think we made better. So I think these transactional processes exist just as much in
software businesses. And our teams -- our Gordian, we called out Gordian in several places, who's applied
these things all across the board and made great improvements.

So I -- and we've certainly seen that. Intelex' operating profit is significantly above where it was when
we bought the company. I could say that about all the software businesses. So we found those pools of
opportunity. They're sometimes in different places, but ultimately, if we can teach the principles to the
leadership teams of these businesses, and encourage them and quite frankly, support them, we tend to
have real good success.

This is actually Rob Jamieson in for Joe. Just wanted to go back to ASP real quick. I know we've talked
a lot about that, but the elective procedures just wondered kind of what regions maybe underperformed
versus your expectations in the quarter? And what regions might provide some upside in the second half
that you kind of called out?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

It's mostly the U.S. Now part of that is because it's our biggest business. So our biggest region. So I
would say most of it was in the U.S., a little bit in Europe. But I think for the most part, most markets
outside of the United States were actually pretty stable. So we're -- because of the share that we have in
the U.S., and we're probably a little bit more receptive to the COVID change the elective procedure change
than we are elsewhere -- we can make a little bit more of our own luck in the other parts of the world, and
that's what we did, so I think that really is where we stand.

Relative to going forward, as we said, we probably thought that we were getting closer to 100% by the
end of the year. We're probably a couple of hundred basis points different than that now where we stand
for the second half.

Okay. That helps. And then just another one. And I know it might be a bit early for this question, but
because ServiceChannel hasn't closed yet. But as you think about that rolling into the business and you
talked a lot about FORT and the AI initiatives that you have at Investor Day. I was just wondering, like it
looks like a good overlay for some of the services they provide as well from the matching service providers
with customers and then the back end on the analytical side.

Is that something that you're thinking about enhancing? And then I guess on the flip side, too, when you
think about those AI technology, you have inheriting from like [ ServiceNow ] from the analytical side.
Is that something you might be able to leverage across the rest of the organization through the FORT
initiative too?

James A. Lico
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So number one, they have a [ SKOUT ] product, which is really their data analytics product. We
definitely think we have an opportunity to accelerate the great things they were already planning to do
with the FORT. So the answer to that is absolutely, that will be a real opportunity for us going forward.
It's a very small part of ServiceChannel today, but we think it can be a real important part not only the
revenue stream but of the customer capture and the ability to accelerate the network flywheel that we talk
about between enterprise customers and the service network.

Relative to algorithms, the answer is yes. One of the principal roles of the FORT is actually to re-task
algorithms is to create algorithms that we can apply to the same business problems or the same growth
opportunities within the business. Probably the place we're doing that the most is in our software
businesses around customer churn predictive models.

Once we get those models up and running, we can apply them to different customer sets within different
operating businesses. So we absolutely re-task those algorithms, and that's a big part of the FORT's job is
to maintain those algorithms and to continue to make them better as we get more and more data running
through them.

At this time, that does conclude our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over for any closing
remarks.

Thanks, Pasha, and thanks, everyone, for taking the time today. I think what you saw today with earnings
was a really strong quarter. We continue, I think, to really work hard and diligent to really take advantage
of the opportunities of a better market. I think you saw that with the guide and certainly saw that in the
margin profile. And we're really excited about the work going on. A lot of hard work going on with our
team every day.

So I want to thank our team for all the hard work in the quarter and all the hard work that's going to
continue through the year as we continue to take advantage of the opportunities of a growing market

up calls and conversations that we have. Have a great rest of the summer for those of you who haven't
