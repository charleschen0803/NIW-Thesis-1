Presentation

Operator

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 Hess Corporation Conference
Call. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this
conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay
Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.

Jay R. Wilson
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Josh. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter
earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website,
www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown
risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such
statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly
reports filed with the SEC.

Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation
of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the line
with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly,
Chief Financial Officer. In case there are any audio issues, we will be posting transcripts of each speaker's
prepared remarks on our website following the presentation. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess.

John B. Hess
CEO & Director

Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. Today, I will
review our continued progress in executing our strategy, Greg Hill then will discuss our operations, and
John Rielly will cover our financial results.

With COP26 beginning this Sunday, it is appropriate to address the energy transition. Climate change
is the greatest scientific undertaking of the 21st century. The world has two challenges: To grow our
global energy supply by about 20% in the next 20 years; and to reach net 0 emissions by 2050. The
International Energy Agency published its latest World Energy outlook earlier this month, which provides
four scenarios to shed light on these challenges. It is important to remember that these are scenarios, not
forecasts, to help guide policymakers and business leaders in their decision-making. In all four scenarios,
oil and gas will still be needed in the decades to come. Significantly more investment will be required
to meet the world's growing energy needs, much more in renewables and much more in oil and gas. A
reasonable estimate for global oil and gas investment from these IEA scenarios is at least $400 billion
each year over the next 10 years. Last year, that number was $300 billion. This year's estimate is $340
billion to ensure a successful and orderly energy transition. We need to have climate literacy, energy
literacy and economic literacy.

Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth, while
delivering industry-leading environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. By investing
only in high-return low-cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated and focused portfolio that is
balanced between short-cycle and long-cycle assets. Our cash engines are the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico
and Southeast Asia, where we have competitively advantaged assets and operating capabilities. Guyana
is our growth engine and is on track to become a significant cash engine in the coming years as multiple
phases of low-cost oil developments come online. Also, by adding a third rig in the Bakken in September
and completing the turnaround and expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant, the Bakken is expected to generate
significant free cash flow in the years ahead.

HESS CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

By successfully executing our strategy, our company is positioned to deliver strong and durable cash flow
growth through the end of the decade. Based upon the most recent sell-side consensus estimates, our
cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which
is 50% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the S&P 500. As our portfolio generates increasing
free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction, and then cash returns to shareholders through
dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.

We have continued to maintain financial strength as well as managing for risk. As of September 30, we
had $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet. In July, we prepaid half of our $1 billion term loan maturing
in March 2023 and we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. This debt reduction, combined
with the start-up of Liza Phase 2 early next year, is expected to drive our debt to EBITDAX ratio under 2
and also enable us to consider increasing cash returns to shareholders.

In August, we completed the sale of our interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million,
effective January 1, 2021, and received $375 million in proceeds from Hess Midstream's buyback of Class
B units from its sponsors, Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners. Earlier this month, our
company also received net proceeds of $108 million from the public offering of Hess owned Class A shares
of Hess Midstream. The Denmark sale and these midstream monetizations brought material value forward
and further strengthened our cash and liquidity position.

Key to our long-term strategy is Guyana, one of the industry's best investments. On the Stabroek
Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we announced the 19th and 20th
significant discoveries during the third quarter at Whiptail and Pinktail. And on October 7, we announced
the 21st significant discovery on the block at Cataback. These discoveries will underpin our queue of future
low-cost oil developments. We see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs on the Stabroek Block, producing
more than 1 million gross barrels of oil per day in 2027 and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered
resources on the block. On October 7, we increased the gross discovered recoverable resource estimate
for the block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the previous estimate of more
than 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration
potential remaining.

In terms of our current Guyana developments, gross production from the Liza Phase 1 complex averaged
124,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track for startup
in early 2022 with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, and the Liza Unity FPSO
arrived in Guyana on Monday. Our third development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field is on
track to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Our three
sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. The
plan of development for our fourth development on the block at Yellowtail was recently submitted to the
government of Guyana for approval. Pending government approvals, the project is envisioned to have a
gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day, with first oil in 2025.

Turning to sustainability. We are proud to be recognized as an industry leader in our environmental, social
and governance performance and disclosure. Earlier this month, our company received a AAA rating in the
MSCI ESG ratings for 2021 after earning a ratings for the previous 10 consecutive years. The AAA rating
designates Hess as a leader in managing industry-specific ESG risks relative to peers and reflects our
strong management practices to reduce carbon emissions as well as our top quartile performance in areas
such as biodiversity and land use, reduction of air and water emissions and waste and making a positive
impact on the communities where we operate.

In summary, we remain focused on executing our strategy and achieving strong operational and ESG
performance. Our company is uniquely positioned to deliver cash flow growth over the next decade, that
is not only industry-leading, but which we believe will rank among the best in the S&P 500. After our term
loan is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will prioritize return of capital to
our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. Thank you, and I will
now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update.

HESS CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Thanks, John. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance, meeting our
production targets despite extended hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and safely executing
a major turnaround at our Tioga Gas Plant in North Dakota. Company-wide net production averaged
265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, in line with our guidance.

In the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021, we expect company-wide net production to average
approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.

Turning to the Bakken. Third quarter net production averaged 148,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This was above our guidance of approximately 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and primarily
reflected strong execution of the Tioga Gas Plant turnaround and expansion. No small task in a COVID
environment that required strict adherence to extensive safety protocols to keep more than 650 workers
safe. For the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average between 155,000 and 160,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2021, we forecast our Bakken net production to average
approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our previous guidance range of
155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This guidance reflects an increase in NGL prices,
which reduces volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts but significantly increases this year's
earnings and cash flow.

In the third quarter, we drilled 18 wells and brought 19 new wells online. In the fourth quarter, we expect
to drill approximately 19 wells and to bring approximately 18 new wells online. And for the full year 2021,
we continue to expect to drill approximately 65 wells and to bring approximately 50 new wells online.
In terms of drilling and completion costs, although we have experienced some cost inflation, we are
maintaining our full year average forecast of $5.8 million per well in 2021. Since February, we've been
operating two rigs. But given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high-return drilling
locations, we added a third rig in September. Moving to a 3-year -- 3-rig program will allow us to grow
cash flow and production, better optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our
unit cash costs.

Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, third quarter net production averaged
32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our guidance range of 35,000 to 40,000 barrels of
oil equivalent per day. Our results reflected an extended period of recovery following Hurricane Ida, which
caused power outages at transportation and processing facilities downstream of our platforms. Production
was restored at all of our facilities by the end of September. In the fourth quarter, we forecast Gulf of
Mexico net production to average between 40,000 and 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the
full year 2021, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production remains approximately 45,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day.

In Southeast Asia, net production in the third quarter was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, in line
with our guidance of 50,000 to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting the impact of planned
maintenance shutdowns and lower nominations due to COVID. Fourth quarter net production is forecast
to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and our full year 2021 net production
forecast remains at approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Now turning to Guyana. In the third quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 124,000 barrels
of oil per day or 32,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess. Replacement of the flash gas compression
system on the Liza Destiny with a modified design is planned for the fourth quarter and production
optimization work is now planned to take place in the first quarter of 2022. These two projects are
expected to result in higher production capacity and reliability. Net production from Liza Phase 1 is
forecast to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter and for the full year
2021. The Liza Phase 2 development will utilize the 220,000 barrels of oil per day Unity FPSO, which
arrived in Guyana Monday evening. Next steps will be more in line installation and umbilical and riser
hookup. First oil remains on track for first quarter 2022.

Turning to our third development at Payara, the Prosperity FPSO hull entered the Keppel yard in Singapore
on August 1. The topside fabrication at Dyna-Mac and development drilling are underway. The overall
project is approximately 60% complete. The prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000
barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2024. As for our fourth development in

HESS CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Yellowtail, earlier this month, the joint venture submitted a plan of development to the government of
Guyana. Pending government approvals and project sanctioning, the Yellowtail project will utilize an FPSO
with a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is targeted for 2025.

As John mentioned, we announced three discoveries since July. In July, we announced that the Whiptail-1
and 2 wells encountered 246 feet and 167 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs,
respectively. This discovery is located approximately 4 miles southeast of Uaru-1 and 3 miles west of
Yellowtail. In September, we announced that the Pinktail-1 well located approximately 22 miles southeast
of Liza-1, encountered 220 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. And finally, earlier this
month, we announced a discovery at Cataback located approximately 4 miles east of Turbot-1. The well
encountered 243 feet of high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, of which approximately 102 feet
was oil-bearing. These discoveries further underpin future developments and contributed to the increase
of estimated gross discovered recoverable resources on the Stabroek block to approximately 10 billion
barrels of oil equivalent. Exploration and appraisal activities in the fourth quarter will include drilling the
Fangtooth-1 exploration well, located approximately 11 miles northwest of Liza-1. This well is a significant
step-out test that will target deeper Campanion and Santonian aged reservoirs. Appraisal activities in the
fourth quarter will include drill stem tests at Longtail-2 and Whiptail-2 as well as drilling the Tripletail-2
well.

In closing, we have once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery and are well positioned to
deliver significant value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.

John P. Rielly
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2021 to the second
quarter of 2021. We had net income of $115 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a net
loss of $73 million in the second quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting
comparability of earnings between periods, we had net income of $86 million in the third quarter of 2021
compared to net income of $74 million in the second quarter of 2021. Third quarter earnings include an
after-tax gain of $29 million from the sale of our interest in Denmark.

Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P had net income of $149 million in the third quarter of 2021
compared to net income of $122 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components
of adjusted E&P results between the third quarter and second quarter of 2021 were as follows: Higher
realized crude oil, NGL and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $110 million; lower sales
volumes reduced earnings by $147 million; lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $37 million;
[indiscernible] cost increased earnings by $14 million; lower exploration expenses increased earnings
by $10 million; all other items increased earnings by $3 million for an overall increase in third quarter
earnings of $27 million.

Sales volumes in the third quarter were lower than the second quarter, primarily due to hurricane-related
downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, planned maintenance downtime and lower nominations in Malaysia
and lower sales in the Bakken, resulting from the planned Tioga gas plant maintenance turnaround. In
Guyana, we sold three 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil in the third quarter, up from two 1 million-barrel
cargoes of oil sold in the second quarter. For the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted
compared with production by approximately 175,000 barrels, which had an insignificant impact on our
after-tax results for the quarter.

Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $61 million in the third quarter of 2021
compared with $76 million in the prior quarter. Third quarter results included costs related to the Tioga
Gas Plant maintenance turnaround that was safely and successfully completed. Midstream EBITDA, before
noncontrolling interest, amounted to $203 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $229 million
in the previous quarter.

Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were
$2.41 billion and total liquidity was $6 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt
and finance lease obligations totaled $6.1 billion. During the third quarter, we received net proceeds of

HESS CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

$375 million from the sale of $15.6 million Hess-owned Class B units of Hess Midstream and proceeds of
approximately $130 million from the sale of our interest in Denmark. In July, we prepaid $500 million of
our $1 billion term loan, and we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022.

In October, we received net proceeds of approximately $108 million from the public offering of 4.3 million
Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream. Our ownership in Hess Midstream, on a consolidated basis,
is approximately 44% compared with 46% prior to these two recent transactions. In the third quarter, net
cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $631 million compared with
$659 million in the second quarter. In the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after
changes in operating assets and liabilities was $615 million compared with $785 million in the second
quarter. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the third quarter decreased net cash provided in
operating activities by $16 million compared with an increase of $126 million in the second quarter.

Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $12.76 per barrel of oil equivalent,
including Libya, and $13.45 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the third quarter of 2021. We
project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $12 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for
the fourth quarter, and $11.75 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year compared to previous
full year guidance of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent. The updated guidance reflects the impact of
higher realized selling prices in 2021, with significantly improved cash flow but reduced volumes received
under percentage of proceeds contracts and increased production taxes in the Bakken. DD&A expense
was $11.77 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.38 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding
Libya, in the third quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $13 to $13.50
per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $12.50
to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya,
to be in the range of $25 to $26 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $24.25 to $25 per
barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.

Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55
million in the fourth quarter and approximately $160 million for the full year, which is at the lower end
of our previous full year guidance of $160 million to $170 million. The midstream tariff is projected to be
approximately $295 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $1.095 billion for the full year. E&P
income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the
fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, which is up
from previous guidance of $125 million to $135 million, reflecting higher commodity prices. We expect
noncash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the fourth quarter. For the year
2022, we have purchased WTI collars for 90,000 barrels of oil per day with a floor price of $60 per barrel
and a ceiling price of $90 per barrel. We have also entered into Brent collars for 60,000 barrels of oil per
day with a floor price of $65 per barrel and a ceiling price of $95 per barrel. The cost of this 2022 hedge
program is $161 million, which will be amortized ratably over 2022.

During the fourth quarter, we expect to sell two 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil from Guyana. Our E&P
capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $650 million in the fourth quarter.
Full year guidance remains unchanged at approximately $1.9 billion. For Midstream, we anticipate net
income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $70 million for the fourth
quarter and the full year is projected to be approximately $280 million, which is at the midpoint of our
previous guidance of $275 million to $285 million.
Turning to corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for
the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $130 million, which
is down from our previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million. Interest expense is estimated to be
in the range of $90 million to $95 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the
range of $375 million to $380 million compared to our previous guidance of approximately $380 million.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the
operator.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Greg, I wanted to maybe start with you on Liza Phase 2. You mentioned that the ship got to the Stabroek
Block on Monday. But just using Liza Phase 1 as a guide, can you give us a sense around how many days
-- months do you think you could be the first oil?

Gregory P. Hill
COO & President of Exploration & Production

Yes, sure. So thanks for the question, Arun. Remember now that it's arrived in water, the first thing
that we have to do is more to the seafloor. And then obviously, there's a lot of flow lines and risers and
umbilicals to get hooked up to the vessel. So what I would say is we are firmly on track for an early 2022
start-up. And don't think I could be more definitive than that, but early 2022 looks like very possible.

Arun Jayaram
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Great. And then my follow-up, Greg, maybe for you as well. One of the questions from the buy
side is just around overall inflation and just how to think about some of the inflationary pressures, raw
materials, et cetera, on future phases of the project. I know that you're in the market now with Exxon and
Yellowtail. And then one of your key subsea provider did put some color around the subsea kit that they
expect around Yellowtail and Uaru. They cited maybe a $500 million to $1 billion range for Yellowtail and a
little bit over $1 billion for Uaru. So just maybe you could just help us think about inflationary pressures,
Greg?

Gregory P. Hill
COO & President of Exploration & Production

Sure. I think first of all, yes, there is inflation going on. I think there's a couple of things we have to
remember. First of all, for the first 3 phases, which you mentioned, those are under existing EPC contracts.
So we're basically insulated from cost increases on those EPC contracts? And then ExxonMobil is doing an
extraordinary job, I think, of utilizing this "design one, build many" strategy, to deliver efficiencies. Now
on the Yellowtail, we still don't have the final numbers. So once that project is sanctioned, we'll give the
market color on what the costs are. I do think it's important to remember the nature of the PSC though.
So by the time you get the Yellowtail, the efficiency of the PSC is so rapid that any cost increases rapidly
get recovered. So the impact on overall project return is not very much at all, right, because of that
superefficient PSC. And the breakevens for Yellowtail, we project even with some cost increases, we'll be
in the -- firmly in the $25 to $32 barrel range. So one of the best projects on the planet even with some
potential cost increases. Great project.

Operator

Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

Guys, I know you haven't given a 2022 outlook yet. But given the oil price recovery that we've seen and
the very smart hedges, I think you guys have been in place. I go back to the CapEx guidance that you
gave in 2018 at your strategy day. And I wonder if I could just ask you to give us a kind of framework as
to how we should think about the spending trajectory? And if I may, embedded in that question, be blunt
with you that I think there's some concern over the cost the sticker shock on Yellowtail. So if I threw out

a number and said where we should be thinking something in the $12 billion type of range. Would that be
after [ mark ]?

John P. Rielly
Executive VP & CFO

Doug, let me start with just giving some color on our capital for 2022. Now you know, obviously, we will
finalize that, and we'll give our full guidance in January. But from a directional standpoint, let's start with
the Bakken. We've added a rig there. Rule of thumb when we add a rig, it's approximately $200 million
when we add a rig in the Bakken. We're also -- to your point, with the higher prices, we're seeing more
ballots for nonoperated wells. So for that, we could see an increase of approximately $50 million in our
non-op JV wells next year. So if you're looking at Bakken, approximately $250 million of a capital increase
as we look at next year, obviously, with a pickup in production and an increasing cash flow, though also
as well coming from Bakken. In Guyana, we expect our development spend. So we went into the year
with the guide with $780 million for our development spend in Guyana. We're going to come in under
that. And so let me just say we'll probably be approximately $750 million on our Guyana development
spend this year. So with Liza Phase 2 and a continued development on Payara and we'll begin spending
on Yellowtail, we think it's approximately $1 billion will be the Guyana capital for the developments next
year. So approximately, again, another $250 million there. The other areas then are Gulf of Mexico and
Southeast Asia. So on the Gulf of Mexico, we're basically not spending much money at all this year in the
Gulf of Mexico. And we typically spend $150 million to $200 million. And we do plan to drill a tieback well
and one exploration well next year. And in Southeast Asia, we're looking to complete our Phase 3 and
Phase 4 developments in North Malay Basin. So we'll have some increase there. So I'd say combined,
those will be about $200 million. So I've got $500 million from Bakken and Guyana, $200 million Gulf of
Mexico and Southeast Asia. But I have to remind everyone, we'll have Liza Phase 2 coming online. And
so I'll just do I always do that simple math when Liza Phase 2 comes on in full and we have our share of
220,000 barrels of oil per day, we're basically -- and I'm just going to use a $60 Brent price and about
a $10 cash cost, we pick up $1 billion of additional cash flow from Liza Phase 2 alone when that comes
on. And then obviously, you have Payara and Yellowtail. So we'll get much more cash flow as each FPSO
comes on. So that's a directional. We'll update in January. John, you want to talk on Yellowtail?

John B. Hess
CEO & Director

Yes. And Doug on Yellowtail well, the FTPs have been submitted to the government, and it is higher cost. I
think everybody needs to realize that this FPSO is going to have capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels
of oil per day on a gross basis. It will be our largest oil development to date in Guyana. And while its cost
will be higher, the resource we are developing is significantly higher. And this development has simply
outstanding financial returns, some of the best in the industry, as Greg mentioned, and a breakeven cost
between $25 and $32 per barrel Brent. So it's outstanding economics. Yes, the costs are higher, but the
resource we're recovering as much higher, and these are some of the best economics in the industry.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

So I wouldn't [indiscernible] anyone at $12 billion, John?

John B. Hess
CEO & Director

I won't comment on that. Let's let the FTP be approved, and then we'll announce the official number.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division

My follow-up also a quick one. And it really is on Yellowtail, you mentioned the $250 million is now being
confirmed in your release. The EIS still [ $220 million, $250 million ]. Greg, I just want to just check in
with you on how should we think about production optimization on all of these FPSOs? Is it 10% to 15%,
in other words, above the nameplate?

Gregory P. Hill
COO & President of Exploration & Production

Yes, Doug. So I think based on -- again, this is just my experience being in this business 38 years. I would
think that for developments of these size and everyone will be bespoke, so everyone will be a little bit
different. But I think a range of 10% to 20% capacity for debottlenecking or capacity increases. This is a
reasonable expectation. Again, everyone will be a little bit bespoke. You'll wait and get some dynamic data
to see where the bottlenecks are, but I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation for future vessels.
And I think the second point is, remember, these increases in capacity are typically achieved for very low
investment. And obviously, with PSC, the rapid cost recovery, these are very profitable things to do.

Operator

Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

I think previously that the expectation of the [ debottleneck, Liza-1 ], we'll be doing at the same time as
the turnaround and now is being separate and push it to the first quarter. Is there any particular reason
for that decision?

John B. Hess
CEO & Director

Greg?

Gregory P. Hill
COO & President of Exploration & Production

Yes. So Paul, as you said, the optimization work on Destiny is now planned for the first quarter. This was
simply deferred to allow other planned maintenance and inspection work to be done concurrently, which
is much more efficient. So the operator just pushed it to get some efficiencies and completing a bunch of
other work at the same time while they had the vessel down, which we fully support.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Would that be more efficient that when the vessel is done, then you do the optimization? I mean, I'm
actually surprised you say you will be more efficient to separate into two events?

Gregory P. Hill
COO & President of Exploration & Production

No, it won't. That's what I meant, Paul, is that when we take it down to do the optimization, ExxonMobil
wanted to do some other work while the vessel was down. So pulling some work forward, some
maintenance work that was scheduled for later in the year. By doing that all at the same time
concurrently, it's just much more efficient. And so they needed parts and pieces and et cetera and that's
why it got pushed to the first quarter.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

And Greg, I think originally, when you signed the agreement with the Guyana government, at some point
that you guys are supposed to develop the gas resource there. I mean, now that I think up to Yellowtail
does not seem like you guys are going to do it. So at any game plan when that the gas will need to be
developed or that's been big [indiscernible] still subject to negotiation with the government.

John B. Hess
CEO & Director

Yes, Greg?

HESS CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Gregory P. Hill
COO & President of Exploration & Production

Yes. So I think there's 2 pieces, Paul. So the first piece is the gas to energy project, right? It's going to be
a slip stream of gas, if you will, 50 million to 100 million cubic feet a day pipeline to shore that is -- would
supply gas in onshore power plant to generate lower cost, cleaner, more reliable energy for the benefit
of the people on it. That project is in the design phase right now. And once it's done, then we'll share the
details of the project after a sanction. Regarding the long-term gas solution, which is what I think you
were referring to, there are studies [indiscernible], but it's way out in the future, Paul. So it's not anything
certainly we need to worry about in the next 5 years, potentially even well beyond that. So -- but there
are studies going on because remember, the highest value of the gas is pressure maintenance of these
reservoirs significantly increase recovery. And the other unique part about the gas is it's miscible. So there
will be an enhanced oil recovery effect as a result of putting that gas back in the reservoir. So the highest
and most beneficial use, if you will, of that gas is actually reinjection.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

And the final question for me, I think, is for John. John, I think you mentioned that once that your net
debt to EBITDA get to, say, below 2x, you will consider increasing the cash return to shareholders. And
at that point that how should we look at it? I mean, is there a ways you're targeting that the incremental
cash flow, say 50% still going to the balance sheet and 50% for incremental cash return to shareholder or
any kind of estimate that you can share? And also at that point, should we assume that the main vehicle
is going to be buyback? Or it's just going to be increasing the common dividend? Or that is the variable
dividend? How should we be looking at those?

John P. Rielly
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So our strategy remains the same, and you said it basically would get Phase 2 online, we pay off the
remaining part of the term loan. And our debt to EBITDAX will be below 2 at that point, and we'll begin
increasing returns to shareholders. What we're going to do first with the returns is increase our dividend.
We'll start there. And then obviously, as each FPSO comes on, we get significant -- as I mentioned earlier,
another $1 billion with Payara, another $1 billion with Yellowtail will have an increasing free cash flow. We
will still progressively increase the dividend, but when we have that free cash flow, the majority of that will
go back to shareholders. And that point, we'll be looking at opportunistic share repurchases.

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

John, when you're talking about that once you drop below 2x, I suppose that your ultimate target will be
much below 2x EBITDA ratio. So what is that ultimate ratio you want? Is it less than 1x or less than half a
multiple point?

John P. Rielly
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'm going to answer it two ways. Once we do get under 2x, we are comfortable with our absolute debt
levels. We have -- our liquidity is very good. We have a 300 maturity -- $300 million maturity coming in
2024. Our next maturity is into 2027. So we'll continue. We can pay off the maturity as they come due.
And then what will happen is because the EBITDA just increases so much with each FPSO will drive under
1x fairly quickly actually when these FPSOs come online. So yes, we do want to be below 1x. And look, we
can do that at various commodity prices, just again, due to the great returns that we have in Guyana.

Operator

Our next question comes from Phillips Johnston with Capital One.

HESS CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Just 1 for me. I guess on last quarter's call, we did touch on your strategic thoughts around test
Midstream, but I just wanted to follow up on the topic, just given the size of that asset. It seems like
you guys obviously want to get your Bakken volumes up to that optimal level of [ 200 ] a day before
plateauing at that level. Once that occurs and once operational and marketing control of Midstream is
perhaps less critical, would you think it makes sense to harvest that asset just by selling it to a third party
and freeing up capital in the process just to potentially return that to shareholders?

John P. Rielly
Executive VP & CFO

Phillips, I mean, we are very happy with our Midstream investment and GIP is too. So the Midstream
continues to add what we believe is differentiated value to our E&P assets. Like you said, being able to
get it up to 200,000 barrels a day. Also, with that maintaining the operational and marketing control, it
provides takeaway optionality for us to high-value markets and as John mentioned earlier, we're very
focused on minimizing our emission. So it gives us the ability to increase our gas capture and drive
down flaring. So both GIP and Hess remained committed to maximizing the long-term value of Hess
Midstream. So the offerings we did, we had the secondary in Q1 and earlier this month, they were
designed to increase the float, as Midstream get their liquidity up there. And the Q3 buyback actually
helped test Midstream optimize its capital structure, getting to that 3x leverage position. So proforma for
these transactions, Hess Midstream, it maintains a strong credit position and it has continuing free cash
flow after distributions. So it will continue to have that low leverage and ample balance sheet capacity
because with the free cash flow, we'll continue to drive that leverage down. So that can support future
growth there on the Midstream side or incremental return of capital to its shareholders, including Hess. So
basically, what we're talking about is continuing what we've been doing here with Hess Midstream.

John B. Hess
CEO & Director

And to be clear, our objective is to maximize the value of Hess Midstream to Hess and also maximize the
value of Hess Midstream to its unitholders and GIP as well.

Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Kickoff question is on hedging. And you made some progress in terms of 2022 and implemented the collar
strategy. Can you just talk high level why you thought that was the appropriate way to attack hedging?
And it does appear to still leave you a lot of optionality on the upside while protecting your downside but
maybe kick off there.

John P. Rielly
Executive VP & CFO

Sure. So I mean our hedge strategy, I mean, this is for 2022. It's consistent with our past strategy. We
look to provide significant downside protection to put -- do this while also given the majority of upside
to our shareholders. And we're looking for that price protection as we continue to fund our world class
investment opportunity in Guyana. So with it, as I mentioned, we have the collars, 90,000 barrels of oil
per day of WTI puts at a floor of $60 and the ceiling at $90 and the 60,000 barrels of oil per day Brent
puts floor at $65 and the ceiling at $95. We used those high-ceiling collars to reduce the cost of the
program just to be more efficient with our hedging program. But also, as you mentioned, we retain the
exposure to greater than $2 billion in additional cash flow. In the case of high oil prices above those hedge
floor prices. In addition, we have not hedged any of our natural gas, obviously, no NGL production hedged.
We haven't hedged all of our oil production either. So we continue to be in a good position to be able
to accrete up value with higher oil prices. But again, we've got that significant price protection on the
downside to continue the investment.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great, guys. And then the follow-up is just on the Bakken. Can you spend some time just talking about
your development strategy there. What would it take with oil prices up here for you guys to pursue a
growth strategy as opposed to a free cash flow strategy in the Bakken?

John B. Hess
CEO & Director

Greg?

Gregory P. Hill
COO & President of Exploration & Production

Yes, sure. So remember, the primary role of the Bakken in our portfolio is to be a cash engine. So that's
the first thing. And as such, any decision to add rigs in the Bakken is going to be driven by returns in our
corporate cash flow position. Now having said that, at $60 WTI, we have 2,200 future locations, which,
assuming you would go up to 4 rigs over 50 rig years of inventory. Our ultimate objective is we'd like to
get the Bakken back to 200,000 barrels a day. Why? Because that optimizes [indiscernible] maximizes the
free cash flow generation of the Bakken. We can do that by adding a fourth rig and depending on market
conditions next year, we would consider adding that fourth rig at the end of next year. And I think the
other thing that's important to remember is 4 rigs is the maximum we will run in the Bakken. That's sort
of the efficient frontier, if you will, to just take the Bakken to 200,000 barrels a day, plus or minus, and
then just hold it with that inventory we have for nearly a decade at 200,000 barrels a day. And at that
point, depending on oil price, it generates between $750 million and $1 billion of free cash flow. So it just
becomes this massive cash annuity for a very long time. And that is the strategy. Get it up to that level
and just hold that cash annuity position with our inventory as long as we can.

Operator

Our next question comes from Noel Parks with Tuohy Brothers.

Noel Augustus Parks
Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.

I was wondering if you could maybe walk through some of the components of the resource estimate
increase. You took it from 9 billion barrels to 10 billion barrels for the project. And just particularly
interested at the announcement, you said that some of that came from new discoveries like Cataback.
But I'm just wondering the degree -- well, two things, the degree that maybe derisking from the most
recent drilling help contribute to the incremental increase. And also, maybe you could drill down a little bit
on sand quality in the most recent discovery. The porosity is the consistent with your predrill analysis, et
cetera?

John B. Hess
CEO & Director

Yes, Greg?

Gregory P. Hill
COO & President of Exploration & Production

Sorry, I was on mute for a second. Look, I think the resource estimate was a combination of a lot of
things. Obviously, the big things were Whiptail-1 and Whiptail-2 and Pinktail and Cataback. So those
were the primary drivers of taking that number from the 9 -- greater than 9 billion to approximately 10
billion. So that was the majority of the change that move. I think it's important to also remember that in
spite of that, there's still multibillion barrels of additional upside above and beyond this 10 billion barrels
already. Regarding sand quality, it's all very good. I mean everything we've discovered this year has
extraordinary sand quality. As we mentioned, the Cataback well, the last well that we announced, had 102
feet of oil-bearing sand, but 243 feet of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs. And also Whiptail-1 was 246 feet,

HESS CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Whiptail-2 167 feet. So these are very large, very high-quality reservoirs in all three of those discoveries.
So there's no issues with sand quality or reservoir quality in any of those wells.

Noel Augustus Parks
Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.

I'm just wondering, in the more recent discoveries, anything you have been able to extrapolate, I guess,
maybe just from the consistency among the findings? Does that help inform your optimism for future
drilling and as you step out further?

Gregory P. Hill
COO & President of Exploration & Production

Sure. I think what it confirms is that, that entire Eastern Seaboard is what I like to call it from Turbot all
the way to Liza and further North is just great reservoir rock. And so part of our strategy going forward
in 2022 will be to continue to build out the prospectivity that we see and continue to explore in those
very high-quality upper Campanian reservoirs that I just talked about. The second objective we will have
in 2022 is to get more penetrations in the deep. That's the one with the most uncertainty now. As we
mentioned in the fourth quarter, we'll drill a well called Fangtooth that specifically aimed at the deep
stratigraphy. And when I say deep, it's lower Campanian upper Santonian, which is about 3,000 feet
deeper than those upper Campanion reservoirs. And then the third objective of our 2022 exploration and
appraisal program is to continue to appraise all these outstanding discoveries that we've made, right? So
appraise, explore upper Campanian, explore the deeper reservoirs. Those are our 3 primary objectives
next year.

Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Pickering Energy.

David Martin Heikkinen

I just wanted to check a couple of things on Yellowtail. Have you guys finalized, is it 45 or 55 wells with
the 8 different subsea sites? Just again, trying to narrow down on what the total cost is going to be as
we're putting estimates together?

Gregory P. Hill
COO & President of Exploration & Production

Yes. No, that's still under discussion with the partnership exactly what that configuration will be. And as
we said, when we take final sanction, we'll be able to share all those details as to what the final project
actually looks like.

John B. Hess
CEO & Director

And to follow up on the point that Greg was making Yellowtail has world-class economics and returns
because we're covering a lot larger resource. So while people are focused on cost, they should be focused
on the resource, which is a lot higher. Once we get the FTP, we can give granularity on that. And again,
the breakeven is going to be between $25 and $32 per barrel Brent.

David Martin Heikkinen
Pickering Energy Partners Insights

Yes, it's a much bigger areal extent, it looks like.

A huge area being developed with that versus Payara, even. And then it was very helpful to put together
the kind of incremental capital year-over-year. I did my math right, is that roughly [ 2.5 billion ] before
exploration expense?

John P. Rielly
Executive VP & CFO

No, that increased that I gave before. So it was [ 500 ] combined Bakken and Guyana and then [ 200 ]
with Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. So [ 700 ] from our [ 1.9 billion ], and that includes exploration.
And then obviously, I just always have to point out with Phase 2 comes on, we're picking up at $60 Brent
that $1 billion of additional cash flow there. So -- and then Bakken, obviously, we're going to pick up some
additional cash flow as well from the higher production.

David Martin Heikkinen
Pickering Energy Partners Insights

And that's before a potential fourth rig in the Bakken that would get you up to 200,000 barrels equivalent
a day?
