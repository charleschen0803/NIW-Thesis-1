ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to the Robert Half Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call.

Our host for today's call are Mr. Keith Waddell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Robert Half; and
Mr. Michael Buckley, Chief Financial Officer.

Mr. Waddell, you may begin.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Hello, everyone. We appreciate your time today.

Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that the comments made on today's call contain forward-
looking statements including predictions and estimates about our future performance. These statements
represent our current judgment of what the future holds. However, they are subject to the risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. These
risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed
with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call.

During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. In reference to these
figures as adjusted, reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a
supplemental schedule to our earnings press release. In addition, we have modified our presentation
of revenues and the related growth rates for Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology and
Robert Half Management Resources to include their intersegment revenues from services provided to
Protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. This is how we
measure and manage these divisions internally, and from now on, it's how we'll report them externally.
The combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. For
your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the investor center of our website,
roberthalf.com.

We're very pleased that third quarter and early October results reflect consistent weekly and monthly
sequential gains across our divisions. Protiviti had another outstanding quarter reporting its 12th
consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains, leveraging a strong pipeline of diversified service
offerings including particularly robust growth with the blended solutions with our staffing operations. We're
also pleased with the quarter-on-quarter growth in our staffing divisions led by a permanent placement
and OfficeTeam divisions.

2020 continues to be an unprecedented year. I'm extremely proud of the resourcefulness and commitment
exhibited by all of our employees as we maintain high levels of service to our clients and candidates.

Company-wide revenues were $1.19 billion in the third quarter of 2020, down 23% from last year's
third quarter on a reported basis and down 24% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in
the third quarter was $0.67 and compared to $1.01 in the third quarter a year ago. Cash flow from
operations during the quarter was $139 million. The capital expenditures were $7 million. In September,
we distributed a $0.34 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of
$38 million. We also acquired approximately 450,000 shares during the quarter for $24 million. We have
1 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan. Return on
invested capital for the company was 25.8% in the third quarter.

Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Thank you, Keith, and hello, everyone.

Let's start with revenues. As Keith noted, global revenues were $1.190 billion in the third quarter. This is
a decrease of 23% from the third quarter 1 year ago on a reported basis and a decrease of 24% on an as-
adjusted basis. Also on an as-adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were down 31% year-over-
year. U.S. staffing revenues were $666 million, down 32% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing revenues
were $203 million, down 29% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 326 staffing locations
worldwide including 88 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.

In the third quarter, there were 64.3 billing days compared to 64.1 billing days in the third quarter 1
year ago. The current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, equivalent to the fourth quarter of 1 year ago.
Currency exchange rate movements during the third quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-
over-year staffing revenues by $4 million. This increased our year-over-year reported staffing revenue
growth rate by 0.3 percentage points.

Now let's take a closer look at the results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the third quarter were $321
million, $260 million of that is from business within the United States and $61 million is from operations
outside the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global third quarter Protiviti revenues were up 6%
versus the year ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 10%. Non-U.S. revenues were down 8% on an
as-adjusted basis.

Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million and increasing
its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. Protiviti, and its independently owned
member firms, serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.

During the quarter, we changed our presentation of sales and general -- of SG&A expenses to exclude
gains and losses on investments held to fund our obligations under employee deferred compensation
plans. Under these plans, employees direct the investments of their account balances, and the company
makes cash deposits into an investment trust consistent with these directions. As realized and unrealized
investment gains and losses occur, the company's deferred compensation obligation to employees changes
accordingly. However, the value of the related investment trust assets also changes by an equal and
offsetting amount, leaving no net cost to the company. Going forward, changes to the company's deferred
compensation obligations noted above will continue to be included in SG&A, or in the case of Protiviti,
direct cost. However, the offsetting changes in the investment trust assets will be presented separately
below SG&A and outside of operating income. This does not change the reported level of pretax or after-
tax income or cash flows provided -- previously provided.

Going forward, we will replace the discussion of consolidated operating income with the non-GAAP
measure of combined segment income. This will be calculated as consolidated income before income taxes
adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.

Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consulting staffing operations, third quarter gross
margin was 37.5% of applicable revenues compared to 37.9% of applicable revenues in the third quarter
1 year ago. The year-over-year decline in gross margin percentage is primarily due to lower conversion
revenues. Our permanent placement revenues in the third quarter were 10% of consolidated staffing
revenues versus 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined
with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin decreased 80 basis points
compared to the year ago third period to 43.8%.

For Protiviti, gross margin was $87 million in the third quarter or 27.1% of Protiviti revenues. This includes
$3.4 million or 1.1% of Protiviti revenues of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the
underlying trust investment accounts. One year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $88 million or 29.4%
of Protiviti revenues including $200,000 of deferred compensation expense related to investment trust
activities.

Company-wide SG&A costs were 32.8% of global revenues in the third quarter compared to 31.2% in
the same quarter 1 year ago. Deferred compensation expenses related to increases in underlying trust
investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 1.9% in the current third

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

quarter and 0.1% in the same quarter 1 year ago. Staffing SG&A costs were 40.2% of staffing revenues in
the third quarter versus 34.8% in the third quarter of 2019. Included in staffing SG&A costs was deferred
compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 2.6% and 0.1%,
respectively. The increase in staffing SG&A as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of continued
negative leverage resulting from the decline in revenues. Third quarter SG&A cost for Protiviti were 13%
of Protiviti revenues compared to 16.2% of revenues in the year ago period.

Operating income for the quarter was $77 million. This includes $26 million of deferred compensation
expense related to increases in the underlying investment trust assets. Combined segment income was
therefore $103 million in the third quarter. Combined segment margin was 8.6%. Third quarter segment
income from our staffing divisions was $54 million, with a segment margin of 6.2%. Segment income for
Protiviti in the third quarter was $49 million with a segment margin of 15.2%.

Our third quarter tax rate was 26% compared to 28% a year ago. The lower third quarter tax rate is
primarily due to annual adjustments made to reconcile our tax accounts to prior year's tax returns as
actually filed. Our 9-month year-over-year tax rate of 28% is in line with what we expect for the full year.

Moving on to accounts receivable. At the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $690 million
and implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 52.3 days.

Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw
in the third quarter and so far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and
consultant staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues down 29.3% versus the
prior year compared to a 30.7% decrease for the full quarter. Revenues in the first 2 weeks of October
were down 27% compared to the same period 1 year ago.

Permanent placement revenues in September were down 30.1% versus September of 2019. This
compares to a 35.7% decrease for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement
revenues were down 31% compared to the same period in 2019. We provide this information so that you
have insight into some of the trends we saw during the quarter and into October. But as you know, these
are very brief time periods. We caution against reading too much into them.

With that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues of $1.155 billion to $1.255
billion; income per share, $0.55 to $0.75. The midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue
decline of 22% on an as-adjusted basis inclusive of Protiviti.

The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these assumptions are as follows: revenue
growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing down 27% to 30%; Protiviti, up 5% to 7%; overall, down 21%
to 23%. On the gross margin percentages, temporary and consulting staffing, 37% to 38%; Protiviti,
27% to 29%; overall, 39% to 40%. SG&A as a percentage of revenues, excluding deferred compensation
investment impacts, staffing, 36% to 38%; Protiviti, 14% to 16%; overall, 30% to 32%. Segment income,
staffing, 6% to 8%; Protiviti, 12% to 15%; overall, 8% to 10%.

We expect our tax rate to be between 27% and 29%, and shares to be 113 million. We limit our guidance
to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press
release and in the SEC filings.

Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

So thank you, Mike.

As is evidenced in the growth of our newly reported intersegment revenues, the partnership between
Protiviti and our staffing operations continues to be an accelerating source of growth for our enterprise.
We've also seen particular strength in our services to the public sector and financial service clients. In
addition, we've experienced increased demand for services and solutions in cloud technology, online

security, data privacy and digital transformation as enterprise client companies have continued to
strategically invest in these areas.

The significant reductions we made to our cost structure in the second quarter have also benefited the
third quarter and will continue to benefit future quarters. Remote and hybrid working models will continue
long after the pandemic ceases to require them. Access to talent is no longer limited to time zones or
geographies. With our global network of talent and world-class technology tools, we can provide the right
match for clients and candidates regardless of location.

While uncertainty remains in the overall economic environment as the pandemic continues, there's much
to be optimistic about. As the fourth quarter progresses, the nature, timing and amount of any additional
fiscal stimulus should be known. Medical solutions to the COVID-19 virus move ever closer to reality, and
the NFIB continues to report improving trends in the small business community. A recent study showed
that more than half of small businesses are hiring or trying to hire, with the vast majority reporting few or
no qualified applicants.

We continue to believe in our positioning for future growth with the unique strengths of our brands,
people, technology and professional business model.
Now Mike and I would be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.

Andrew Charles Steinerman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Keith, it's a big-picture question about small businesses, and surely, I follow NFIB, just like you've
suggested, these favorable trends reported there. Kind of going through this recession, I was worried
about Robert Half's dependence on small- and medium-sized businesses, and maybe it's about the types
of small and medium-size businesses that you serve. I'm assuming you're not serving a lot of restaurants.

My question is, do you agree with the trends that NFIB are suggesting that they've really kind of made it
through this recession favorably? Do you think it's really dependent on more stimulus for them? And how
are your small- and medium-sized business customers feeling?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

So we would definitely agree that the trends are improving, but as you started, it's also true that SMB
clients are more nimble than mid- and large-cap companies. They cut more, and they've added back more
conservatively. That's very apparent in our own numbers. We've talked in the past that about 80% of our
business is SMB, which we define, by the way, 50 to 100 employees on average. And 20% is mid-cap, mid
to large, mostly mid. That has actually changed during the post-pandemic period such that the mid-cap
number is almost 30%. Clearly, our mid-cap and larger clients have been more resilient than have been
our SMB clients, but we are encouraged.

If you look at our weekly trends beginning in early June, they have consistently improved, and in fact,
we've seen accelerating monthly sequential growth during the quarter. We expect that to carry over into
Q4 with one big caveat. It's been widely reported that most companies' employees have not taken their
paid time off so far this year. That's true at Robert Half. That's true with many of our client companies. We,
therefore, think December will be more holiday impacted -- holiday/paid time off impacted.

We'll have less plant capacity as our employees take that time off. Our clients will have less plant capacity
to close deals. So we're expecting a bigger-than-normal December impact. But that said, adjusted for
that, we do feel good about the progression of our SMB clients, which is now 70% of the total. And history
shows that once they do get comfortable, which we would define as probably closer to the post-pandemic
period, that will participate in an outsized way going forward. And yes, we do think the stimulus would be
helpful, and hopefully, that gets resolved, pre or post the election.

Andrew Charles Steinerman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Perfect. And just to make sure I got the point right, the December holiday effect, that is already included
in the midpoint of your fourth quarter guide, right?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

That's correct.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Robert W. Baird & Co.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the differences that you're seeing with regards to
the needs for finance and accounting professionals, between what you're seeing on the Accountemps
side versus Protiviti. We've had some discussions with some investors who are concerned that maybe
accounting isn't going to come back strongly. Obviously, on the Protiviti side, you're clearly doing very,
very well there, but I'm wondering if you could compare and contrast, and how we should think about it as
we start coming out of this downturn when we eventually do have a vaccine.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

And so at a high level, finance and accounting, particularly at the Accountemps level, has staff accounting
positions that are very transactional or volume driven. And as our clients' volume levels and transaction
levels are down, so is that business. That's no different than every downturn we've been through. And
as you know, I've been here over 30 years. So we fully expect as transaction volumes to improve,
Accountemps will participate nicely there.

I'll also say that what transaction volume there is, generally speaking, those type of positions are less
conducive to remote work than the project-driven positions, which also impacts Accountemps negatively
relative to Protiviti and/or Management Resources. Protiviti has been doing great. As we've talked about, it
has multiple service offerings due to its diversification efforts. For the first time ever, technology consulting
within Protiviti is the largest practice area, which I think is incredible. So they've done well in their
technology consulting. They've done well with risk and compliance, particularly in financial services.

We've talked about anti-money laundering. We've talked about credit risk, enforcement actions that
they're involved with certain of their clients. And then while internal audit at Protiviti is somewhat
impacted, it's not as impacted as the transaction-driven Accountemps-type positions. So we're very
optimistic about how Accountemps will participate when things get more back to normal from a COVID
standpoint.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

That's terrific. And can you talk a little bit about your stance with regards to how much excess capacity
you have currently and how you're thinking about potential additions or subtractions with regards to
internal personnel or some chatter going on with regards to what your internal hiring profile is like. And so
I'm wondering if you could clarify that.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. And so first of all, I'd say, if you compare the first quarter, so let's call that pre-pandemic, with the
third quarter, our revenues are down 21%, and our income's down 21%. And so quite frankly, I think it's
pretty incredible that given the type of impacts COVID had, that we effectively got through that with no
net negative leverage principally because we aggressively cut our costs. We're cautiously optimistic that
when we get that 20% revenue back that we'll do better, and we'll actually leverage in a positive way.

Our current workforce is more tenured because our less-tenured workforce is the piece of the workforce
that we had to part ways with. We are very focused on the productivity levels of our internal staff. We
have better data to measure that. We have very consistent buy-in internally across the organization.
Frankly, our people internally make more money as we let their productivities rise versus adding more
people, such if you got, you're spreading your revenues over more people. They're more profitable if you
spread it over fewer.

So we have very good internal alignment that we're going to let our productivity levels drive up which will
be good for their individual profitability and will be good for our corporate profitability. But we're optimistic
we're going to do better on the next 20% up than we did on the 20% down. Having said that, again, we
are super pleased that 20% down at the top line, no more than 20% down at the bottom line.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Just a follow-up on that answer to Mark's last question. Are you starting to ramp up internal hiring on a
net basis? And if not, what do you need to see to start doing that?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, because -- we're talking staffing now.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Yes.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Because we think we have a lot of unused capacity with the more tenured staff that we currently have, we
don't think we need to do much hiring in the short term. We've got to replace turnover. And by and large,
we've done that largely with furloughs, but that's pretty much all behind us now. So if you're looking at
our job postings online to some indication as to our level of confidence in the future, I would say don't,
because we're happy with the staffing levels we have, and we're happy that there's inherent upside in
their productivity levels, particularly 10-year adjusted which is the best it's ever been.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

All right. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And this question -- the second question might be for Mike.
Regarding the change in the SG&A presentation, I'm just curious why now. Is it because of the volatility
that you might have seen in these trust assets? And if you can give us some color on that, I'd appreciate
it.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

So let me talk at 50,000 feet, and then Mike can be more practical. So first of all, I understand we've had
these plans for over 10 years. Understand, we've got over 2,300 participants. As we said earlier, as Mike
said earlier, it doesn't impact -- earnings doesn't impact cash flow. We have disclosed these numbers in
our footnotes. We've got no net cost. There's no net economic cost from doing this. And the simple answer
for why now is because the SEC believes it's more appropriate that the -- take one side of the equation
out of SG&A and make it its own line item. By simply putting those 2 line items together, you have the
same SG&A that you typically had or that you used to have.

I mean, one, oversimplified way of thinking about this is that we have to mark-to-market every quarter
our obligation to employees under these plans, and we also have to mark-to-market the underlying
assets. And the mark-to-market adjustment for both of those is exactly the same thing in opposite
amounts. In opposite directions, the same amount. So economically, it's 0. And we've had this forever,
10-plus years. And the short answer, again, the SEC has asked us going forward to take what we had put
in our footnotes and instead, put it on the face of the income statement. And that was the only thing I
would…

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So just I understand -- sorry, go ahead.

Vice Chairman, President & CEO

It has been disclosed in the footnotes, and so it's really just a geography movement.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Got it. And so the presentation that we see in this quarter's press release is the same presentation we're
going to be seeing going forward. Is that correct? Or is there something different?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

It's just what you're seeing. And we'll do our best to help you get back to -- we'll do our best to help you
not have to change your model because if you look on the face of the income statement that's attached
to the press release, there's 2 rows right next to each other. And if you put those 2 together, you'll have
exactly the same SG&A you would have gotten historically. We can't tell you to do that, but we could
suggest if you did that, that the combination of 2 rows would be exactly the same as the SG&A you've had
traditionally in your model.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Keith, my first question was just -- you talked about the work from home, virtual world, your talent can go
beyond, I guess, where they're geographically located. And I agree with that high level, and I would think
that the flexibility with the larger firms probably benefits from that. But I was just curious with your SMB
clients, are you seeing that? Like is the smaller 50- to 100-person shop willing to hire someone across the
country?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, and so there's -- suddenly, there's 2 different questions here. One is remote versus on-site. And the
remote could be in the same geography, it's not just in the office. And then there's remote as in a different
geography altogether. And I'd say, clearly, SMB has shown that they're willing to have not on-premise but
largely in the same local geography, whereas bigger businesses, not only are amenable to that, they're
also amenable to -- particularly for project work going outside the local market.

But we've been very pleased that -- depending on the line of business that you're talking, sometimes
70%, 80% of the people we have on assignment are not working in the client's premises. They're working
remotely either in the same geography or in a distant geography.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Got it. And maybe just on Protiviti, can you give us a flavor of kind of where the engagements are the
strongest, like which areas are you seeing the growth and maybe which areas are either idle or declining
right now?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the area where they're the strongest and frankly, the area that we're probably really proud, is the
joint success Protiviti and staffing are having in the public sector. We've got joint pursuit teams selling the
work. By and large, the resources get provided by staffing but Protiviti manages them. If you think about
it, process management, process optimization is right in Protiviti's wheelhouse. In fact, it's the wheelhouse
of their wheelhouse.

If you look at states, they're overwhelmed with volumes and unemployment claims, eligibility for
unemployment payments, processing, they're dealing with housing assistance claims, their call-in volumes
are off the charts. And additionally, you've got school districts that can't keep up with the technical
support requirements of all the virtual learning models. So the public sector has made a meaningful
difference to both staffing and Protiviti this quarter.

You'll notice in the schedules attached to the press release for the first time ever, we've actually shown
you how much revenue is built by staffing to Protiviti. We've shown you the growth rate. And we're
pleased to report that for this quarter, staffing's revenue from Protiviti grew by 28% year-on-year, and
public sector activities were a big piece of that.

That said, that's not the total picture. The strongest part of Protiviti at the moment is technology
consulting, it's cyber, it's cloud, it's transformation, but also risk and compliance, anti-money laundering,
the retail operational risk. All those are strong as well. So Protiviti, very well, very good. The internal audit
has been a little impacted. More discretion in client budgets. There's some fee pressure there. It's down
8% or 10%, while everything up is up even more than that to get to where you see it overall.

And as I said last quarter, remember, Protiviti's fees are actually up more than their revenues because
they've got less reimbursable expenses because they're not traveling. And if you look at a fee level
versus a revenue level, you can add another 4 percentage points to that. So Protiviti, doing very well, and
Protiviti together with staffing, doing very well as well. And we actually show you that both in numbers
and in growth rate percentages in the schedules that we attached to the press release.

Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Could you just give us a quick update on what the bill/pay
spread was in the quarter? And maybe you can even give us a sense how that trended throughout the
quarter and into the first few weeks of October.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the -- so adjusted for mix, to get apples and apples, the bill/pay rates were up 3%, and that's versus
5% a quarter ago and 6% the quarter before that. So not surprisingly, given the overall environment,
there's some pressure on our bill rates but we're still increasing them. And as you know, this all starts with
the pay rates we have to attract the right talent to a given client's assignment.

Mario J. Cortellacci
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And then on -- I guess, historically perm has increased faster than temp. And I guess you're
starting to see that now already. But I'm just curious to know, because of how extreme and unique the
situation is, do you see anything different about this cycle that could cause maybe the temp's portion of
that rebound to lag a little more? I know that we've had, obviously, an early V-shape recovery. But since
June, I feel like the economy has just had a slower pace of improvement. So I need to know if, given the
dynamic you're seeing with SMBs and your mid-cap customers, and then also this, like I said, this V-shape
followed by slower pace could maybe drag out the temp portion of the rebound longer than it normally
would in a regular recession.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

And the short answer would be, we don't think so. It's true, perm has recovered well off the trough, not
unusual. Many of our clients cut too deep and as they need staff, they come to us. They're upgrading

staff including out-of-market remote resources that they haven't done before. But also remember, they're
coming off a lower trough than is the case for temp, all of which is normal.

So I would say, based on everything we've seen so far, the relationship of temp versus perm, there's
very little surprises us. OfficeTeam actually rebounded nicely off their trough because they're actually
participating disproportionately in this public sector work that I talked about earlier. And call centers are a
big part of the demand from the states for the reasons that I talked about.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Crédit Suisse.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Keith, you talked about furloughs a little bit, but any sense of how that dynamic has been playing out in
this recovery, whether it's internal Robert Half, or just as you're kind of maneuvering through the furlough
process as opposed to perm. Because it seems like the perm's coming a little bit stronger than what you
would have expected given how aggressive firms were with furloughs this cycle.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, a, I think furloughs have largely played their way out in a major way given we're several months
from when those people were furloughed. And I'd also say, if you look to peak to trough, perm fell a
little less than it would traditionally. So there's no evidence that furloughs impacted that. And that's --
and further, from the trough, perm is coming back nicely as you observed. And so as we talked about
extensively on the last call, I don't think furloughs are having any meaningful negative effect on the
demand for our services.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Got it. And then just to follow-up on the wage, Keith, is any of that -- is it just the environment we're in?
Or is any of that maybe just the sourcing of candidates from a wider spread geographically than you would
historically see? I guess, said another way, you're going to maybe more cost-efficient regions? Is that
pressing the wage rate at all?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

I would say, generally speaking, we started this disruption period with tighter unemployment than ever,
and so you started from a very strong place. And further, because it's event driven, I think, by and large,
clients see the end of the tunnel more clearly than they typically would. And the fact that it happened
more quickly than in prior downturns, where there's like water torture over 18 months, this happened
over a few. I think all of those are relevant to this business about what happens to pay rates and what
happens to bill rates. But the pay rates are not up as much as they were, but they're still up. Bill rates
are not up as much as they were, but they're still up. While it might be impacted a little bit by the remote
work phenomenon, by and large, I don't think that's the driver.

Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So I just wanted to ask, within the temp staffing business, when we look at the subsegments, the
technology and management resources, obviously, the growth rate deteriorating from last quarter. Is that
just sort of the lag typically we see with professional, maybe longer engagements took a while to roll off?

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 22, 2020

And -- or is there anything else you'd point to? And is it fair to say that those 2 businesses have also seen
the trend of week-to-week revenue improvement that you discussed earlier?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

And so as you observed, the Blackstar -- assignment links are longer in management resources in tech.
And so they had in-flight assignments that they rode longer than our other divisions had meaning they
were impacted later. Happy to report that once they got to that period, they have begun to improve week-
to-week although it was a bit later than early June. They have had several weeks of consistent growth as
well.

The other thing that I talked about earlier was that because they're focused more on project work and
transactional work, project work is more remote friendly than transactional work. So that if you look
cumulatively at kind of peak to trough during pandemic of our Accountemps, OfficeTeam and you compare
that to Management Resources tech, there's less impact to Management Resources tech than there is to
the former because of the project work. And it seems to be more resilient than the transaction, partly
because it's more remote friendly.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. And then within the cost reductions that you've delivered, particularly at the
SG&A level, interesting to me that Protiviti, which is doing -- holding up better and continuing to grow,
has seen pretty similar, in fact, it looks like more larger percentage than a temp reduction in SG&A. Was
there anything in particular to the quarter? And I guess how should we think about that trending? I know
you commented on next quarter a bit, but trending over the next few quarters or anything you'd point out
there.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, first of all, remember that Protiviti's principal payroll costs are in direct costs not in SG&A. But for
those costs that are in SG&A, I think they've certainly been -- because there's less travel overall, including
nonbillable travel, that's a factor. They reduced their marketing cost just because of the impacts primarily
to their internal audit practice during the year. Having said that, if you'll notice for the fourth quarter,
we are calling for their SG&A costs to increase, and that's driven by the same reasons they're going to
turn to marketing spigot back on, and they've got some training costs attached to all the people that
they've added. But Protiviti's profitability for 2020 -- calendar 2020 will be the largest it's been in many,
many years, which in and of itself is also incredible. So they're growing the fastest, and they're the most
profitable of any of our lines of business, which is a really good place to be.

Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from Truist Securities.

Jasper James Bibb
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

This is Jasper Bibb filling in for Tobey. I was hoping you could speak to what you've been hearing from
customers kind of regarding re-shoring or onshoring of outsourced labor and what that might mean for
your business.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

We hear a little bit of it, primarily on the Protiviti side. I wouldn't say it's a major theme or trend. But
clearly, some companies aren't happy to have a heavily reliance on their supply chain offshore and they're
bringing some of that back. And so again, we have a few engagements, but it's not moving the needle.

Jasper James Bibb
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

And then as volumes kind of coming back here, I was hoping you could speak to what you're hearing from
clients on kind of the split between flexible and perm labor needs. And whether that dynamic might vary
from what you've seen in kind of the early stages of prior cycles.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, which is always the case. And in prior cycles, most of our very nimble SMB clients get really lean
during the downturn, and at the first hint of optimism and more transaction volume, they need help.
And frankly, if you look for the last couple of downturns and recoveries thereafter, temp and perm have
recovered pretty much together because perm has a deeper trough. It typically has higher growth rates
coming out of that trough. But by and large, just economic incentives to keep your cost variable are just
as true at the beginning of a recovery as they are any other time. On the other hand, to the extent they
overcut or got extra lean and want to take advantage of one of the best labor markets they're going to see
because it's early in a recovery. Many of them choose to tap into that market and upgrade their talent. So
frankly, we don't see anything different in impact of downturn, early stages of recovery that different than
in the past, other than it was condensed into a much smaller time frame.

Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

The temp staffing gross margins contracted 40 bps year-over-year due to lower conversion revenues for
the most part. Can you talk about how you expect the recent slowdown in temp wage growth to impact
temp bill/pay spreads?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, first of all, I'm glad you mentioned temp gross margins because, frankly, it's one of the things we're
most proud of and how we've managed during the pandemic period. Typically peak to trough during a
downturn, we'd be down 300 basis points in our temp gross margins. And as we stand here now, we're
significantly less than that, meaning we've done significantly better. As to slowing temp wage growth,
that's not going to have much impact on our spread because we're going to take to the extent there are
lower temp wages in an absolute way. We're going to take that amount and apply the same margin to it
that we would otherwise. So compression with wage growth doesn't mean compression in margin.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then I wanted to dive into your assumptions around your 4Q guide. Can you
elaborate on what you're assuming with COVID infection rates and lockdowns and your outlook?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the assumption is that just like it's been the case in the last few months, there are going to be ebbs
and flows. There are going to be hotspots. There's going to be partial lockdowns, partial restrictions. It's
just all part of the calculus. And that that's a reason why we only have modest sequential growth in the
midpoint of our guide. It doesn't assume a major country complete shutdown and does assume that there
will continue to be ebbs and flows.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Just had one quick follow-up. Keith and Mike, you've talked about the public sector. And I was wondering if
you could talk about to what extent your -- that has plateaued? Or if you're seeing continued growth? And
how long you think those projects are going to go on for. It certainly seems like given how far behind the
public sector is, that it would continue for a while. But I'd love to hear your perspective.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, clearly, some of the current demand is bulge demand because of unemployment rates because of
need for housing assistance. There's no question that there's a bulge component to it, but we believe
we're building relationships for the first time ever that are going to have legs as we go forward. And as I
said earlier, Protiviti loves to show up when process optimization is the objective. And for many of these
state and local governments, their processes, could use some optimization. And we believe that lives past
this bulge period. But the bulge period certainly is nice to have as we bridge ourselves to the other side of
COVID.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Would you use initial unemployment claims as kind of a proxy for that bulge period? And just tracking
that, or how are you thinking about how long the bulge period may last?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, if our penetration rates among the states -- we're only dealing with a handful of states. And so if
we were dealing with every single state, and this surge related primarily to their surge, I would say, yes.
But the fact that we're continuing to go to new states, and referencing the states where we already are,
that itself is a source of growth such that we're growing share, if you will, in addition to just the surge in
unemployment and housing assistance claims.

Okay. That was our last question. Thank you very much for joining us.
