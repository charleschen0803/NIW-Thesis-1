MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Microchip's Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Financial Results
Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please begin.

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making
projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial
performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions, and that actual
events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent
filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of
operations.

In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy,
Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal year 2020 financial performance,
and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results and discuss the current business
environment as well as our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst
questions.

We are including information in our press release and -- in this conference call on various GAAP and non-
GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of
our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and
non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on
our website.

I want to remind investors that during the June quarter of 2018, we adopted the new GAAP revenue
recognition standard, which requires revenue to be recognized at the time products are sold to distributors
versus our historical revenue recognition policy, where revenue on such transactions were deferred
until the product was sold by our distributors to an end customer. As discussed in previous earnings
conference call, we continue to track and measure our performance internally based on direct revenue
plus distribution sell-through activity. And each quarter, we'll provide a metric for this called end-market
demand in our earnings release. Therefore, along with our GAAP and non-GAAP results, based on
distribution sell-in, we will also provide investors with our end-market demand based on distribution sell-
out, but will not provide a P&L based on end-market demand. End-market demand in the December 2019
quarter was $1.324 billion, end-market demand was about $36.1 million more than our GAAP revenue in
the December 2019 quarter.

I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating
expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, which is based on expenses prior to the
effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described
in our press release.

Net sales in the December quarter were $1.287 billion, which was down 3.76% sequentially and near
the high end of our updated revenue guidance provided on January 6, 2020. We have posted a summary
of our GAAP net sales and end-market demand by product line and geography on our website for your
reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 61.5%, operating expenses were 26.4%, and
operating income was 35.1% and above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $340.8
million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.32, which was above the high end of our last
provided non-GAAP EPS guidance from December 3, 2019 of $1.30.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 61% and include the impact of $5.7 million of share-based
compensation expense. Total operating expenses were $654.3 million and include acquisition intangible
amortization of $248.7 million, special charges of $17.8 million, $10.9 million of acquisition-related and
other costs and share-based compensation of $37.8 million. The GAAP net income was $311.1 million or
$1.20 per diluted share. Our December quarter of GAAP tax benefit was significantly positively impacted
by the tax benefit related to the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. The non-GAAP
cash tax rate was 6% in the December quarter. We expect our non-GAAP cash tax rate for fiscal '20 to
be about 6%, exclusive of any transition tax, any potential tax associated with the restructuring of the
Microsemi operations and the Microchip's global structure and any tax audit settlements related to taxes
accrued in prior fiscal years.

We have many tax attributes and net operating losses and tax credits as well as U.S. interest deductions
that we believe will keep our cash tax payments low. The future cash tax payments associated with the
transition tax is expected to be about $245 million and will be paid over the next 6 years. We have posted
a schedule of our projected transition tax payments on the Investor Relations page of our website.

Our inventory balance at December 31, 2019, was $708.8 million. We had 129 days of inventory at the
end of the December quarter, down 2 days from the prior quarter's level. Inventory at our distributors in
the December quarter were at 28 days compared to 30 days at the end of September. We've only had 1
quarter in the past 15 years, which was Q3 of fiscal year 2013, where our days of inventory at distribution
have been at lower than the current levels.

The cash flow from operating activities was $395.5 million in the December quarter. As of December 31,
the consolidated cash and total investment position was $402.3 million. We paid down $257 million of total
debt in the December quarter, and the net debt on the balance sheet was reduced by $254.2 million.

Over the last 6 full quarters since we closed the Microsemi acquisition and incurred over $8 billion in debt
to do so, we have paid down $1.986 billion of the debt and continue to allocate substantially all of our
excess cash generation beyond dividends to aggressively bring down this debt. We have accomplished this
despite the adverse macro and market conditions during most of this period, which we feel is a testimony
to the cash generation capabilities of our business. We expect our debt levels to reduce significantly over
the next several years.

Our adjusted EBITDA in the December quarter was $503.4 million, and our trailing 12-month adjusted
EBITDA was $2.125 billion. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding our very long-dated convertible
debt that matures in 2037 and is more equity-like in nature, was 4.58 at December 31, 2019. Our
dividend payment in the December quarter was $87.7 million. Capital expenditures were $14.1 million
in the December 2019 quarter. We expect between $20 million and $25 million in capital spending in the
March quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to be between $76 million and $81 million.

We continue to add capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products
and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently
outsourced. We expect these capital investments will bring some gross margin improvement to our
business, particularly for the outsourced Atmel and Microsemi manufacturing activities that we are
bringing into our own factories.

Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $41.4 million.

I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the
December quarter. Ganesh?

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to remind you that the
product line comparisons I will be sharing with you today are based on end-market demand, which is how
Microchip measures its performance internally.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Let's start by taking a closer look at microcontrollers. Our microcontroller business was sequentially down
1.1% as compared to the September quarter. We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative
new microcontrollers, including next-generation Bluetooth 5.0 dual-mode audio solutions, production-
ready open source tools for managing our Adaptec Smart Storage offerings and industry support for
development of the Open Compute Project's Accelerator Infrastructure through our PCIe switches.
Microcontrollers represented 53.6% of our end-market demand in the December quarter.

Moving to analog. Our analog business was sequentially down 3.6% as compared to the September
quarter. During the quarter, we continued to introduce a steady stream of innovative analog products,
including the IEEE 802.3bt-compliant power over Ethernet injectors and midspans that enable up to 90
watts of power without changing switches or cable. Analog represented 28.1% of our end-market demand
in the December quarter.

Our FPGA business was sequentially flat as compared to the September quarter. During the quarter, we
introduced a radiation-tolerant Polarfire FPGA for space and other high-reliability applications as well
as the early access program for the Polarfire system-on-chip FPGA, offering the world's first hardened
real-time Linux-capable, risk-five based microprocessor subsystem. Design wins for the Polarfire family
continued to grow strongly, and we remain optimistic about the prospects for this product family. FPGA
represented 6.9% for end-market demand in the December quarter.

Our licensing, memory and other product line, which we refer to as LMO, was sequentially down 0.7%
as compared to the September quarter. During the quarter, we enable -- we delivered a new family of
electrically erasable RAM products, providing cost-effective alternatives to nonvolatile RAM solutions and
a number of memory densities. LMO represented 11.3% of our end-market demand in the December
quarter.

An update regarding coronavirus and what we're seeing. First, all our employees are safe, and what
remains -- and that remains our highest priority. We implemented travel bans in and out of China, Hong
Kong and Taiwan 2 weeks ago. We also implemented self-quarantine requirements for anyone who may
have traveled to these countries, mandatory medical assessment and clearance for anyone who may have
symptoms, a screening questionnaire for all external visitors to any Microchip facility and common sense
preventive sanitizing steps on a continuous basis in all our facilities worldwide.

As you well know, most provinces in China have extended the Chinese New Year holidays to February 9,
Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, has extended the holidays to February 13.

Our manufacturing footprint in China is small, and we expect little impact to our operations from this
extension. Also at this time, we do not anticipate any significant supply chain issues for materials
sourced from China. Some of our customers would -- could be affected by the extended Chinese New
Year holidays. It is too early to determine what impact there may be as most are not yet back from
the extended holidays. Because Chinese New Year this year was early in the quarter, there is more
time for our customers to catch up lost production within the quarter. We also believe there is slack in
manufacturing capacity, which can be of help while recovering lost production. These outbreaks are
unpredictable, and there may yet be other twists and turns to come in the days ahead. We continue to
process the news daily as well as monitor information from the center for disease control and the World
Health organization. We will adapt our response as needed and focus on the things that we can control.

Finally, over the last few months, we started to share 6 megatrends that we believe provide significant
growth opportunities for Microchip over the next 5 to 10 years, and I'd like to summarize them.

First, the 5G infrastructure rollout, which is just getting started and has a decade ahead of it. Each prior
generation of wireless infrastructure deployment, 2G, 3G and 4G, lasted for about 10 years. The Internet
of Things comprised of smart, connected and secured end nodes is picking up steam, especially for
industrial IOT, where there is compelling -- when there are compelling business models for customers to
make money, save money and mitigate risk.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Third, for data centers. The data center demand, the store and process data is exploding as data is
created at a hyper-exponential rate. To put this in perspective, estimates are that 90% of the world's data
was created in just the last 2 years, and that trend continues unabated.

Fourth, electric and hybrid vehicles are writing a wave of consumer and regulatory forces, which are
driving substantial investment in technology and capacity.

Fifth is the Advanced Driver Assist, which is already a growth application and its proliferation to more car
models and its natural progression to increasing levels of autonomous driving.

Sixth is finally the artificial intelligence and machine learning, which we see as another explosive growth
area, not only in the cloud, but even more so at the edge. These megatrends cut across the diverse
end markets we serve and guide our product development priorities. We believe these megatrends, in
conjunction with our total system solutions go-to-market approach, will provide key opportunities for
organic growth in the coming years.

With that, let me pass it to Steve for some comments about our business and our guidance going forward.
Steve?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the
fiscal third quarter of 2020, I will then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020.

Our December quarter was an interesting one in which we revised the midpoint of our guidance upwards
twice. Once on December 3, 2019, prior to the Crédit Suisse conference and second on January 6, 2020,
prior to JPMorgan Conference.

Our final December quarter GAAP net sales were on the high end of our latest guidance and came in at
$1.287 billion, down 3.76% sequentially. Our end-market demand based on sell-through was $36 million
higher than GAAP sales, which we believe shows that the channel was continuing to manage their working
capital conservatively by reducing inventory due to uncertainty. December was the seventh consecutive
quarter where our sell-through revenue was higher than our sell-in revenue.

Our consolidated non-GAAP gross margin of 61.5% was just above the high end of our guidance. Our
consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 35.1% was also just above the high end of our guidance. Our
consolidated non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.32, which was also above the high end of our revised
guidance. So overall, December quarter turned out to be a lot better than originally guided.

On non-GAAP basis, this was also our 117th consecutive profitable quarter. In the December quarter, we
paid down $257 million of our debt. Our total debt payment since the end of June 2018 has been about $2
billion. The pace of debt payments has also -- has been strong despite the weakened uncertain business
conditions, underlining the strong cash-generation characteristics of our business as well as our active
efforts to continue to squeeze working capital efficiencies.

Now before I provide you guidance for the March quarter, let me comment on some of the inflection
points that we saw during the December quarter. Our December quarter bookings were up double-digit
percentage over the September quarter bookings that resulted in our starting backlog for March quarter
to be up double-digit percentage over the starting backlog for the December quarter. Our starting backlog
was up in each of the geographies of North America, Europe and Asia. From an end-market perspective,
we saw strength in data centers and start of a recovery in industrial and automotive.

Continuing on the inflection points, the book-to-bill ratio for December quarter was well above 1 after
multiple quarters of book-to-bill being below 1. Our distributor inventory at the end of September was
already at a low level and lowest in 15 years, except 1 quarter in fiscal year '13. In December quarter, the
distribution inventory went even lower. During December quarter, we saw increased level of customer-
requested pull-ins, many of its required factory expedite.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Seeing these multiple signs of inflection point, we call the December quarter to be a bottom for Microchip
for this cycle, barring any negative developments on the U.S.-China trade front or the impact of
coronavirus.

Now I turn to guidance for March quarter. The backlog from March quarter that started out quite strong
continue to fill in during the month of January. Taking all these factors into consideration and after rolling
up revenue expectations from sales regions as well as business units, we expect GAAP net sales, based on
sell-in revenue recognition for our products, to be up between 2% to 9% sequentially in the March 2020
quarter. The midpoint of our guidance for the March 2020 quarter reflects what we believe our business
can deliver, assuming no extraordinary events. However, the wider-than-normal guidance range is to help
account for the uncertainty associated with the evolving coronavirus situation. We are still in the early
days of how this situation is playing out. We have no way to model how the rest of the quarter will play
out for the coronavirus situation, and what the consequent business impact may be. But we believe that
our guidance range incorporates our best judgment for the possible scenarios.

Regarding CapEx, we expect to finish fiscal year 2020 with a CapEx of between $76 million and $81
million, a significant reduction from fiscal year '19 CapEx of $229 million. This is consistent with what we
have said before that our CapEx is divided between growth capital, maintenance capital and new products
and technology capital in a fiscal year, like 2020, in which our net sales declined, the growth capital, which
is the largest portion of the CapEx, declines to virtually nothing. And therefore, the total CapEx declined
significantly.

For December quarter -- it should be for March quarter. For March quarter, we expect our non-GAAP gross
margin to be between 61.5% and 61.9% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between
25% and 26.2% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit percentage to be between 35.3% and
36.9% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.35 per share to $1.51
per share.

Given all the complications of accounting for our acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles,
restructuring charges and inventory write-up on acquisitions, Microchip will continue to provide guidance
and track its reserves on a non-GAAP basis, except for net sales, which will be on a GAAP basis. We
believe that non-GAAP results provide more meaningful comparison to prior quarters, and we request that
the analysts continue to report their non-GAAP estimates to first call.
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.

Craig Matthew Hettenbach
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Steve, just a question on the expedite activity. Can you just maybe put that into context with currently
kind of where your lead times are and things you're looking to do to maybe kind of address that as
business improves?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So during this down cycle, we built a substantial amount of inventory that is held in the die bank. So
when an order comes in, it's really taking the die from the die bank and processing it through, which
can be anywhere to as low as 3 weeks to as much as 6, 7 weeks, depending on where it has to go inside
or outside or what difficult package or assembly test it might be. What we are finding is that customers
stationed a fair amount of backlog just outside the quarter. And then when they need the product, they
expedite into the quarter. This way, they kind of have both choices. They could not take it in the quarter
and leave it out or push it out further. Or if they need it, ask us to pull it in. We've been seeing this
strange phenomenon now, not only this quarter, we've been seeing it for some time, but it really became
even more accentuated. So there's a fair amount of backlog sitting outside the quarter in April, and
customers are expediting it into the quarter. Does that answer your question?

Craig Matthew Hettenbach
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes.

Operator

Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Steve, I'm curious, what are you expecting your distributors to do in the March quarter? I think you're
giving a net sales outlook. So any color on sell-in and sell-out trends would be helpful. And in general,
what are they saying to you? Why are they taking down Microchip inventory to such low levels because
it's such an outlier, and we don't hear of any of your other peers, their inventory is being taken down to
similarly low levels.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Well, I don't really know if -- as we speak, distributors are taking down inventory further, but they have
in the last 7 quarters or so through December. We don't really have a guidance for the March quarter
on sell-through. We can't really provide both ends of the guidance. It's just too much work. So we're
providing the sell-in guidance that we have given you. And in the December quarter, when we provided
the guidance, we expected that distributors will reverse the trend and will start to build some inventory
towards normalization. It did not happen in December. We're expecting it would happen again in March,
but there's no guarantee. Distributors will do what they will do. I think part of the reason is, for 30
years, a culture at Microchip, in our business unit, sales organization up and down to the change with
the distribution. Our conversations with the distributors are winning designs, creating a large funnel and
pulling those designs to production and creating sales well. That's how we pay our salespeople, that's how
we pay our business units, that's how all the bonuses are structured. And we don't really have a whole lot

9

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

of conversations regarding what we give into the distribution. That has off -- always been less important
to us because we manage our business based on sell-through. So distributors take the inventory what
they want to run their business and based on getting returns for their business. In contrast, I think we
see many of our peers and competitors are more focused on sell-in revenue recognition, where they may
make deals to put more product into distribution and arresting the fall of the inventory that way.

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

I would add one more thing. We've always had low lead times on our products. And I think that gives
distributors an opportunity to run the inventory to whatever the lowest level they think they can get away
with, while continuing to focus on sell-through. So short lead times give them the opportunity to carry less
inventory as well.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

I would also add that sometime we charge expedite charges for expediting the product. So sometime
expedite charges require us to spend weekends, pay overtime or pay expedites for shipping, going
through hand-carry products and all sorts of charging can incur. And we often pass those to the
customers. It doesn't move the needle in terms of revenue. But if somebody wants to expedite the parts,
it's not always free.

Vivek Arya
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

But you're not assuming any restocking benefit, any major restocking benefit in March.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

We have no way to model it.

Operator

Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.

Gary Wade Mobley
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I want to ask about your relative performance in the microcontroller segment. It looks like for the full
calendar year 2019, you outperformed the microcontroller market in terms of sales growth. If you believe
in the SIA sales metrics. But in the second half of the year, it looks like -- in particular, in the fourth
calendar quarter, it looks like you might have underperformed the market. To what should we attribute
that to? Is it -- this is just sort of a short-term disruption or anything to look into there long term?

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

I'm not sure what data is that you're referring to. So we were sequentially down 1.1% on microcontrollers,
September to December. If you look at the year-over-year numbers, we're -- on microcontrollers, we're
down about 5%, 5.5%, somewhere in that neighborhood. The story is not written. We don't see any
annualized numbers that are out yet, maybe SIA has some early numbers. We'll get that by March, April,
and we'll, at the next conference call, have the typical Gartner 2019 numbers. There's nothing in our
business that has any indication that something was better in the first half and got worse in the second
half.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

I think if you look at the third quarter results sequentially and compared it to a very large competitor, I
think we substantially outgrew them. So...

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

Either on quarter or by year-over-year.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Yes.

Operator

Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.

Christopher Caso
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

A question with regard to gross margins, and assuming we are -- have started recovery, we'd hope to see
some gross margin improvement as a result. Perhaps you could answer it in terms of production utilization
levels with some of the better order rates, has that caused you to change any production levels? And then
from a cost standpoint, as we go forward, I think you still have some integration benefits still to come.
Could you help to quantify those, and when they kick in and how it helps leverage, if indeed we're in a
recovery?

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. This is Eric. So in the December quarter, we incurred about a $16 million factory underutilization
charge that was reflected in our cost of sales. That was up about $7 million quarter-on-quarter. We expect
that charge to be lower in the March quarter, particularly in our back-end assembly and test operation,
we're running the factories higher. Steve talked about in an earlier response that our die bank is pretty
healthy. But back-end operations, we've been training, finished goods and looking to run the factories
harder this quarter, which should help on the gross margin and the guidance that we're giving. So that's
a piece of it. We continue to run our factories as efficiently as we can. We're continuing to invest to bring
some of the outsourced assembly and test in-house at a moderate rate, and all those things are going to
benefit gross margin long term and lead us to our long-term guidance, which is to get to about 63% non-
GAAP gross margins as a long-term model versus the 61.7% we're guiding to at the midpoint of guidance
for the current quarter.

Operator

Our next question will come from William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

William Stein
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Similar topic, only not just gross on operating as well. Maybe, Eric, you can take a step back and
frame up relative to where you are now? And contemplating your longer-term goals, what's the path to
getting there? Is it just a modest amount of revenue recovery is mix part of the equation, is there still
restructuring for Microsemi? I know you're still bringing capacity in-house. It seems to us that it seems
fairly likely that you'll be able to exceed these long-term targets, given the revenue level that you're
achieving today relative to what the next peak could be, for example.

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Okay. So I think I've kind of touched on gross margin so far, and we've been told by others that they think
that's a conservative forecast, but we're not going to update that model until we get to the target.

And on OpEx, we're guiding the current quarter to be between 25% and 26.2% of sales, and our long-
term model is 22.5%. I would say we have been pretty conservative in how we've been managing the
business during this current cycle. And with that, we need to make sure that we're making the appropriate
investment, whether it's in R&D, support functions, technical sales, outreach to the customers to make
sure we drive the long-term health of the business and some of our variable compensation programs too
will kick back in as revenue grows. So we have confidence in the long-term model, which is just above
40% operating margins, and we've got ways to go when we're guiding the current quarter at the midpoint
of guidance to about 36.1%. So I'd say be patient, we do need revenue growth to get there. But I think
we're well positioned with the investments that we've made to drive to higher levels than what we're
seeing today.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Financial Group.

Ambrish Srivastava
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Steve, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the source of strength in bookings,
whether end markets or geos. I believe last earnings call, you had indicated that China was stronger in
terms of geos. So any updates on that front would be helpful.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So I think from an end market perspective, we said that data center has been strong all along, and we
are seeing a start of a recovery in the industrial market and the automotive market. The communication
market remains weak, and the appliance market remains weak. And aerospace and defense is going to
always lumpy and it's hard to call.

From a geographical perspective, yes, we saw strength in the China market last quarter, but you would
see the weakness in China market this quarter driven by the Lunar New Year. And you don't -- we --
nobody knows what's going to happen with the coronavirus. So this quarter, you would see stronger U.S.
and Europe and weaker China.

If we think about the seasonality in the business now that we have some time to [indiscernible]. How
do we think about it coming out of the bottom of the cycle and kind of perhaps entering into mid-cycle
recovery, excluding the impact of the coronavirus? I'm just trying to get a sense of the seasonality
[indiscernible] acquisitions post the bottom of the cycle.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

I think Raji, seasonality is still hard to measure where the -- all of the acquisitions that we have
completed. The events that have happened in the last couple of years, the -- all the trade tension
situation, general economic conditions, now the coronavirus. Prior to that, we had a significant inventory
correction event on, especially the Microsemi inventory. We really haven't finished enough quarters in a
healthy business environment to peg a seasonality. So I would think it still remains difficult.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

B. Riley FBR, Inc., Research Division

Congratulations on the good execution. I wanted to go back to some of the comments around the
performance on debt reduction, which, over the last 6 quarters at almost $2 billion, is very strong. The
question is, perhaps, both to you, Eric, and you, Steve. As you look ahead and given the trajectory you're
on, it seems like you could be at a 3x net debt-to-EBITDA level and as soon as 4 quarters or so. So how
do you think about deploying the cash to create value for shareholders when you get to that level, would
a vast majority of available cash will go to debt pay down? Or would you start looking at other things, and
what would the priorities be at that point?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Let me take that, and Eric can add to it. First of all, I don't think I have looked at a model, which will
take the leverage down to 3x in 4 quarters. That seems awfully aggressive. Although I don't know what
assumption you are making in the revenue growth of the recovery, it will largely depend on that. But
basically, yes, we need to bring the debt leverage below 3 handle, kind of have it somewhere in the high
2s. Once we get there, then we'll still be generating somewhere of the order of well over $1 billion of
free cash per quarter, and we need to figure out what we do. I mean we haven't been in that situation
in quite a long time. You have obvious choices. You could pay down more debt and bring leverage down
further. But more preferably, you could increase the dividend. You can start a buyback program. And that
all, assuming that there is not a further M&A possibility. We have said before that we think by the time
we come up for air, majority of the company is the smaller companies that we would like to buy, probably
would have been bought. And there isn't as much more opportunity there, but there could be 1 more
possibly.

But secondly, we think that the remaining assets are very expensive. There is a large amount of M&A
bid on them already because every small companies really on sale. And we don't really pay that kind of
multiple that we have seen paid in the recent deals, Cyprus as well as some of the deals. Those multiples
were way, way too high for our tests. So if we cannot find a reasonable other acquisition, then our focus
will switch to other uses of cash, including higher dividend, more stock buyback and possibly some more
debt pay down.

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

I think what I'm going to add to that is just kind of a short-term view here is -- because I know I'll get
that -- we'll get this question a lot is what do we expect for that pay down in the current quarter, the
March quarter. And really, we expect that to be somewhere between $225 million and $250 million. Last
quarter, it was $257 million. But our starting accounts receivable balance is lower just because revenue
was down last quarter. So really to get some tailwinds behind us. From a revenue perspective, as the top
line grows, I think EBITDA will start growing nicely. And that's going to help with the leverage metrics
coming down, but it kind of depends on what the environment is going to be over the course of the next
year if we were able to get to that 3x number that you mentioned. I think we need some pretty good
revenue growth.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.

Christopher Brett Danely
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

Steve, you mentioned that some customers were expediting orders out of the June quarter into this
quarter. So do you think that the June quarter could be at risk of a little bit of a disappointment, like we're
routing from the June quarter to pay the March quarter? And then further to that, you talked a little bit
about lead times. Do you think that there is risk of extended lead times if this expediting continues?

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

CEO & Chairman

The lead times are not at risk short term because we have a fair amount of die inventory, and there's
a fair amount of capacity slack in the system since the revenues are down year-over-year. The backlog
bottomed out some time ago, and the total extended backlog is really growing nicely. So when people are
taking backlog from June quarter moving into March quarter, that's not putting June quarter at risk. There
is a higher and higher backlog. The overall backlog is growing. Book-to-bill was strongly positive. So it put
a very large amount of total backlog in the system.

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

Chris, we had expedited in the December quarter, where people have placed backlog in the March quarter
and pulled it in. You're seeing a stronger March quarter despite that. So as you go into an up an upward
trend in the business, it is not unnatural. We've seen it in other cycles where customers start to see their
business recovering and wanting to have products sooner than they had originally planned for.

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. And in addition to those orders that are being pulled in by customers requesting them into the current
quarter, we're also receiving orders that are just within our normal published lead times, and that can
create some expedite activity also.

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

Often with short lead times.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Yes. And Chris, this phenomenon is not a new one. We've seen it before in prior cycles, and we've been
seeing it in this cycle. It's -- I kind of call it, have your cake and eat it too. So customers will place an
order, where they are still in the cancellation or push-out window. And if they don't want it, if the business
is not strong, they can push it out or leave it out. But if their business is stronger than they needed, then
they ask us to expedite it, kind of have their cake and eat it too. It's not a new phenomenon. But we are
seeing it quite accentuated right now, and that's why I called it out.

Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.

Harsh V. Kumar

Steve, I was curious with the sudden pickup in China. Are you aware of any areas of shortages, not just in
your business, but in the industry overall?

Stephen Sanghi

I'm not seeing any shortages. I mean, China right now is shutdown. So you really wouldn't get any
data, and they were shut down for the Chinese New Year. They're just about coming back, but most
provinces have extended until February 9. But prior to going for the Chinese New Year, no, I -- we were
not experiencing any shortages.

Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Eric, perhaps asked another way. If you could talk about Atmel and Microsemi, bringing them in-house.
Remind us kind of where we are front end and back end? And then also the gross margin benefits that you
would get there? Also, how you're able to do this in such a small CapEx envelope as well?

James Eric Bjornholt
Senior VP & CFO

Okay. So there's a couple of pieces to that. So we did tighten our investment criteria in terms of making
those capital investments over the course of the last year when business was difficult. And so we shorten
the window, the payback window from a cash flow perspective from 2 years down to a year. And we
really haven't changed that at this point in time. So that's one of the reasons it's been lower. And this is
a very detailed work. So it's package by package, part by part. And none of these investments are needle
movers. But in aggregate, they do help gross margins slowly over time. So I think that's responsive to
your question, unless these guys have anything else they'd like to add.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

I think there's then the percentage we haven't said and outside for fab, assembly and tests.

Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division

Yes. So fab is 39% internal, assembly is 45% and test is 54%.

Harsh V. Kumar

Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

Harlan Sur
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Congrats on the strong start to 2020. I know lead times are still pretty short. But given the strong
bookings trends coming off of the depressed September quarter, strong bookings thus far here in the
March quarter and maybe some backlog build for June, existing out the potential issues for coronavirus.
But do you think you're setting up given the backlog that you're seeing, at least for a seasonal June
quarter, which is typically one of your seasonally strongest quarters.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

We are not giving guidance or commenting on the June quarter, especially in the light of significant
uncertainty because of the coronavirus. Remove those uncertainties and let's say there's no impact and
business comes back and the virus is contained rapidly and all that, then your assessment for the June
quarter would be correct.

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

Yes. And I think I would just add that we are very well positioned from a capacity perspective to be able to
respond quickly to upside if that develops.

Harlan Sur
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And then, I guess, on that note, back in early January when you did your update, it didn't sound
like you were going to be increasing front-end utilizations near-term just because you guys have pretty
substantial die bank. But let's say, as the much quarter progresses and the backlog is indicating the
potential for normal seasonal growth for June and September, I assume the team would start to ramp
capacity utilization, say, in the back half of this quarter. Is that kind of the right way to think about the
potential timing of utilizations going up?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So -- this is Steve. Let me take that. I think let's start from the back end first then we'll come to the front
end. The back-end utilization is going up as we speak. And as we ramp, it will continue to go up because
we depleted the finished goods. And when the orders are strong, we've got to take the die bank and finish
them. So that will continue to have a positive effect on gross margin, pretty much starting now.

When you look at the front end, the front end still has a fair amount of die bank, but there also you got to
separate it on the production we do inside versus the production we buy from outside. The inventory and
the products we buy from outside was depleted to a lower level. And there, we are increasing the buy as
we speak. But there's not a utilization impact of that because that was being done outside. What we were
doing inside, that's where we have the substantial die bank. And I think it will at least take it a few more
quarters before we have to start increasing the production in our fabs.

Harlan Sur
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. Okay. But then the lower end, the underutilization charges here in the March quarter is simply
because you are filling out your packaging and test assembly utilizations are going up, right? Is that the
primary driver for the lower underutilization charges?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

Yes. There's always lots of moving parts, mix and all that. But yes, there is a new phenomenon where
even in the December quarter, we were depleting finished goods. We were a quarter back-end utilization
was lower than the September quarter. And the March quarter will be up significantly from the December
quarter.

I wanted to add one more comment on the question you asked regarding the June quarter seasonality,
how it would be? And the comment was made that June quarter will at least be seasonal. I would say,
I hope that one of these quarters, current quarter as well as June quarter and September quarter are
well above seasonal because the inventories are so low. And if I take any Qs from any prior recoveries,
whether it was from SaaS or the recovery in -- from 2009 cycle or any other cycle recovery, usually, you
got 2 or 3 quarters of well above seasonal recovery that takes the business back to the old heights and
then goes from there. So I'd like to think that any kind of forecast here becomes very conservative.

Harlan Sur
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Yes. I thought that's a fair point, Steve.

I was wondering, as you look at your business, I was wondering if you can give us some color by markets,
in markets, automotive, industrial, how do you see that playing out to the rest of the year?

Ganesh Moorthy

So as Steve mentioned, we're starting to see automotive and industrial picking up from the bottom that
they were at. They had pretty bad years in 2019. And our expectation is that barring any outside events
as we go through 2020, both those end markets should see continued improvement.

Vijay Raghavan Rakesh
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Got it. And on the industrial and other end markets, do you see a similar trend into the back half? Or do
you see a stronger first half year or...

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

So my comment was for both automotive and industrial. We've talked about data center. It was strong.
It remains strong. We don't see anything that suggests it's different. There may be some communication
market changes that are driven by what happens with coronavirus. We don't know. But there is a large
5G cycle -- investment cycle that's starting. And then as far as defense and aerospace tends to be pretty
steady and how it goes. It remained steady with where it's at. And then the consumer cycle, we have yet
to see if we'll see some benefits. It needs further trade resolution for it to see any significant benefits, but
nothing new to report on that, on the consumer end of the market.

Operator

Our last question will come from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse Group.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I've been jumping around calls, so I apologize if this is a repeat. But Steve, if you kind of look at the
operating model for the business. Historically, you guys have always made good progress and then kind
of taking a step back as you've made acquisitions to then kind of move forward again. I'm just kind of
curious, if we go to an extended period where you're not sort of in the acquisition game. How should we
be thinking about operating margin targets and incremental gross and op margins for the business over
time?

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

So John, no, you are very correct that we make substantial progress in gross and operating margin after
an acquisition. And then when we do another acquisition, most times, we're not buying businesses that
are over 60% gross margin and 40% operating margins. So our overall company margin, gross and
operating, drop. And then we work back up few steps only to take a fall again when we buy the next
acquisition. Now if you make the assumption that for an extended period of time, we were to not do
another acquisition, then first thing that would happen is that we will reach our operating model. So our
operating model to remind everyone is 63% gross margin and 22.5% operating expenses, leading to a
40.5% operating profit. So 2 ends of it. First the gross margin. We're guiding 61.7% gross margin this
quarter. So it's 130 basis points away. If you just take the underutilization charge of $16 million, that
pretty much gets you there, almost.

The second issue is the operating expense. So operating expense, basically, we're guiding 25% to 26.2%.
And there is a huge leverage there with the revenue increase. The current revenue is -- I think, were
a couple of hundred million dollars behind that past record, very round number. So once you gain that,

17

MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 04, 2020

you have a significant leverage with the operating expense comes down. Some leverage still remains in
integration of Microsemi, with all these go-lives and all that, that are happening, which will take another
9 months. But once we get all that done, then you have achieved gross margin as well as the operating
expense and you have reached the model. Now if your question is, where does the model go? Do we
continue to go higher in gross margin and continue to grow higher in operating margin? For that, get in
line, and we'll talk about it when we get there.

John William Pitzer
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

That's helpful. And then just secondly, on Microsemi. With an acquisition, you kind of made as the industry
was going into a correction, and you're talking a little bit about kind of the expense leverage there. I'm
just kind of curious from a revenue leverage. I mean, one of the things you guys have always done well as
you bought these assets is going and kind of apply a better pricing discipline to the business. Is there still
more to go with the Microsemi acquisition? Or has that mostly played out?

Ganesh Moorthy
President & COO

First of all, I don't think we had the same pricing discipline issues in Microsemi as we did at Atmel.
Microsemi, just to remind you, was gross margins that were right around 60% when we did the
acquisition. The product lines at Microsemi are extremely sticky products, and many of them have very
long life cycles. And to that extent, those margins will stay high. The product line revenues will stay high.
Now we have -- in the time we have owned Microsemi started to work on, so how are we going to take
advantage of Microsemi's position in the end markets they were strong in, data center communications
and aerospace and defense, to be able to sell a more complete portfolio? And that work is well underway
and reverse how can we take Microsemi products into the end market that Microchip was strong in prior to
the acquisition, automotive, industrial and home appliances. And that work is going in. Now we have a 6-,
7-quarter window, where the environment has been weak. And as we emerge from a weak environment
and we go into a more normal environment, all the hard work that has been done will begin to play itself
out. And so I think there are revenue synergies yet to come. But in part, it's work to be done, and a lot of
that is underway and has been for some time. But a lot of it has to come as the environment strengthens.

Stephen Sanghi
CEO & Chairman

And John, I think if you study some of the past cycles, I know you and other analysts are very good
studying the past analysts -- the past cycles. What really happens is nobody believes the depth of the
downturn. And the estimates always stay high and they get cut multiple times. In this cycle, the estimates
fully have been cut 4x not only for Microchip, but for the industry and various other players, could be more
than 4x. And then when the reverse happens, the estimates always go higher. We can raise, we can raise,
we can raise for many quarters. I have seen this in prior cycles because nobody has the confidence to get
the revenue or guide the revenue to be higher than seasonal, and it continues for many quarters in the
other direction. That's what I'm hoping for, but not guiding to.

Operator

And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. So I would like to turn the call back over to
Mr. Steve Sanghi for any closing remarks.
