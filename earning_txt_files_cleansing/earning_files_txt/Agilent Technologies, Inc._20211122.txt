Presentation

Operator

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Agilent Technologies Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My
name is Bethany, and I will be the operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like
to introduce you to the host for today's call, Parmeet Ahuja, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir,
please go ahead.

Parmeet Ahuja
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Bethany, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's Fourth Quarter Conference Call for Fiscal Year
2021. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice
President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Mike and Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President
of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and
Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group.

This presentation is being webcast live. The news release, investor presentation and information to
supplement today's discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are made available on our
website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial
measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our
website.

Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year
and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of
currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on
exchange rates as of October 31.

We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no
obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of
our risks and other factors.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today.

The Agilent team delivered another excellent quarter to close out an outstanding record-setting 2021. At
$6.32 billion for fiscal 2021, revenues are almost $1 billion higher than last year. Full year core growth is
up 15% on top of growing 1% last year. The strength is broad-based with our 3 business units all growing
more than 10% core for the year. Our full year operating margins are up 200 basis points. Earnings per
share of $4.34 are up 32%.

Let's now take a closer look at our strong finish in 2021 and review Q4 results. Our momentum continues
as orders increased faster than revenue in Q4. And at the same time, we delivered our fourth straight
quarter of double-digit revenue growth. At $1.66 billion, revenues are up 12% on a reported basis.

Our core revenues grew 11%, exceeding our expectations. This is on top of 6% core growth last year. Our
Q4 operating margin is 26.5%. This is up 160 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.21, up 23% year-over-
year. Our earnings growth also exceeded our expectations.

We continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market, growing 21% driven by our
biopharma business. Total pharma now represents 36% of our overall revenue. This compares to 31% of
our revenue just 2 years ago.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

The strong growth in our chemical and energy business continues as we delivered 11% growth in the
quarter. This is on top of growing 3% in Q4 of last year. PMI numbers are positive, and we expect that
chemical and energy will continue its strong growth trajectory into fiscal 2022. In diagnostics and clinical,
revenues grew 11% on top of growing 1% last year as testing volumes started to recover.

On a geographic basis, our results led by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Our business in
the Americas grew 15% on top of 5% last year. China grew 8% core on top of strong 13% growth in Q4 of
last year. China order growth outpaced revenue growth for the third quarter in a row.

Now looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated
revenue of $747 million. LSAG is up 11% on both a reported and a core basis. LSAG's growth was broad-
based and led by strength in liquid chromatography and cell analysis. The pharma and chemical and
energy market were particularly strong for new instrument purchases. Our cell analysis business crossed
the $100 million revenue mark in the quarter for the first time.

During the quarter, the LSAG team announced a new Ion Mobility LC/Q-TOF and enhancements to our
VWorks automation software suite. These new, well-received offerings are used to improve the analysis of
proteins and peptides to speed development of new protein-based therapeutics.

The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $572 million. This is up a reported 10% and 9% core.
Growth is broad-based driven by strength in service contracts and on-demand services as well as for
chemistries and supplies. Our focus on increasing connect rates continues to pay off for us. The strong
expansion of our installed base in 2021 and increasing connect rates bodes well for continued strength in
our ACG business moving forward. Our ability to drive growth and leverage our scale produced operating
margins of roughly 30%, up more than 200 basis points from the prior year.

The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $341 million, up 16% reported and up 13%
core. Our NASD oligo business led the way with robust double-digit growth in the quarter and achieved full
year revenues exceeding $225 million. We expect another year of strong double-digit growth as the team
continues to do a great job of increasing throughput with the existing capacity.

The expansion of our Train B oligo manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado, is proceeding as planned.
We expect this additional capacity to come online by the end of calendar year 2022.

Moving on from our other business group updates. There are several other significant developments for
Agilent this quarter. We announced our commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by
2050. We believe our approach delivers the same rigorous sustainability that we applied to everything else
we do. We also believe these actions are not only the right thing to do, but fundamental to achieving long-
term success.

Our sustainable leadership continues to be prominently recognized as well. You may have seen that
Investors Business Daily recently named Agilent to its top 100 ESG Companies list. We're also a company
where diversity and inclusion represent a company priority and is a core element of our culture. During
the quarter, we achieved recognition by Forbes as one of the world's Best Employers and as the Best
Workplace for Women.

While the Agilent team has a strong track record of delivering above-market growth and leading customer
satisfaction, we're always looking to do more. To further accelerate growth and strengthen our focus on
customers, we are implementing a new One Agilent Commercial organization, combining for the first time
all customer-facing activities under one leader. The new organization brings together and strengthens our
sales, marketing, digital channel and services team. The new enterprise-level commercial organization
is led by Padraig McDonnell. Padraig will continue to lead the Agilent CrossLab Group as Business Group
President as well as serve as Agilent's first-ever Chief Commercial Officer. The way I'd like to characterize
this move to say we are doubling down on the success we've achieved with ACG, applying a holistic
customer-focused approach to all aspects of our business.

We're also moving the chemistries and supplies division to LSAG. This close organizational alignment
between instrument and chemistries development will further accelerate our progress on instrument
connect rates for chemistries and consumables. We believe that structure follows strategy and that this

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

new organizational structure will further enhance our customer focus and the execution of our growth
strategies.

Looking ahead to the coming year, we are in a strong position to continue to deliver on our build and buy
growth strategy. Agilent's business remains strong. We entered the new year with a robust backlog and
have multiple growth drivers, coupled with the proven execution excellence of the Agilent team. A year
ago, during our Agilent Investor Day, we raised our long-term annual growth outlook to the 5% to 7%
range, while reaffirming our commitment to annual operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS
growth. We are now 1 year in and well on our way to achieving these long-term goals. Bob will provide
more details.

But for fiscal 2022, our initial full year guide calls for core growth in the range of 5.5% to 7%. We expect
to continue our top line growth as we launch market-leading products and services, invest in fast-growing
businesses and deliver outstanding customer service.

My confidence in the unstoppable One Agilent team and our ability to execute and deliver remains firmly
intact. This is our formula for delivering solid financial results, outstanding shareholder returns and
continued strong growth. We are very pleased with our performance in 2021, but not satisfied. As I tell the
Agilent team, the best is yet to come for our customers, our team and our shareholders.

Thank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to
Bob. Bob?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone.

In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income
statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our initial outlook for the upcoming
year and for the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.

As Mike mentioned, we had very strong results in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.66 billion, reflecting
reported growth of 12%. And before I get into the details, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team,
which has been doing a great job managing in a very challenging global environment.

Core revenue growth at 11% was a point above our top end guidance range. Currency accounted for
0.8% of growth while M&A contributed 0.5 point of growth during Q4. And as expected, COVID-19-
related revenues were roughly flat sequentially and resulted in just over 1 point headwind to the quarterly
revenue growth. Late in the quarter, we did see transit times that were, in certain cases, greater than
anticipated, resulting in some revenues being deferred into Q1.

Our results were driven by a continuation of outstanding momentum in pharma and in biopharma in
particular, while chemical and energy and diagnostics and clinical also delivered strong results for us.
Our largest market, pharma, grew 21% during the quarter against a tough compare of 12% last year.
The small molecule segment delivered mid-teens growth, while large molecule grew 31%. Pharma was a
standout all year, growing 24% for the full year after growing 6% in 2020. And in FY '22, we expect our
pharma business to grow in the high single digits.

Chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 11% with instrument growth in the mid-
teens during the quarter. This impressive performance was against a 3% increase last year. The C&E
business grew 12% for the year, after declining 3% in 2020. Growth was driven by continued momentum
in chemicals and engineered materials, and we expect our C&E business to continue to grow solidly next
year in the high single digits.

Diagnostics and clinical grew 11%, with all 3 groups growing nicely during the quarter. While the largest
dollar contributor to this market is DGG driven by our pathology-related businesses, the LSAG business
continues to penetrate the clinical market and drive growth with strong performances by cell analysis and
mass spec.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

We saw mid-teens growth in the Americas and strong growth in China, albeit off a small base. For the
year, the diagnostics and clinical business grew 15% for the year after declining slightly by 1% in 2020,
and we expect to continue to grow in the mid- to high single digits in 2022.

Academia and government, which can be lumpy and represents less than 10% of our business, was up
1% in Q4 versus a flat growth last year. Most research labs continue to remain open globally and increase
capacity to pre-pandemic levels. China came in at low single digits, while the Americas and Europe were
roughly flat. For the year, we grew 7% after declining 4% last year. We expect this market will continue to
improve slightly in fiscal year 2022 and expect growth of low to mid-single digits.

Food was flat during the quarter against a very tough 16% compare. Europe and the Americas grew while
China declined. For the year, food grew 13% after growing 7% in 2020. Looking forward, we expect food
to return to historical growth rates in the low single digits.

And rounding out the markets, environmental and forensics declined 2% in the fourth quarter, off a 5%
decline last year as growth in environmental was overshadowed by a decline in forensics. For the year, we
grew 5% off a 2% decline in 2020. And looking forward, like food, we expect environmental and forensics
to grow in the low single digits in the coming year.

For Agilent overall, on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in Q4, led by Americas at 15%, China
grew 8% and Europe grew 4%. And for the year, Americas led the way with 21% growth, followed by
China at 13% and Europe at 12%.

Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. Fourth quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 90 basis points from
a year ago. Gross margin performance along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in an
operating margin for the fourth quarter of 26.5%, improving 160 basis points over last year. Putting it
all together, we delivered EPS of $1.21, up 23% versus last year. And during the quarter, we benefited
from some additional tax savings resulting in a quarterly tax rate of 13% and our full year tax rate was
14.25%.

Our share count was 305 million shares, as expected. And for the year, EPS came in at $4.34, an increase
of 32% from 2020. We continued our strong cash flow generation resulting in $441 million for the quarter,
an increase of 17% versus last year. For all of 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in operating cash
and invested $188 million in capital expenditures.

During the quarter, we returned $195 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and
repurchasing roughly 830,000 shares for $136 million. And for the year, we returned over $1 billion to
shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the year with $1.5 billion
in cash and $2.7 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.7x. All in all, a great end to an
outstanding year.

Now let's move on to the outlook for fiscal 2022. While we are still dealing with the pandemic and we
have the additional challenges around logistics and inflationary pressures, we enter the year with strong
backlog and momentum. For the full year, we're expecting revenue to range between $6.65 billion and
$6.73 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 6.5% and core growth of 5.5% to 7%, consistent
with our long-range goals. And this incorporates absorbing roughly 0.5 point headwind associated with
COVID-related revenues, with the majority of that impact coming in Q1.

We're expecting all 3 of our businesses to grow, led by DGG. We expect DGG to grow high single digits
with the continued contribution of NASD in cancer diagnostics. We expect ACG to grow in high single
digits with both services and our chemistries and supplies businesses growing comparably, while LSAG is
expected to grow in mid-single digits.

We expect operating margin expansion of 60 to 80 basis points for the year as we absorb the build-out
cost of Train B at our Frederick, Colorado NASD site. And in helping you build out your models, we're
planning for a tax rate of 14.25%, consistent with current tax policies and 305 million fully diluted shares
outstanding. All this translates to a fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS expected to be between $4.76 to $4.86 per
share, resulting in double-digit growth.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

And finally, we expect operating cash flow of an approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and capital
expenditures of $300 million. This capital investment represents an increase over 2021 as we continue our
focus on growth, bringing our NASD Train B expansion online, and expanding consumables manufacturing
capacity for our cell analysis and genomics businesses. We have also announced raising our dividend by
8%, continuing an important streak of dividend increases and providing another source of value to our
shareholders.

Now let's move on to our first quarter guidance. But before I get into the specifics, some additional
context. Lunar New Year is February 1 this year, a shift from last year when it was in mid-February. As
a result, we expect some Q1 revenue to shift to the second quarter this year as customers shut down
ahead of the holiday. In addition, as I mentioned, we do expect to see the largest impact of COVID-related
revenue headwinds in the first quarter. We estimate these 2 factors will impact our base business growth
by 2 to 3 points and a roughly equal in impact.

For Q1, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.64 billion to $1.66 billion, representing reported and
core growth of 5.9% to 7.2%. Adjusting for the timing of Lunar New Year and COVID-related headwinds,
core growth would be roughly 8% to 10% in the quarter. First quarter 2022 non-GAAP earnings are
expected to be in the range of $1.16 to $1.18.

And a couple of additional points before opening the call for questions. In conjunction with the new One
Agilent commercial organization Mike talked about, we will be reporting under the new structure starting
in Q1. In addition, we'll be providing a recast of certain LSAG and ACG historical financials to account for
the segment changes after the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K in December.

I am extremely proud of what the Agilent team achieved in 2021 and look forward to another strong
performance in 2022. With that, Parmeet, back to you for Q&A.

Parmeet Ahuja
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Bob. Bethany, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Congrats on a nice print here. Maybe I think my first one on -- Mike, maybe my first one on the guidance
here. A lot of questions around supply chain, inflationary environment. The guide of 5.5% to 7% core
growth for fiscal '22, what is it assuming for pricing versus volume? And does it assume any contribution
from inclisiran?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Vijay, this is Bob. I didn't get the last part of your question, maybe. Oh, inclisiran. Yes. So on the price
we do have built in roughly 1 point of price into our plan, which was slightly higher than what we had this
year, Vijay. And in terms of inclisiran, we won't get into individual customer products, but what I would say
is NASD is expecting another growth -- year of very strong growth.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

And just on that last point, Bob. Maybe Mike, for you. I think the Analyst Day outlook had an NASD
ramping up quite meaningfully. Has anything changed on NASD? Did this capacity ramp-up or timing
change at all? And I'm curious on inclisiran anything changed post the CRL response letter at Novartis?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Not at all. What I would say the one big change in the business is doing even better that we had
communicated in December of last year. So really appreciate the question. As you know, in my -- we've
been talking about the new capacity coming online, that's still going right for schedule. In fact, we just
reviewed it earlier last week and that's due to come online by the end of calendar 2022. But I think the
team has just done a fabulous job, which is we're going to be able to grow double-digit in '22 even without
that new capacity because they're able to continue to drive process improvements of broader book of
business and larger batches. So the business is really on fire. I mean we are very, very happy with it.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Vijay, if we looked at our order backlog, we're taking orders for 2023 already.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

I mentioned this to Bob the other day, Vijay, that a year ago, we were talking about could we fill up the
factory, could it ramp and we've blown right through that.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. That's fantastic, Mike. And just -- sorry, to clarify, post a complete response letter to Novartis, no
change in inclisiran assumptions for you guys, correct?

No, no.

Operator

The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.

The next question comes from the line -- excuse me, of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Mike, maybe just starting with the guide for next year. Can you just kind of talk through some of the
variables upside, downside that you consider when building the outlook. I'd be curious what you've
embedded for China specifically as well.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So why don't I talk about the -- what we see as the potential upside in the guide. And Bob, maybe
you can talk about our China assumptions. And by the way, we hope we came through or very happy with
the momentum we have in China. I think the upside sits with our 2 largest end markets, pharma and
chemical and energy. And as Bob indicated in his script, we are assuming high singles, I believe, Bob, for
the pharma market, really coming off this toward growth here in 2021.

If that high-level growth continues, that would represent upside in our biggest market. And we've got
a lot of really positive things happening in the pharma side, so I think pharma -- let's say C&E as well,
right, Bob? So we've always -- I think this is the most bullish language that I've had in the call for some
time about the C&E. So you can imagine there's been even some caution about not overplaying it too
much. But I'd say that our 2 largest end markets represent the highest where we think we may have some
upside relative to our initial first guide for the year. Bob, can you remind what we had assumed for China?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Brandon, it's a good question on China, and we continue to be very positive on China. If we look
at our backlog, our order growth rate has increased higher than our revenue for the last 3 quarters. We
exited 2021 with a record backlog going into 2022 for China. And our guidance comprehends high single-
digit growth in China. So both being led from a geographic basis, growth will be led by Americas and China
going forward.

Brandon Couillard
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then, Mike, in terms of the new organizational structure, why need the COO role now? And
then correct me if I'm wrong, are you planning to collapse ACG into the LSAG segment entirely because I
thought...

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes, no -- yes. So thanks for that clarifying question. So let me handle the second part of your question
first, which is the ACG Group will be 100% services in 2022. And then we're moving over the CSD ports
in the chemistry and supplies portion of that business over to Jacob for 2 reasons. One is just the breadth
of responsibilities that Padraig would have if we had made that change. But we think it's actually going to
be a driver of growth. And I'll ask Jacob to make a comment on that here in a second because we think
by having those teams even closer together, we're going to be able to even further accelerate our connect
rates on instruments with our chemistry products.

Why the change? Hey, it's best to make -- when things are going really well, it's really time to put down
the hammer and really go as hard as you can. And that's what we're doing here. So as you may know,
when I first came in as CEO, I had 5 sales forces. I collapse those into 2. This is the next evolution of

that overall transformation of the company with this One Agilent culture behind it. The real belief is that
the segmentation of our markets really costs are much more of a customer orientation as opposed to a
product-centric view of how we want to sell and reach our customers.

And when you think about the scale you get with the digital platforms, digital infrastructure, our services
organization, this makes sense to do this while you're on top of your game. So while things are going well,
we thought it was really trying to put the accelerator down even further. And Jacob, if you wouldn't mind
just to comment on to what you're thinking about your new responsibilities?

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

Yes. Thanks for that, Mike. And I'm totally excited, I think that with now that you see the consumables
business being part of ESG social instruments, we can truly build those end-to-end solutions. That will
really drive customer expectations. And I think Padraig and his team have over the past few years,
actually shown that the design in consumables that we can really drive a tremendous connect rate.
So I think they've already shown the path forward and now being completely into LSAG, we can really
accelerate that.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

And thanks for that, Jacob. And then maybe just to close off this line of response. Padraig, any thoughts
about your additional new responsibilities?

Padraig McDonnell
Senior Vice President

Thanks, Mike. First of all, really excited about the new role. And I think a unified commercial strategy and
organization will really continue to strengthen Agilent's customer focus and it helps us to align capabilities
for the future where we're going to kind of maximize the connect rate and customer lifetime value.
And also, I think, accelerate execution of our digital ambitions for -- to deliver near-term growth and
strategically invest for the future. So very excited and already building on what is a great capability in the

The next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Just making sure I'm there. So a couple of questions. I guess can you talk a little bit about the margin
expansion, 68 basis points is -- and just sort of keep that out. I mean you've got some inflationary
pressures, you've got some FX, you've got some COVID headwind coming off. Can you just sort of like
tease out what's the underlying margin expansion if just sort of normalize it? You also have obviously the
capacity coming on in Colorado. Just how should we think about the margins and just the different pieces?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Bob, do you want to take that?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Yes. Thanks, Derik. It's a great question. And what we've been able to do even in this last quarter
in the face of inflationary pressures, is be able to drive pretty significant margin expansion across our
businesses. And so as we think about that 60 to 80 basis points, just to put kind of perspective, we're
anticipating roughly 15 basis point headwind associated with that Train B buildup and that's hiring the

people and getting the product coming online and so forth. And so if we think about that, that's closer to
75 to close to that 100 basis points.

A lot of that's going to come through SG&A operating leverage and the activities associated with just not
growing our business expenses as fast as the top line. And we are going to be looking to cover some of
the inflationary pressures on the top line with that price that I talked about before, which we didn't really
have any significant price in 2021. We have started to see that. We took quick action earlier this year to
reflect that. And so a combination of it, most of it being in OpEx leverage, but there will be some small
operating leverage of the top line as well if you take out the -- excuse me, at the gross margin, if you take
out the NASD expenses as a result of covering our costs through pricing increases.

Derik De Bruin
BofA Securities, Research Division

And then just a couple of quick follow-ups. Any evidence of stocking about transportation, supply chains,
particularly on the consumable side? And just an update on Res Bio, looks like it's still lagging a bit versus
our initial expectations.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Derik, a follow-up on those 2 questions. So -- and I'll have Sam come in on the second question. So we've
not seen any real evidence of stocking on the consumables. So I think that's a pretty fair statement, right,
Bob?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

That's correct, Mike.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And then what you're going to hear from Sam in a minute, he'll provide a little bit more color. We
remain very, very bullish about the long-term prospects with Res Bio and a lot of the work is being done to
develop new opportunities with our pharma partners. But we're -- where are we on the short term as well.
Sam?

Samraat S. Raha
Senior VP and President of Diagnostics & Genomics Group

Thanks, Mike. In terms of Q4, whereas the revenue came in a little bit below expectations, and that's
driven in part by COVID-19-related delays in clinical trial enrollment, overall, the interest that we're seeing
both from our existing customers on the pharma side that we've been doing IHC work with as well as new
customers that's very, very real. In fact, we've now signed an agreement, which is our first with a large
existing customer giving evidence to the interest that's there.

In terms of the work that we're doing on the PMAs, these are approvals related to existing agreements
with our Resolution Bioscience business. We're making good progress on that. And so a lot of momentum
in a number of areas. So very pleased to have them as part of our business to really bring together the
strategy we've had, which is to be the companion diagnostic development and commercialization partner
leveraging multiple modalities, including immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing.

So my first question relates to the 2022 guide. What are some of the factors that might pull performance
back down to the mid-single-digit range, specifically something that would start with a 5 handle?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think what I would say is, first of all, I think our guidance is prudent given the beginning of the
year. If we saw continued greater-than-expected disruptions in the supply chain that may impact demand,
particularly in some of the applied markets that could do it, although we haven't seen that to be very
clear, Dan. We feel very good about where we are given our forecast and backlog. So we're -- I would say
our -- we have a bias towards the upside in our forecast as opposed to bias towards the downside.

Daniel Louis Leonard
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Appreciate that. And then a follow-up on the shift in chemicals and supplies from ACG to LSAG. If the logic
behind the move is to increase the connect rate, can you remind me where is the connect rate today and
where you want it to be over some period of time?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, it's a great question. And the team continues to do a great job under Padraig's leadership here to
do that both at the purchase and then on the ongoing aftermarket. What I would say is right now, if you
look at the overall attach rate, it's probably in the mid-20s right now. And if you look at the attach rates
year-on-year, we saw very nice growth on the new placements. So all the new instruments that Jacob
and team have been able to sell. That's why we feel very good about the ACG business going forward.
So we still have a long way to go there in terms of opportunity across both the services as well as the
consumables. Some of our competitors are higher than that. And so we've got aspirations that are well
above that mid-20s.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. And Dan, I'd just like to make sure it's clear. We're not making this change because we were
dissatisfied with the improvements in our connect rate. This icing on top of the cake to further accelerate
it as we look to balance span and control and business responsibilities with the -- the real driver was the
one commercial -- creation of the one commercial organization. And I think this is a nice secondary benefit
that we're actually going to get, we think, even more focused and tighter alignment between our product
development groups on the CSD side and instrument side.

The next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

So first one is on environmental. I mean you have a leading position there with a number of products
across the LSAG product line. Maybe just -- could you elaborate a bit more for us what's going on there,
specifically related to China, the timing in China. Is that just Lunar New Year? Or is there something more
that we need to consider?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think there's -- maybe I'll start, Bob, and you can jump in on this. So I think when we talk about
-- we talked about environmental and forensics. So I think it's sort of a tale of 2 cities. So buried in that
number is a decline in forensics. And I think that's probably really tied to governments prioritize other
investments in this COVID-19 world. The demand is just not there. I think relative to China, it's been

more about priorities. Right now, they're shifting some of their priorities towards the pharma and other
COVID-19-related-type investments. So I think that's probably...

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I mean, yes, the only thing I would add on that, Mike. There is some budget that we've seen that has
shifted into our fiscal first quarter and into FY '22, in particular, in China. I think long term, we still see the
importance of the environmental testing in China and around the world remains to be seen -- is still intact,
Puneet. And it's more a function of timing than anything.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Thanks for jumping in on that, Bob, because we still are very confident about our ability to grow our
environmental in China. I think it's well-known, the government's real emphasis on continuing to make
improvements in the quality of life of our citizens.

Puneet Souda
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just on the liquid chromatography just staying on that point. I really appreciate your
comments on the chemistry columns and consumables now being part of LSAG. But when we look at the
business overall today, you obviously have a strong 1200 series offering. We're also seeing pickup from
another leading competitor in the market space that has lost some share over the last few years and there
seems like they're gaining some back. But just wondering what you are seeing in the field and in terms of
further competition in this side of the market? I appreciate any thoughts.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I have -- Jacob, how I lead off on here. And first of all want to say is the key competitors in the LC
market remain unchanged. There's nobody new in the market. And what I can tell you is that we're very,
very happy with where we are in liquid chromatography. So we're not playing any kind of catch-up game
at all here. We delivered high teens growth in the quarter and exited the year with record backlog and
our growth rate in orders was significantly higher than our revenue growth rate. And I think, Jake, it's
fair to say that the strength is both on the large and small molecule size with the real standout of China
geographically. And I think you exited the year, but we see a record backlog. So we're really bullish on our
LC business and maybe you want to have some additional comments.

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

Yes. Thanks, Mike. It's something to be proud of. And I'm actually really good where we are right now.
As you said, we are growing very strongly. As I can see, when I look into the market, we're in a very
strong position versus our competition also. And just a reminder, we hear a -- a few quarters ago, we did
announce that we have expanded our Bio LC portfolio substantially. So we really have the full range of Bio
LC. Bio LC is out there, but we also have 2 DLCs and also online LCs to really drive growth in that area.
So Bio LC really came timely with all the investment that goes into large molecules right now. So I truly
believe we have momentum, and we'll continue with that over the next period of time.

The next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Bob, maybe one for you to start. Just on the margin side. I know you talked about 60 to 80 bps of
expansion. It sounds like the NASD facility might be a little bit of a headwind. Can you just talk through

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

14

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

the moving pieces there? I know you called out price a little bit as well. Can you just talk about the levers
and how much of an offset the facility is as we can kind of think about the underlying number as well?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So I would say maybe on NASD, if I look at it and I could break it into 2 components. If I look at it
with the existing capacity, that team not only has driven top line growth, but if we looked at the margin, it
actually is accretive to the overall Agilent margin. So that team has done a fabulous job ramping up...

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

It's accretive, right?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Accretive, yes. Very nicely. And so we're making the investment on Train B. It's roughly 15 basis
points. That's inclusive of that 60 to 80. So it's a roughly $10 million to $15 million of incremental costs
associated with the training and investments as the lines come on board. And so we're seeing that take
that to a side because those are kind of discrete. And if I look at the business, what we're seeing is the
faster-growing areas, we actually are seeing a benefit of mix. And so we talked a little bit about cell
analysis but also cell analysis in LSAG has been very accretive both on the gross margin as well as the
operating profit side.

And so we've got these faster-growing businesses that are helping with mix and then we're adding on the
incremental price to cover the inflationary pressures that we are seeing and so forth. But we've also got
productivity measures in place. And this is where I think the One Agilent approach to our systems and
our infrastructure really pays dividends because we're able to leverage those costs across a larger base.
And because a lot of that is internal we don't have that same level of pressure on cost as we are seeing in
some other areas. And so it's a combination of product mix, that price. I talked about 1% price and then
leverage in the operating expense side.

Patrick Bernard Donnelly
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then, Mike, maybe one for you on C&E. I know in the script, you kind of called out
maybe having the most positive tone you've had in a little while here on that segment. Obviously,
the end market health seems pretty high from the customers. Can you just talk about, I guess, the
conversations you're having there, visibility, again, guiding to high single for next year off a pretty strong
'21 is encouraging. So maybe just your confidence. And then again, it sounds like maybe there's even
some upside to that number.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Sure, Patrick. So yes, so we're seeing really good end market demand for -- and I think Bob
highlighted a lot of those like the advanced materials or chemicals. It really speaks to the overall recovery
economically on a global basis. And the fact that this -- in particular, this customer base had deferred a
lot of investments for some period of time. So they're in a reinvestment mode. And we have pretty good
visibility to the funnel. So I think we probably got at least a 6-month lead view on what's coming down on
instrument purchases. So we're feeling really good about the C&E business as well as there's an ACG story
here as well where we're continuing to increase services in this segment, which has historically been more
of a self-maintainer kind of market as well as the chemistries and consumables side.

So I think we've got pretty good visibility, given our confidence and be able to put this kind of number out
there in a full year guide at this point in time. Bob, anything else you'd add to that? I know we spent a lot
of time talking about this.

Joshua Paul Waldman

the pushout you referenced? And is this all LSAG?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Well, I'm going to pass it to Bob here in a second, but let me really clear in terms of our language. When I
use supply chain, that means material constraints and then we have logistics. I think the issues that Bob,
you -- the transit times was really logistics issue. In terms of our ability to get product to customers and
get the raw materials, we feel pretty good about what's been going on there. So.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, exactly. So it was more just longer delivery times. And Josh, it was in the LSAG business, as you
would expect. It was roughly 1 point in the quarter.

Joshua Paul Waldman
Cleveland Research Company

Okay. And given the transient nature, it sounds like you're assuming this all hits in the first quarter. Is that
kind of what's embedded in your guide?

Robert W. McMahon

We're assuming that it will get better over the course of the first half of next year -- or first half of the

Joshua Paul Waldman

Got it. Okay. And then I wanted to follow up on your comments within the LC/MS franchise. I believe in
your prepared remarks, you highlighted stronger install rates in this franchise in the fourth quarter. Just
wondered if you could provide any additional color on that, maybe what's driving it? Is it higher or faster
kind of accelerated refresh levels at legacy accounts? Or maybe you're seeing kind of increased win rates
at new accounts?

about what's going on in the LC/MS front.

small midsized accounts that are starting to build up their capabilities within the analytical instruments
business. So we see a lot of tremendous momentum there. But obviously, also the big accounts that is
more in the refresh mode.

only different customers, but at different spaces within customers. And it also helps with overall the
addressable market and in coverage. So the Agilent team and the Avantor team will be able to share leads

be able to find new customers and also increase the wallet here and customer side. So all around, a very

in the Q&A that you're taking in orders to '23. Could you just give us a sense like what the utilization is
today of your capacity that's available and any color about demand trends, book of business, things of that
nature?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. In short, we're running 24/7 at both our Frederick facility as well as our Boulder facility, which was a
legacy facility. And we are -- feel very good about our ability to continue to expand capacity. What Brian
and team have been able to do is increase both throughput as well as yield. And so that's really helped
us drive additional capacity with the existing footprint or the existing manufacturing facility. And the Train
B, as we talked about, has the opportunity to add more than $100 million of incremental volume coming
online starting at the end of this -- our fiscal -- our calendar 2022.

Daniel Gregory Brennan
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then maybe on the One Agilent, Mike, could you just give us -- I know, Mike, when you got
there, you made some changes to the sales force that have made under your predecessor, now you're
going further. So how should we see this manifest from the outside over the next, I don't know, 1 to
2 years? Does this lead to stronger growth? Is it going to lead to more better margins, more durable
growth? Just obviously, the customers are going to see something, but how will that manifest in reported
results, do you think?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

I think it's a check for each one of the things you listed there, but the #1 reason why we're doing is to
drive more growth. And it's just a natural evolution of the transformation of the sales force I started a
number of years ago. And it really points to the fact that we have this broad-based portfolio that's selling
into the same customer base. And why have 2 separate sales forces and have to go do the coordination
between across sales forces, and then the big push that we made over the last several years in terms of
digital, this allow us, I believe, to even go faster on realizing our digital ambitions.

And then you've got the voice of the customer will be right in the CEO staff. And on [ Padraig's staff ], the
Head of the service delivery organization. So everything relative to the customer facing that we do in this
company will be under one leader. We just think it's going to find ways to accelerate our growth, increase
our customer satisfaction. And I think as we push more and more of our business because customers want
to buy that way through digital, it will have a natural knock-on effect of efficiency gains in the P&L.

there, but just give us a sense of what the needs are today and what is the outlook for M&A in '22?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Sure, Dan. So I've used -- been using this order the last several years of the build and buy a growth
strategy. So we're still very interested on the buy element of fuel and future growth. And for example, in
this past year, we did the Res Bio acquisition really got us into liquid biopsy, it really allows us to play to
our strengths that we already have from our CDx and IHC business. So we're going to look for continued
opportunities such as those where you're in higher-growth markets than the total company average,
where they can really benefit by being part of Agilent and where they have differentiated technology and
differentiated teams.

We will stay in our lane, so to speak, on valuations. I'd say that the -- you know this better than I do,
perhaps, Dan. The market is still very robust. We're very active, and we just want to make sure that the
deal works for our shareholders. But deploying capital for M&A is part of our story going forward. And it's

Wanted to dig in a little bit more on cell analysis. So heard cleared $100 million in the quarter. What was
the 2021 contribution? And similar to the line of questioning on NASD, what's the target there for 2022
growth?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So I'll start with the cell analysis business, and I'll bring in Jacob here because it has just done a
fantastic job, and it's really continued the momentum that we saw at the beginning -- throughout '20.
So it ended just short of $400 million for the full year, and it grew in the mid-20s. And I would expect us
to -- looking forward if we think about where the market is headed and the fundamental demand there,
that will be growing double digits for sure going forward. And as I mentioned before, the beauty of that
business is it's right in grain with where the research and technologies are going and where a lot of money
is being put in, but it's also an extremely well-run and profitable business for us.

Michael R. McMullen

And Jacob, maybe you can give some insights in terms of where are the end markets you think that are
driving -- been driving the growth and where we think it's going to come from in the future?

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

Yes, thanks for that. It's a really good question. Obviously, it's something I'd really like to talk about the
cell analysis business has been super successful in the past years. And our focus on the immuno-oncology
space has really paid off. We continue to see opportunities there, and we continue to see that our portfolio
of being able to measure live cells is required to really drive the research forward. So where we really
see the opportunity is in the -- between biopharma and also the academic market there, that's where we
see the biggest and the biggest momentum going forward. While we have seen here in the past period of
time also that the diagnostic business, particularly with our flow cytometry is picking up good speed. But I
would say the main opportunity sits in the biopharma space.

My follow-up was going to be a lot of discussion, obviously, around driving growth. I was hoping to just
get your philosophy on CapEx. So I think the guidance implies about 4.5% of sales for 2022. That'd be
higher than you've done in the last few years. Do you expect this is going to remain elevated more kind of
in the medium term? Or is this just kind of some of the near-term opportunities coming through?

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Jack, that's a great question. And what I would say is if we look at where our -- there's different
kinds of CapEx, and it's not all created equal. But the reason that it's being increased is really to fund that
growth and capacity expansion, whether that be Train B and NASD or the capacity expansions in places
like genomics and cell analysis. And I would say, given our growth trajectory, in those areas. I would
expect us to continue at probably an elevated level to incorporate that growth.

As Mike said, we've got this buy and build strategy, and that's part of the build strategy. And it has paid
off in spades with NASD. And what I would say is we're not -- there's more letters in the alphabet than
B. It doesn't end at B. But what I would say is there's -- we're going to be prudent about it, but also be
aggressive about going forward.

First on the LSAG guide for mid-single digits. I think on the last call, you talked about the GC replacement
cycle coming back on, maybe being in the midst of an LC replacement cycle on small molecule, and you'll
now have chemistries in there as well. So should we think about this as being more towards the upper
end of that mid-single-digit range for '22? Or is there some sort of catch-up spend in '21 that maybe is a
headwind as we get into '22?

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

Yes, I think you're spot on it, Catherine. It's the former, not the latter. Think about it as a higher end. And
that's where I would say, if we think about where our opportunities for upside are in the instrumentation
business and continuing the strong momentum that we've seen. Now we're also going up against, I think,
a 15% core growth rate year-on-year. But we feel very good about the momentum in that business,
particularly in the areas that you just talked about in chemical and energy and in pharma.

We continue to believe that the pharma business coming out of COVID is structurally a higher growth
market. And as we continue to place our focus on the biopharma or the large molecule, if you look at that
throughout 2021, that was much -- growing much faster than the overall pharma business. And so we
would expect that -- we feel very good about that business going forward.

Catherine Walden Ramsey Schulte
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And then maybe one more. You've had a lot of success on NASD. Do you have any interest in
entering other areas of manufacturing components for biopharma, whether it's GMP reagents or DNA
plasmas or other areas? And is that something that you might get into in '22?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Well, Catherine, we're always looking for new drivers of growth that would make sense for Agilent to
be directly involved in. So nothing to report for 2022. We've got a handful of adding different additional
letters, if you will, to the alphabet that we serve in NASD, but never say never to the thesis of your
question.

Operator

And the last question is from the line of [ Noah Baron ] with JPMorgan.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Can you guys hear me?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Tycho.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It's Tycho. Sorry about the phone issues. A couple of cleanups here. So Dako, I appreciate the China color.
Obviously, people are focused on China tenders at the moment. It doesn't sound like you're flagging any
issues there, specifically for Dako, but can you talk about what you're kind of seeing on the ground there
for China? And then how big is the CDx business? You mentioned that earlier, Mike, and you obviously had
a bunch of press releases during the quarter about new approvals for CDX.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So Sam, I know this is something you've been talking to your team about relative -- specifically about
what maybe happened in the China diagnostics market and what's going on there. So we think we've got a
pretty good protective position. But why don't you elaborate a bit more?

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

Senior VP and President of Diagnostics & Genomics Group

Yes, happy to, Mike. Tycho, thanks for the question. We've had another, just overall for our pathology
business, the former Dako business, if you will, a really good quarter, including in China. And you may be
referring, Tycho, to the Buy China requirements that we're all aware of that are happening specifically to
our former Dako business, if you will. The relative unique position, particularly with PD-L1 and having a
minimal number of local competitors really differentiates us. So we haven't felt really pressure from the
Buy China impacting our business. But we have continued to see really good interest not only in PD-L1
companion diagnostics that brought more broadly speaking in China for our diagnostic products.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Sam, if I recall, you've got your PD-L1 registered in China, right?

Samraat S. Raha
Senior VP and President of Diagnostics & Genomics Group

Yes, we do. I mean when we registered that almost exactly 2 years ago, becoming the first-ever
companion diagnostic in China and it's doing well for us there in China. We've actually now trained over
400 different pathologists throughout China to utilize our companion diagnostic.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes.

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

And Tycho, maybe just a follow-up. If I looked at our business in China for DGG for the year, it grew in the
30s, and it was actually in excess of that for Q4. So it had very positive momentum and CDx is roughly
$100 million, ex the Res Bio acquisition.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. And then on cell analysis, Mike, I know one of the priorities you've talked about is moving that
portfolio downstream. Can you talk about those efforts, how actively you're looking at kind of pushing that
into QA/QC and further downstream?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Yes. So Jacob, why don't you follow up with some thoughts here.

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

So Tycho, when you said downstream, can you tell a little more?

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

More in the bioproduction side versus R&D, yes.

Jacob Thaysen
Senior VP and President of Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group

On the bioprocessing. So, yes, we see a big opportunity in the bioprocessing space, both for cell analysis
business, but also to our analytical instrument business. So I think that's something we will continue to
invest in going forward.

AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 22, 2021

Robert W. McMahon
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. I think what we're seeing right now, Tycho, is moving from truly research into the development area.
And then that will then lead into the QA/QC. So I think you see a multistep process here. And so as Jacob
said, it's just early days here from that standpoint. And -- but making great progress across all 3 of those
kind of sub-businesses and have high hopes for that to continue.

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

A similar flow that we've seen in pharma for years, right, which is start in our R&D then works its way into
QA/QC. And Tycho, I think you know we built this great business through a series of acquisitions and the
way we integrate into making it one business. And this would be an area of, obviously, future focus for us
on the M&A front as well.

Tycho W. Peterson
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Great. Just one last one on the new Agilent. I know you've had a number of questions on the kind of
rollouts there. Are there new services you're introducing in conjunction with that, are you broadening the
service portfolio?

Michael R. McMullen
CEO, President & Director

Not yet, but stay tuned. Sorry, this is a few weeks old.

Operator

There are no additional questions waiting at this time. I would like to pass the conference back to Parmeet
Ahuja for any closing remarks.

Parmeet Ahuja
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thanks, Bethany, and thanks, everyone. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a
great rest of your day.

Operator
That concludes the Agilent Technologies Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I hope you all enjoy the
rest of your day. You may now disconnect your lines.
