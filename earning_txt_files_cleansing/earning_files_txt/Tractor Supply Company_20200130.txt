Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. On the call today are Hal Lawton, our CEO; Greg Sandfort,

After our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for your questions. Seth Estep, our SVP of
Merchandising, will join us for the question-and-answer session.

Gregory A. Sandfort
Advisor & Director

Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone, who's joining us on the call today. Before we discuss
our fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a moment and update you on the CEO leadership change at
Tractor Supply that we announced in December. Hal Lawton officially joined the company in mid-January
as President and CEO. The Board engaged in a thorough and comprehensive search to identify the right
leader for this next chapter in the company's growth. I am very excited that the Board chose Hal as the
next CEO for our company. Hal brings tremendous experience across multiple retailers, including Home
Depot, eBay and Macy's. And more importantly, Hal is a great cultural fit, and I believe he is the right
leader for the future growth of Tractor Supply.

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

As we have previously communicated, I will continue to be available as an adviser to Hal and the company
through August and will serve out my Board term through May. My expectation is that this will be a very
smooth transition.

As this will be my last earnings call, I want to reiterate that it has been an honor and a privilege to serve
as the CEO of Tractor Supply. The Tractor Supply Company is a special company with a unique culture like
no other in retail. I believe the company is in great hands with Hal as CEO. The company has a strong
leadership team in place that is passionate about helping our customers live life out here.

While the Tractor Supply team has a tremendous -- has made tremendous progress in recent years, I
believe there is considerable opportunity ahead. And now I'll turn the call over to Hal for a few comments
before we address our quarterly results and outlook.

Harry A. Lawton
President, CEO & Director

Thanks so much, Greg. Good morning, everyone. It's great to be at Tractor Supply. For many years in my
retail career, I have watched and admired this company. Under Greg's leadership, the team has achieved
remarkable results, and I'm honored to follow in his footsteps.

As you are acutely aware, the retail industry is experiencing disruption and reinvention at an
unprecedented speed. Leading retailers need to excel at not only merchandising, customer service and
execution but also at data, technology, flexible supply chains and productivity. The key for successful
retailers, however, will continue to be the same, a differentiated customer experience.

With more than 2,000 stores complemented by our online sites, Tractor Supply has substantial scale, very
high brand loyalty with our customers, an incredible culture that is part of our secret sauce and a business
model that is supported by a strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation. At Tractor Supply,
we have a differentiated experience, a robust set of competencies and are well positioned to become an
even more integral part of our customers' lives.

I'm excited about the opportunity to continue to build on the ONETractor foundation the team has in place
to drive the business forward. We are committed to executing on our 2020 initiatives and delivering on our
plans for the coming year. The Tractor Supply team has been very welcoming me since the transition was
announced. In the coming weeks and months, I'll be out in our stores and distribution centers, listening
and learning as I spend time with our team members and customers. I look forward to engaging with you
in the future. And now I'll turn the call back over to Greg.

Gregory A. Sandfort
Advisor & Director

Thank you, Hal. And now let's move on to the results. Overall, 2019 was a solid year for Tractor Supply
with record sales and earnings. While the fourth quarter of 2019 did not meet our expectations on the top
line, the team did a great job of controlling those things we could manage. And as a result, we delivered
operating profit margin expansion for both the quarter and the year.

The most significant factor weighing on our sales results in the fourth quarter was unfavorable seasonal
weather trends. Across many of our markets, we were negatively impacted in the quarter with
unseasonably warm temperatures which hampered our ability to drive top line sales in numerous seasonal
categories. As I have shared with you consistently over time, the Tractor Supply customer is a needs-
based, demand-driven shopper, and there is relatively little that will influence the customer's purchasing
decision if that need doesn't exist.

Given the stronger traffic trends -- the softer traffic trends, we were unable to capitalize on impulse or
ancillary purchases. And as you have heard from other retailers, I believe the 6 fewer days between
Thanksgiving and Christmas over the prior year impacted our customers' gift-giving purchase activity to a
greater degree than we had anticipated. Over my 12 years with Tractor Supply, I have experienced these
seasonal impacts before, the fourth quarter of 2015 and again in the first quarter of 2017. And as always,
was the case, when temperatures arrived with seasonal change, the sales demand also returned.

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Despite the softness in our comp store sales, the underlying health of our business remains solid, as
evidenced by the continued strength of our core year-round farm and ranch categories, which generated
overall solid comp sales increases in line with our expectations and historical norms. The teams executed
well across store operations, merchandising, supply chain, planning and placement. The teams managed
inventories effectively and minimized our clearance exposure. We leveraged our retail price optimization
capabilities to preserve margins, and we had disciplined cost control throughout the quarter. I am very
proud of how this team reacted to and effectively managed our fourth quarter business.

Now let me touch on a few financial highlights for the quarter and the full year. For the year, net sales
increased 5.6% and comparable store sales increased 2.7% to reach a record $8.35 billion in sales. In
the fourth quarter, comparable store sales continued positive as we lapped a strong 5.7% increase in the
prior year quarter. For the fourth quarter, diluted EPS increased 9% to $1.21. And for the full year, diluted
EPS was $4.66 and adjusted diluted EPS was $4.68. We've returned $696 million to shareholders through
the combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends for the year. And this was the ninth
consecutive year that we increased our quarterly cash dividend for our shareholders.

In terms of operational highlights for 2019. We opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 8 Petsense
locations, increasing our store count to over 2,000 stores. We made solid progress on many of our
ONETractor strategic initiatives. We completed the rollout of stockyard in-store kiosk and mobile POS
technologies to all stores across the chain. We continued to experience a robust Neighbor's Club loyalty
program, with membership approaching nearly 15 million members as we exited the year and a retention
rate of approximately 80%. In addition, we also made great progress to improve our targeting of high-
value customers and look-alike customers throughout various digital channels.

We continued to invest in our dot-com business and sales once again grew strong double digits for the
quarter and year. Our private label credit card program was significantly enhanced with a new 5% back
reward to our Neighbor's Club members. And we completed the ramp-up of our new distribution center in
Frankfort, New York to support our continued store growth in the Northeast. We also achieved LEED Silver
Certification for this facility, making this the third LEED Silver Certification facility in our fleet. And Tractor
Supply was named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable U.S. Companies for the second year in a row.

So to summarize, 2019 was a solid year for Tractor Supply. And the team has a good handle on the
business and has built a robust plan for 2020. In over 80 years' time, Tractor Supply has grown from
a mail-order catalog business to the largest farm and ranch retailer in the country. And our passionate
commitment to our customers, team members, communities as well as our shareholders is the foundation
of our growth. All that has been accomplished over my 12-year tenure at Tractor Supply has been a total
team effort. I want to express my appreciation and gratitude to the nearly 34,000 team members across
Tractor Supply and Petsense for a job well done. And I'm excited to watch the progress and growth for
Tractor Supply that Hal and the team will provide in the coming years.

I will now turn the call over to Kurt, who will provide more details on our financial results for 2019 and our
outlook for 2020.

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Greg. Please accept my many thanks for your friendship and your leadership. On behalf of the
entire team, thank you for all you've done for Tractor Supply for the last 12 years.

Now let's get right into the results for the fourth quarter and the year. Sometimes weather-driven demand
can help sales growth, and then sometimes, it works against us. Every quarter can be a little different at
Tractor Supply.

What is at the core of our mission is that we are there for our customers with the right products they need
at the right time and the right price. To build on what Greg shared with you, our comparable store sales
performance was driven by continued strength in our core farm and ranch categories such as livestock
feed, fencing [ ]sensing, forage and animal health. Offsetting this strength was softness in categories such
as generators, rubber footwear, heating equipment, safes, insulated outerwear and toys.

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Within consumables, our pet food category average unit retail was impacted by the industry trend of
trade-down from grain-free products. Of significance, our data shows that we are retaining our customers
given the sales trends across the breadth of our product category offering. In the quarter, we continued
to drive comp increase of tonnage or pounds sold as total pounds of pet food. As well, our pet supplies
categories were up mid-single digits on a comparable store basis.

We would anticipate the trade downtrend to continue in the first half of 2020 until we cycle in the third
quarter. The unfavorable trends Greg mentioned, coupled with lapping of the hurricane benefit from
emergency response categories in the fourth quarter of 2018, impacted our big ticket performance. We
experienced softer results across generators, safes, stoves and air compressors.

Last year in the fourth quarter, we shared with you that we believed comp sales benefited by about
100 basis points from the weather. This year, we estimate the negative impact from warmer weather
represented about 2/3 of the comp miss versus our expectations.

Moving down the income statement. For the fourth quarter, gross margin increased 26 basis points to
33.8%. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in freight expense as a percentage of net sales,
from our cost reduction initiatives and the overall market, and to a lesser extent, the team's effective
management of our direct product margins as they work to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Including
depreciation and amortization, SG&A as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter increased 3 basis
points to 25.2%. The increase was primarily attributable to deleverage in-store personnel, occupancy and
other costs given the comparable store sales performance and incremental costs associated with the new
distribution facility in Frankfort, New York. Partially offsetting these SG&A increases were a decrease in
incentive compensation as well as disciplined cost management by the team.

Looking at our balance sheet. We believe our inventory is in good shape, and we are very comfortable
with its quality. As we enter the year, we're well positioned to wrap up the winter months and transition
into the coming spring season. In 2019, we generated cash from operations of $812 million, an increase
of about 17% over the prior year. Total capital expenditures were $217 million with approximately 35%
of this being maintenance-related and the remaining 65% being growth-oriented in areas such as new
stores, digital capability investments and supply chain infrastructure.

We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends
while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We're managing to a leverage ratio of
approximately 2x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR. The majority of our debt is a very low fixed rate, and we're
comfortable with our debt maturity ladder. For the fiscal year, we repurchased nearly 5.4 million shares of
our common stock. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2007, we've repurchased just
over $3 billion of our common stock. Our remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately
$1.5 billion as of year-end.

Turning now to 2020. We will continue to build on our strong foundation for long-term success across
the business. Our strategic initiatives are focused on allowing us to exceed our customers' ever-evolving
expectation and position us for further growth. The offering of relevant products and services for our rural
lifestyle customer is at the core of our merchandising plans. We will continue the introduction of industry-
leading and differentiated brands.

Coming into the spring season, the team is very energized about the launch of Toro, as this brand has a
strong reputation for quality that really resonates with our customers. The Toro brand provides us with the
opportunity to attract new customers and be more relevant with our existing customers.

We are also expanding our product assortment with a broader lineup of Cub Cadet and the addition of
Troy-Bilt. Combined, these brands will help solidify our position as a premier destination in the lawn and
garden category and enhance our already industry-leading lineup.

In equine feed, we have added the premium brand Triple Crown across the majority of our stores
to further round out our strong offering in this category. New space productivity technology for SKU
localization and assortment will be implemented across the chain to help drive specific growth plans by
category and refine our product mix. In addition, we'll be looking to enhance the shopping experience

through selective store within a store expansion with an emphasis on winning brands, such as Carhartt in
workwear, Purina in livestock feed and Husqvarna for outdoor power equipment. Overall, it is imperative
that we merchandise our stores with the products and brands at everyday low price our customers expect.

Exclusive brands continue to play an important role in our offerings. You can expect to see newness
through brand refreshes and line extensions across our exclusive brand portfolio. For example, Ridgecut,
our new exclusive workwear brand, will be expanded into footwear and accessories.

Our initiatives to drive loyalty through our Neighbor's Club program play an important role in connecting
with our customers on a more personal level. Our loyalty program is a transformational asset to Tractor
Supply that we will continue to elevate to drive greater relevance, engagement and loyalty. We're
actioning the rich customer data we are receiving from our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. The health
of our program continues to be very robust as measured by membership growth, increased penetration of
sales, greater frequency and higher average ticket sales by these customers. In addition, our core farm
and ranch customer, which is our largest group by sales, continues to be a strong -- to be strong across
growth, retention rates and spending.

Looking ahead, our artificial intelligence enabled tools allow us to scale our marketing efforts to target
communication on a one-on-one basis. Our Neighbor's Club communication is being customized to offer
products and services to an existing customer, engage a lapsed customer or welcome a new customer to
the program.

Our private label credit card continues to be a win for us. With the addition of a 5% reward that we rolled
out at the end of September 2019, cardholders are now able to earn $5 in Neighbor's Club rewards for
every $100 they spend on the card. The loyalty proposition is more competitive and easier for our team
members to communicate. We exited 2019 with an annual tender penetration rate approaching 5%, with
all metrics since the rollout of the reward positive. We've seen robust growth across applications, sales
and tender penetration.

In 2020, we anticipate capitalizing on the program enhancements to expand the Tractor Supply credit card
penetration, as we know that our credit card customers visit our stores more frequently and have a higher
average spend.

Across the organization, there is much work underway to support our strategic initiatives and to extend
our leadership position in our markets. What I've shared with you today are just some of the areas where
the team is focused to drive the business.

Let's now turn to our financial outlook for 2020. We expect net sales in the range of $8.75 billion to
$8.9 billion, an increase of approximately 5% to 6.5%. Comp store sales growth is anticipated to be in
the range of 1.5% to 3%. We anticipate opening about 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 to 15 new
Petsense locations. The cadence of new store openings this year should be more in line with our historical
trends as we anticipate more balanced openings in the first half of the year. Our expectation is for modest
gross margin improvement in 2020. We're forecasting slight pressure on SG&A due to ongoing wage
pressures and investments in our supply chain and digital space. Our outlook includes progress on our
profit improvement plans to help mitigate cost pressures and our ability to reinvest back in the business
over time. We are committed to ensuring our spending is directed to our highest strategic priorities all on
a sustainable basis.

For the year, we anticipate operating profit margin to be centered around 8.9%, with a clear emphasis on
maintaining our margin rate. Net income is forecast in the range of $575 million to $595 million or $4.90
to $5.10 per diluted share. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the
first half of the year and the second half as this is in line with how we manage the business.

As you model 2020, please keep in mind key factors to the cadence of our year. Our business performance
is expected to be stronger in the second half of the year as our compares ease. The first quarter of 2020
is forecasted to have the lowest comp performance of the year and correspondingly the most pressure
on operating profit. As such, we anticipate first quarter net income and diluted earnings per share to be
flat to the prior year's quarter. Significant factors driving this performance include: a discrete executive

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

transition cost of about $0.02 per share, the incremental cost from the Frankfort distribution center that
we do not lap until the latter portion of Q1, and cycling our toughest comps of the year. Although we are
seeing the unseasonably warm weather trends to continue into January, there is a significant amount of
the first quarter and the year ahead of us.

Moving to below the line. Our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.4% to 22.7% as
we do not expect discrete tax benefits that we received in 2019 to reoccur this year. Interest expense is
forecast to be approximately $22 million to $25 million. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase 4%
to 7%. This is below our recent run rate as we cycle the step-up in depreciation from the addition of our
new distribution center in the first quarter of 2019. As such, the growth rate will be towards the higher
end of the range first half of the year with the lower growth in the second half of the year.

For the year, our share repurchases are anticipated to range from $450 million to $550 million. For
modeling purposes, we've assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 117 million to 118
million shares in 2020. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $225 million to $275 million, with
roughly 2/3 of that spending going towards initiatives to support long-term growth. We remain committed
to a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in the business to support
long-term growth through the opening of new stores and our growth initiatives. We also are committed to
creating lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases.

That now concludes our prepared remarks.

Mary Winn Pilkington
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Public Relations

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Lasser with UBS.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And Greg, congratulations. And Hal, best of luck.

Harry A. Lawton
President, CEO & Director

Thank you.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

My question is on traffic. You're suggesting that the year will improve as it goes on. So when can we really
expect that traffic is going to get better?

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Michael, this is Kurt. The traffic trends for Tractor Supply, as Greg mentioned, the core of the business has
been very consistent throughout 2019. And really, the significant headwinds that we face in any particular
quarter are more about the compares as we saw in 2019.

And as we look at fourth quarter and transition into 2020, the traffic headwinds were more related to
the weather and seasonal trends. So looking ahead to 2020, I pointed out to you the toughest compares
in first quarter and even indicated what we've seen thus far in January from less-than-ideal weather
conditions. Outside of that, we anticipate to be able to drive comps in both traffic and ticket, and the
compares on traffic to ease more in the second half of the year.

Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And really my follow-up question is, putting the 1.5% to 3% comp guidance for this year in the context
of a 3% plus long-term comp guide target, the market's historically relied on maybe 1% to 2% growth in
traffic and 1% to 2% growth in ticket. Is that still a reasonable expectation over the long run? Because
some may argue that given how much -- how many initiatives have been in place, the traffic from the
quarter -- from the fourth quarter may signal that traffic growth moving forward might be a little slower.

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

For the long term, Michael, we would anticipate that we'll continue to have a balance of both, trying to be
more specific on either one of those in any particular year for the long term, not reasonable. But I would
say that our plans from the initiatives that we talked about expect us to be able to drive traffic and market
share, but we also see with the merchandising initiatives that ticket is going to play a key part in 2020 and
long-term as well.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.

Chandni Luthra
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

This is Chandni that's on behalf of Kate McShane. I guess we wanted to ask about understanding the
margin opportunity at both ends of your comp guidance. Is it safe to assume that there could be more
margin opportunity at the 3% range? And do you have to capture SG&A to keep margins flat at the low
end of your comp range?

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Sure. This is Kurt. The operating margin rate, as I mentioned, we're very focused on maintaining the
margin rate in 2020. Low end and top end of the range, there's a number of variables that can play into
the drivers of that. And we believe we've got the flexibility and strong plans in place that allow us at both
ends of those range. There is -- at the top and bottom end, there's sales mix that can play into that as
well as the team's ability to drive benefit from profit improvement. But even as we've shown in fourth
quarter, the team can flex down and managed expenses well. So we believe we got plans, and we'll be
very focused on either end of that range to maintain our operating margin for 2020 centered around at
8.9%.

Chandni Luthra
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division

And if I could quickly follow-up in terms of just the health of the consumer. Are you seeing any signs of
weakness from the energy economy?

Gregory A. Sandfort
Advisor & Director

I'll take that one. This is Greg. We've seen really no significant overhang from the chain in the oil markets.
And it's only about 10% of our mix anyway. And so I would tell you that, no, nothing significant. And yes,
we always look for indicators, trading down of different things like within feed and such. That's a pretty
good indicator of what may be happening with the consumers' overall confidence. We're not seeing any of
that. So for right now, I'd say steady as she goes.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.

Gustavo Arturo Gonzalez
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

This is actually Gustavo Gonzalez on for Scot today. I guess just in regards to pet food and obviously, the
recent trend away from natural grain-free products. Can you sort of provide us any more updates on what
you're kind of seeing in that segment? And if anything, kind of what you guys are able to do to sort of
combat that trend?

Jonathan Seth Estep
Senior Vice President of GMM

Yes, this is Seth. So similar to what Kurt stated on the call earlier, and we mentioned in the last quarter,
the grain-free trends due to the DCM announcement in early Q3 of last year has caused a little bit
of averaging our retail decline that we've been very open about. We have got a very robust category
management approach that we've been utilizing. And actually next week, over the course of the next 2
weeks in our stores, you'll see some significant reset activity as we continue to respond in those trends.

We'll have over 80 new items get launched in the stores. We'll also continue to be expanding upon the
brands that are benefiting from the recent trends. And we'll be launching new brands as well. So you'll see

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Gustavo Arturo Gonzalez
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Got it. And just one related follow-up. So it looks like our data kind of points to general pet food kind of
seeing a pickup in inflation in 2019 versus more of a deflationary trend over the past few years or so. Is
that kind of something that has manifested in the results -- your results recently across the pet business?
And kind of what would be your sense as to what is driving that recent pick-up?

Jonathan Seth Estep
Senior Vice President of GMM

Yes. I mean, when you look at the industry trends that are out there, when you see some of that
inflationary trend, I would say that's within the brands themselves. So if you look at some of the
introductions of the premium product in mass and grocery, obviously, they're seeing some price upticks as
it relates to their mix.

However, when you look across our portfolio, when you look at the back half of the year, we did see some
of the average unit retail decline just strictly due to the trade down and trade across from some of the
super premium grain products into some more of the traditional premium products. So at this point, we're
not seeing anything that's significant in terms of inflation.

Next, we'll go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Greg, congratulations, good luck. And Hal, my welcome. My first question is on 2020. So you guided
[indiscernible]. It feels like it's not a natural [ manner ] of the business given what you're seeing today as
opposed to Hal having a chance to look at the business and we make an assessment. And I just wanted
to confirm that and maybe hear from Hal regarding initial thoughts on the level of investment that the
business has been making over time and then the initial thoughts he had of the -- [ with looking ] kind of
into the business.

Mary Winn Pilkington
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Public Relations

Simeon, this is Mary Winn. We really are having a hard time hearing you on your line. So if you don't
mind, can we get you to repeat that question?

Simeon Ari Gutman

Yes. I'll pick up the headset. Is that better?

Mary Winn Pilkington

Next, we'll go to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And Greg, it's been a pleasure all these years and congratulations on a wonderful career. And Hal, it's
great to be working -- yes, it's really great to be working with you again. So I'm really excited about
everybody's future here.

I wanted to still put a questions to both of you. So yes, I mean sort of how do you think about the need
to invest here? You guys have put a lot of money into the business over the last few years, your stockyard
kiosk roll out, buy online, pick up in-store, loyalty card enhancements. So what do you think the big sort
of investment buckets that are left is sort of click-and-collect something that you think is right for your
customer in box size? Is there sort of like a big data, sort of data science need that you'd like to build out?
Just trying to get a sense of what big things are left to do versus what you've accomplished so far and
how maybe that could impact spending.

Gregory A. Sandfort
Advisor & Director

Chris, this is Greg. I'll start it out by saying that, you're right, we've made some investments. It's a terrific
foundation. But those investments are beginning to scale. I mean these things take time. And what --
we're happy with what we're seeing, whether it be a Neighbor's Club or be it in the use of stockyard,
the mobile POS initiatives, many of the things that we've put money into. I would tell you that this is a
wonderful jumping off point for me and a wonderful entry point for Hal. So from there, I think, Hal, I'll let
you take it.

Harry A. Lawton
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Greg. First off, I'd just say I'm incredibly excited to be at Tractor. It's a special retailer, as I said
in the opening remarks, with a real clear purpose. And I'd start with just saying, I'm excited about the
opportunity to continue to build on the foundation that the team already has in place to drive the business
forward. As Greg said, there's a number of really strong initiatives that are just starting to get scale.
We've incorporated those into our 2020 plan. I think it's a robust and realistic and prudent plan. The team
has a track record of success, and there is a strong management team in place.

I'd say, as it relates to me, I'm really spending my -- this is week 3 for me. I'm spending a lot of time
listening and learning right now with Greg, with the management team, spending time in our stores and
our distribution centers. And everything I'm seeing is only -- it's even better than what I had anticipated.
So I'm really pleased with the first 3 weeks in. And as I'd learn more in the team -- and things -- and our
views evolve, I look forward to sharing with the investor community over time.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Understood. So sort of a lot of money put in and figuring out where things are. So in a sense, a little bit
TBD.

Harry A. Lawton
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So -- go ahead.

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Harry A. Lawton
President, CEO & Director

So I was going to say, I think that's a fair assessment to me personally. I think as it relates to the
business, we're very executed -- very focused on executing our 2020 plan. As Greg said in his opening
remarks, we're very committed to a seamless transition here. It's a very purposeful overlap organized
by him and myself as well as the Board. And we have a strategy, a game plan in place for 2020. And as
it relates to any updates that we may make in our long-term strategy targets, we'll share more with you
that as it evolves. But we have a very clear 2020 plan.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned that 2/3 of the comp shortfall was weather, so call
that maybe 150 basis points. Do you think the rest was the 6 days? And does that suggest that you think
the underlying business is sort of that 2% to 2.5% that you had originally guided for? And related to that,
do you think that -- do you expect 1Q comps to be positive given the impact of the weather so far?

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Chris, this is Kurt. So there was a number of points in there. I'll just take the clarification on the
fourth quarter, what was the impact. We estimate based on the data that about 2/3 of the miss to
our expectation is weather-related. We have very specific weather-related items that we sell. And we
also know when the customer comes in for those seasonal weather trends need-based items. There's
additional items they purchase on their trip. 2/3 of our shift in the comp performance, we would package
as weather-related in those 2 categories. The remaining 1/3 is pretty well balanced between what we
mentioned on. We feel like there was an expect -- an impact from the 6 less shopping days. And we also
mentioned the AUR shift in the pet side of it. So those 2 really round out that remaining 1/3.

And the core of the business, as Greg mentioned, is strong. And the Q merchandise has consistently
performed solid comps in all 4 quarters of 2019. And as you know, we've talked about -- that's the core of
our business. That's what fundamentally we take into 2020. And we capitalize on seasonal weather trends
as the opportunity exists.

Christopher Michael Horvers
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And on 1Q?

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Chris, on 1Q, like I said, we anticipate first quarter to be our toughest compare. And January weather
conditions are not ideal at this point. But as it's the earliest part of our quarter, we still have a lot of the
quarter ahead of us. And as you know, Q1 is a transitional quarter, and you have us transitioning out of
winter and into spring. And the timing of that transition can really shift between Q1 and Q2. So still so
much about the quarter and the first half still ahead of us.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Congrats. Good luck to both Greg and Hal here. Hal, one for you, just to kind of pivot off of Chris'
question. I know it's only been 20 days or so. But I guess, just bigger picture, how are you thinking about
the foundation of the company in terms of store targets, the optionality with loyalty with what you've seen

at HD in Macy's. And, I guess, ultimately, do you think 9% is the right operating margin for the business
to succeed?

Harry A. Lawton
President, CEO & Director

To start with what I said earlier, is that I'm incredibly thrilled to be here at Tractor Supply, just a few
weeks in, doing a lot of listening and learning right now. I think probably the best way to answer that
would be just explain what attracted me to Tractor Supply. I'd start with, it is very much a differentiated
leading retailer in the space with a strong brand, a true reason for being in a differentiated customer base,
a very special culture and unique opportunities for growth. I'd also comment that the team has made a
number of investments in the last few years which are starting to scale, and you're seeing the benefits of
those with our customers, and we're confident that those will continue to deliver results in 2020.

I also do think that there is, as I said in my opening remarks, an opportunity to continue to become even
more integral into our customers' lives and things like the Neighbor's Club and other categories that we
are pushing on and activities are going to help us do that. But I'm very excited to be here. And as I said
earlier is, yes, I look forward to engaging with the investment community over time as appropriate.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay. So no initial thoughts on store targets or margins at this point?

Harry A. Lawton
President, CEO & Director

We have no updates to any of our long-term targets at this time. As we're still -- those are still very much
what we're focused on. And I think our 2020 guidance is consistent with those.

Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors

Okay, fair enough. And then just on 2020, when you think about what Tractor can control in terms of
sales. Can you force rank where you guys see the most optionality over the next 4 quarters in terms of
Neighbor's Club cultivating the relationships that you've built up, kiosks, digital. I know you got a couple
of new brands hitting Toro. Just help us contextualize how you think about the year in terms of what you
guys can control.

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Chuck, this is Kurt. I mentioned 3 things that we look at as the Tractor Supply controlled initiatives that
we believe benefit us in 2020, and we're going to lean on, and we've made the investments. First is the
relevant products and services. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our outdoor-powered equipment
lineup is strong going into the spring/summer season. So we'll lean on the combination of those brands
there as well as the introduction of Triple Crown.

In addition to that, secondly, our private label credit card momentum is strong, coming off the introduction
of the 5% reward back. And we'll carry that momentum out of the fourth quarter into 2020, and we
believe it's a sales-driving asset that we've got. And then I'd ranked third with that as Neighbor's Club
and how we're actioning the data, as we mentioned, to be able to not only retain and communicate with
potential lapse customers. But as a lifestyle retailer, the ability to find look-alike lifestylers and then
digitally engage with them is a completely new tool that we've got. We started to put that into place in the
back half of 2019.

And I guess, after those three, I'd throw in that we're excited about what John Ordus and the store
operations team is doing with their Tractor Way program that came out of operational efficiency. They've
taken work out of the back room and they're moving it to selling cultures. And where we've introduced
that earlier in 2019, availability of product scores from our customers were up and customer service

15

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

scores as well. And we know if those 2 increase, it's positive to sales. So we also believe, fundamentally,
there's some good traction in that program.

Operator

Next, we'll go to Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.

Steven Paul Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

I wanted to maybe revisit the fourth quarter traffic performance. Maybe if you could provide a little more
color around maybe the cadence of traffic where risks -- or if the weakness was concentrated during a
specific period in the quarter. It really is like if you compare December traffic trends versus the average, I
mean, is there a large call out or any sort of quantification you can provide us?

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, Steven, this is Kurt. In regards to the traffic trends, the -- first, the primary drivers mentioned was
weather-related. And I'd point that out because the 2 real factors on both comps and traffic were about
comparing up against a strong hurricane in October of 2018 and then the expected positive change in
weather conditions in December not actually occurring as expected and heavily forecasted.

So in regards to the cadence and expectation, October and November, as we expected, saw some decline
in traffic because hurricanes drive a good, heavy amount of traffic. You even get the ancillary customer
coming in for that destination. November was extremely cold last year. So October, November, while
traffic was down, was not against our expectation. The expectation was we would see more normalized
December cold weather, and that's really in both total and traffic where the missed expectation occurred is
principally in the month of December.

Steven Paul Forbes
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And just a quick follow-up, right, maybe stay with you Kurt, if you can just help us better understand the
monthly weights as we look out the fourth quarter -- the first quarter, what does January represent as a
percentage of the total as we conceptualize, right, the ongoing weather risk?

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Steven, we don't give specifics. But as we've said in the past, the quarter -- the months weight heavier as
you move through the quarter. So January is the weakest in total percentage of the three and March is the
heaviest.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And Greg, congratulations and good luck in retirement. And welcome, Hal. My question, the first one is on
2020, you talked a little bit historically about getting up leverage closer to 3% -- at the 3% level. You're
getting to flattish margins with a little bit less than that in 2020, at least the midpoint of the guide. You
mentioned, Kurt, I think, some efficiencies that you're getting. But are you underspending in any place?
Have you cut back in any spot?

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Simeon, this is Kurt. So in regards to long-term targets in 2020. Our long-term targets anticipate that
overall, in regards to our targets of continuing to invest in the business, opening 80 Tractor Supply stores,

16

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

we can have an assumed 3% plus comp and see operating margin improvement. What we also know is in
a year like 2020 where we anticipate that, that number could shift below that, we can make the necessary
investments in the business and we can actually -- we can flex and control, manage the expenses like we
did in Q4 to help us maintain that operating margin.

In a year like 2020, if we were to fall towards the bottom end of that range, the team will be as controlled
and nimble. And we've done that in Q4. And if that were to be the scenario, we would actually have lower-
than-normal levels of incentive compensation as an example. So we believe that we can maintain that
margin. And as we grow the business, we do think the long-term plans continue to show opportunity to
even have operating margin improvement.

Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. And then a quick follow-up is on the pet category. You mentioned you're looking at the data and
you're retaining your customers. Can you talk about -- are you still acquiring customers at the same rate?
I didn't know if you were careful with your comments because there is a change. I mean retaining is good,
but are you still growing your customer base at a rate that you were before in the pet and Q categories?

Jonathan Seth Estep
Senior Vice President of GMM

This is Seth. Look, when you look out at Q4 specifically, in Q3 and Q4, the ability for us to leverage our
Neighbor's Club capabilities has been really, really strong. So we're seeing nice gains when it relates to
acquiring new customers through utilization of that tool, specifically what Kurt was talking about, a little
bit in need with look-alike. So yes, we see us continuing to go out and acquire market share and gain new
customers through the category.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Seth Sigman with Crédit Suisse.

Seth Ian Sigman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Greg, best of luck. And Hal, welcome aboard. But wanted to follow-up on the comp outlook. I guess from
our side, we're still not clear as to why. It's largely just weather and you're not really seeing any sort
of change in the consumer. The comp guidance for this year of 1.5% to 3%, it is below that long-term
algorithm, that long-term 3% plus. And so is that just because of the first quarter comparison? Or are
we missing something? So if you could just add a little bit more context on why you're setting the range
where you are for '20 comps? And then I'll just have a related margin follow-up.

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Okay. Seth, this is Kurt. As we as we planned our 2020 year-end, the guidance that we shared with you,
we look at all factors, internal and external. Certainly, first quarter plays into some of that assumption. But
as we look at the business, we're realistic as to 2020. The -- while our customer continues to show signs
of being healthy, in 2020, with early signs, there's indications of GDP slowing. It's an election year. Those
types of things we had to consider in 2020 that can play into the consumer.

So we anticipate with our initiatives that we've got good momentum, fundamentals are strong, we can
drive in the long-term towards that target. But what we're presenting to you is a reasonable, prudent
expectation for comp sales in 2020.

Seth Ian Sigman
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Okay. And then so just in light of that comp outlook, why is flat the right margin setup for 2020? In other
words, if you do think that comps could be a little bit more constrained than the longer-term potential,

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

17

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

is there an opportunity to maybe invest a bit more aggressively this year? If you go back to past periods
where comps were under 3%, the margins haven't really been flat or up in those scenarios. So just love
to get your perspective on that. And then just the gross margin you are guiding to an improvement, any
more color on that?

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Sure. Seth, this is Kurt again. And as we framed up the operating margin for 2020 trying to center
around 8.9%, a number of the things that you mentioned is certainly a part of our consideration. As I
answered an earlier question, we believe we've got the initiatives in place that can allow us to, with profit
improvement and efficiencies, allow us to offset some of the pressures on the business, particularly wage
pressures to be able to maintain that margin. In other cases, we have initiatives in place that help offset
some of the investments we want to make in the business.

So the way I'd frame it up for you is we've got a number of variables and levers we're pulling, and
allowing us to make the right investments. If the comps were at the lower end, we may flex on it to allow
us to maintain around the 8.9% as well. So we're going to manage this real time, and we're going to work
with the levers and flexibility we have. And I'll just point back to Q4 again and just show our ability to
manage that and be nimble as an example.

Operator

And next, we'll go to Peter Benedict with Baird.

Peter Sloan Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Congrats, Greg. And welcome to Hal, I look forward to working with you. A lot of mine have been asked
here, I'm just going to hit a couple of quick ones. First, just maybe, I don't know if it's for Seth. But the
timing of the store within a store, Seth, rollouts? And also the SKU localization efforts, any color on how
it's going to cadence in 2020?

Jonathan Seth Estep
Senior Vice President of GMM

Yes. So first with stores within the store. I mean you'll start to see those to come to life as we do reset
throughout the year where we target key brands. So it's our goal not only to build on that strong exclusive
brands, but also make sure we anchor with the leading brands in the industry. And so as we do reset,
such as here in Q1, I mean, you'll see Toro come to life in the store as you're there. You'll continue to
see Purina come to life as we do our feedback resets. So those types of things will come throughout the
cadence of the full year and as we touch those planograms.

When you look at localization and store -- our localization, we just now are in the process of finalizing
standing up our assortment optimization platform. So we'll be rolling that out methodically, making
sure that, obviously, we do that as prudent as we can. While at the same time, when we think about
localization, the team has been really focused on partnering with some of our key suppliers as well. So you
take the spring season that we're rolling into here. We're going to make sure that we're set and ready to
go to capitalize. So partnerships we have with key suppliers, such as ScottsMiracle-Gro, leveraging their
analytics team, making sure that we have the right products and the right store at the right depth. That's
another key piece of the localization the team is focused on to make sure that we can capitalize on the
traffic and drive sales.

Peter Sloan Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe one for Kurt. So look, I know looking at the business in halves is
really the way to do it for Tractor Supply. But as we think about the 1.5% to 3% comp range for the
year, does that envision maybe any of the quarters being above or below that range? I mean it seems

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

18

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

reasonable maybe 1Q below that or maybe more opportunity in 4Q. Any color on just how you're thinking
about it, Kurt, would be helpful.

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Peter, I'd say, generally, there's low end and high end across the quarters. And as I mentioned, first
quarter is going to be our lowest. But nothing of significance to call out beyond that range of the 1.5% to
3% in any of the particular quarters.

Mary Winn Pilkington
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Public Relations

David, I think we've got time just for one more question in.

Operator

We'll go next -- go to Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo.

Zachary Robert Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I'll keep it quick. First question on the profit improvement plan. How much did that come into play over
the past 2 quarters, particularly with EBIT expansion on sub-3 comps? And then curious if you could
talk about what's next for the plan. And how do you think about the 2020 opportunity to drive further
productivity?

Kurt D. Barton
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Zack, this is Kurt. On profit improvement in the back half of the year, as you know, we've made
investments in store and DC productivity, indirect procurement and transportation. In the back half of the
year, the one area that really drove the key benefit coming out of it, that would be the transportation side
of it. We're able to jump on that early in late '18. And back half of the year, as you know, we saw benefit
from transportation. We're excited about the other categories, but there's been a balance of what we've
had to do to invest to make the changes in engineered labor standards in the distribution center. We had
to build an indirect procurement team and the work we've done to roll out all the tools and training in the
stores.

So the opportunity in those 3 other areas is now as we begin to roll that out and it matures and we
train. So these are multiyear benefits that just early in the maturity and a lot of runway in those 3 other
categories.

Zachary Robert Fadem
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then -- sorry, just in the pet and feed categories, just a quick question on your auto ship
efforts. Do you think this is an offering that resonates with your customer base? And then just given the
economics, is this an area we should expect to lean in on going forward?

Jonathan Seth Estep
Senior Vice President of GMM

So yes, this is Seth. So yes, we've obviously implemented some of the subscription-based services
throughout the year. We see it as an opportunity long-term that we'll continue -- to continue to test
into and make sure that we do it correctly. So you'll hear more about that in the future. But obviously,
the capability that we brought to life, we do anticipate leveraging as we move forward to make sure we
continue to drive market share.
