Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Jack Henry & Associates Third
Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As reminder, this conference is
being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, today, Kevin Williams, Chief Financial
Officer. Please go ahead, sir.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry & Associates Third Quarter
Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Williams, CFO and Treasurer. And on the call with me today is David
Foss, our President and CEO. In just a minute, I'll turn the call over to David to provide some of his
thoughts about the state of our business, the performance of the quarter as well as some comments
about our response related to the impacts of COVID-19. And then after that I will provide some additional
thoughts and comments regarding the press release we put out yesterday after market closed, and
provide comments regarding the guidance Q4 and full year, FY '20 provided in the release. And then, we
will open the lines up for questions and answers.

First, I need to remind you that this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks
or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or
results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to a number of factors that could cause
actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to a number of risks and
uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary
of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections
in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements.

On this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and
non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found
in yesterday's press release.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave.

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Those of you who listen to our earnings calls on a regular
basis may recall that I've started every earnings call I've ever done by thanking our employees for
their hard work and dedication to our customers and our company. At no time have I ever been more
passionate about that point than I am today. Since the onset of this pandemic, the Jack Henry team
has moved mountains to address the unprecedented needs of our customers, while at the same time,
demonstrating true commitment to each other and our communities.

To give you a sense of what that effort has included, here are just a few of the key initiatives completed
by our team since early March. Our crisis management team began conducting daily meetings at the
beginning of March to provide an ongoing review of information and plans for every aspect of our
business. They have been instrumental in our planning and success as the world around us has changed
so significantly.

Early in March, our human resources team enhanced our health care program to cover 100% of
COVID-19-related medical treatment for all employees.

We announced that we were offering full-time work-from-home status on March 16, and our corporate
technology services team successfully transitioned 96% of our employees by the end of that week. The

other 4% are required in a Jack Henry location every day to manage one of our data center operations.
Those employees began receiving bonuses immediately after we moved to a work-from-home status.

Our Lending Solutions team launched an online Paycheck protection program offering for our customers
within 3 business days of the CARES Act being passed in early April. We had customers processing loans
for their small businesses two days before the SBA was ready to start funding those loans. We also
expanded our lending network to provide support to our clients who were unable to book a loan for one
or more of their small business clients. To date, we have helped our clients process almost 70,000 loans
through the PPP program. And lastly, as you can probably imagine, call volumes in our call centers have
increased exponentially as our customers and their consumers moved out of their offices due to the
various stay-at-home orders. During that time, not only have the Jack Henry customer service teams has
risen to the occasion, but they did it while improving on our already industry-leading response times and
customer service ratings. Truly remarkable. These are just a few examples of the outstanding efforts put
forth by our team during this crisis.

In the past, many of you have commented on the unique culture at Jack Henry. The culture built on the,
"Do the right thing and do whatever it takes mantra." Never has that culture been on display in a more
meaningful way than what we've witnessed during the past couple of months. I could not be more proud
of our team and their ongoing commitment to our customers and our company and I thank every one of
them for weathering the storm with grace and passion.

Of course, we are not at the end of the road when it comes to dealing with the ongoing impacts of
COVID-19. We continue to operate primarily in a remote status, and our customers continue to get
comfortable with their new operating model. Although most of our clients are still unsure about the long-
term impacts on their businesses, we're seeing many get back to focusing on the day-to-day. A good
measure of this shift is the level of engagement we saw with our sales teams in April as things started
to settle a bit. Of particular note, we've already assigned 5 new core competitive takeaways in April as
well as a variety of other new contracts, and the combined sales organization exceeded their quota for the
month of April. We will be closely monitoring sales performance and sales pipelines as the fourth quarter
continues to progress.

With that, let's shift our focus to a look at our performance for the quarter we completed in March. For the
third quarter of fiscal 2020, total revenue increased 13% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP
basis. Deconversion fees were up almost $15 million over the prior year quarter with almost all of that
variance attributed to a single customer in New York. If you exclude the deconversion revenue variance
and focus on the non-GAAP number, you can see we posted a very strong overall revenue quarter.

Turning to the segments. We again had a solid quarter in the Core segment of our business. Revenue
increased by 12% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our Payments segment also
performed well, posting an 11% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP
basis. We also had an extremely strong quarter in our Complementary Solutions businesses, with a 16%
increase in revenue this quarter, an 11% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

Despite the obvious COVID-19 challenges for the sales team at the end of the quarter, all 3 of our sales
groups again hit or exceeded their quota, and for the year, they continue to run ahead of last year's record
pace. In the third fiscal quarter, we booked 14 competitive core takeaways and 11 deals to move existing
in-house customers to our private cloud environment.

Our Banno digital platform continues to see very strong demand, with 24 new clients signing for the full
digital suite in the quarter. We also signed 16 new clients to our new card processing solution.

Speaking of the new card processing platform, we have been providing regular updates on our progress
during these calls for the past several quarters. We are now 82% complete with the migrations, and we
ended March with almost 750 financial institutions on the new platform.

Prior to the onset of COVID-19, we were poised to wrap the migration for our core clients by June 30 and
had all 136 of those clients scheduled to convert in April, May and June. In early April, however, several
of the clients on those lists asked us to delay the schedule because they had minimized their employee

presence in their offices and didn't want to introduce any new payment solutions while their employees
and customers were working remote. As disappointed as we were to introduce a delay in a project that
has been moving along so well, we determined it was definitely the right thing to do. As a result, we
have delayed any migrations previously scheduled in our fiscal Q4 into Q1 of fiscal 2021. I anticipate the
migrations for our 86 noncore clients will also be delayed as a ripple effect so we now plan to see those
migrations happen in fiscal Q3 of 2021.

Regarding implementations for our other solutions, we are working closely with our customers who are
scheduled for on-site delivery of our solutions to ensure their needs are met while taking all necessary
safety precautions for our employees when they're required to be at a customer site. Delays of customer
system installations due to COVID-19 have been very limited, and we've developed processes to handle
remote installations when applicable. We expect these processes to provide flexibility and value, both
during and after the pandemic. We will continue to work as a partner with our customers regarding
implementation plans, customer service needs and support for their end consumers to ensure they get the
help they need during this difficult time.

Despite the uncertainty caused by the ongoing pandemic, let me remind you of a few of the fundamentals
about our company, fundamentals we emphasize regularly in our discussions with investors and analysts.
First, more than 85% of our revenue is recurring in nature. Second, we have very little debt on the
balance sheet, and we continue to operate with a solid cash position. Third, we've paid a dividend for 119
consecutive quarters, and we continue to be committed to our dividend policy moving forward. Fourth, we
have an extremely engaged workforce as evidenced by our employee engagement survey results and Best
Place to Work awards. And finally, remember that we weathered the financial crisis 12 years ago with very
few bumps or bruises. As we move forward, we will inevitably continue to implement minor changes to our
delivery and service models, but we don't anticipate the need to make any significant changes in the way
we serve our customers. We have a commitment to doing the right thing for our employees, customers
and shareholders that we believe will serve us well as we adjust to the new normal. We will continue with
our disciplined approach to running the company and expect that approach to help provide continued
stability for our company as we move to the other side of this pandemic at some point in the future.

With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some detail on the numbers.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Dave. The services and support line of revenue increased 15% compared to the prior year
quarter. Our outsourcing and cloud services continue to be a big driver in this line of revenue with an
18% compared to last year. As Dave mentioned, deconversion fees were up $14.7 million compared to
the year-ago quarter and all of those are included in this line of revenue. If you back out deconversion
fees and contribution from acquisition, this line of revenue on a non-GAAP basis grew by 8%. And the
processing line of revenue, which is all of our transaction, remittance and digital, grew 9% compared to
the prior year quarter. And again, there are no deconversion fees in that line of revenue.

Our total revenue was up 11% for the quarter compared to last year. And on a non-GAAP basis, revenue
was up 9% for the quarter, which is slightly ahead of our previous guidance. Our reported consolidated
operating margins increased slightly from 20% last year to 21.4%, which is primarily due to the increase
in deconversion fees. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating margins decreased slightly from 18.5% last
year to 18.1% this year, primarily due to the continued increase in additional costs related to our card
processing platform migration. With the delayed migrations that Dave mentioned, we will continue to
see these margin headwinds for the remainder of the fiscal year and into next fiscal year through Q3
of FY '21, until we can eliminate the additional costs related to the platform migration. With this shift
in timing and the impacts of COVID-19, at this point, it is hard to determine exactly when we will see
margin improvements next fiscal year, but we will definitely see margin improvements in our payments
segment in Q4 of FY '21 which will get the full year impact in FY '22. The impact of these cost reductions
at that point will remove headwinds and allow us to return to a position of leveraging our operating income
margins in FY '22.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Our Core and Complementary segment operating margins continued to improve, but the continued
pressure from our Payment segments we just discussed is offsetting that improvement. The effective tax
rate for the quarter decreased to 19.7% compared to 22.4% last year, which -- this is primarily due to
the difference in the uncertain tax positions, which were reserved annually under FIN 48 according to IRS
and with the lapsing of statute of limitations between the 2 periods, respective reserves are released.
This quarter was impacted a little more heavily due to the additional and above normal releases related to
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminating the Section 199 deduction, so there were no new reserves to offset
those Section 199 that were released.

Net income was $73.9 million for the third quarter compared to $59.3 million last year with earnings per
share of $0.96 this year compared to $0.77 last year. The $0.96 for the quarter included positive impacts
from deconversion fees and taxes which were offset by the negative impact from the loss on disposal
of assets. Considering these adjustments, our earnings per share related to operations came in slightly
ahead of the consensus estimate for the quarter of $0.80. For cash flow, our total amortization increased
5% year-to-date compared to last year due to capitalized projects being placed into service. And included
in the total amortization is amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, which decreased to $15.4
million year-to-date this fiscal year compared to $15.6 million last year.

Our depreciation is up year-to-date, primarily due to the timing of data center CapEx that we talked about
a year ago being placed into service last fiscal year and getting a full 9 months of depreciation this year.
Our operating cash flow was $276.4 million for the year-to-date, which was up from $233.4 million a year
ago. We invested $126.8 million back to our company through CapEx and developing products, which is up
2% from $123.9 million a year ago.

Couple of comments on our balance sheet. We currently have a cash position of $109.5 million. We'll be
sending out annual maintenance billings at the beginning of June. In February this year, we renewed our
revolver with a 5-year term and increased the maximum borrowings to $700 million. There was a $55
million draw on our revolver at the end of the quarter at March 31. However, we do anticipate paying that
off by June 30 and be net cash. We have no other long-term debt on our balance sheet other than leases.

We are closely monitoring and modeling all lines of revenue and watching relative key performance
indicators. We're focused in monitoring cost controls, especially in significant areas of costs like headcount,
travel, meetings and discretionary spend. In our guidance, we're anticipating a slow rebound in debit card
usage as parts of the company reopen -- or parts of the country reopen, I'm sorry.

At this point, it appears that income from deconversion fees will be down approximately $1 million
compared to last year's Q4, which just to remind you, we have no control over the timing of recognizing
deconversion fees that we receive. As reported in the press release, our GAAP guidance for revenue for
Q4 is a range of $408 million to $415 million with EPS of $0.77 to $0.79 per share. Our full year revenue
guidance was increased to a revenue range of $1.695 billion to $1.702 billion with a full year earnings
per share of $3.83 to $3.85. We will continue to experience revenue and operating income fluctuations
between our fiscal quarters due to various things, such as license revenue, implementation timing, our
ongoing payment platform migrations, and also software subscription usage, which, obviously, you'll see
in Q1 of next year. We anticipate GAAP operating margins for Q4 to be down a little from last year's fourth
quarter so for the full fiscal year, it should be mostly in line with FY '19 at approximately 22.5% operating
margins. Our effective tax rate for FY '20 should end up at approximately 23% for the full fiscal year.

As we have historically done, we will be providing revenue and earnings guidance for FY '21 during our
Q4 and year-end earnings call that we will have in August. We are currently in the process of developing
our budget for FY '21 and evaluating the overall impact to be anticipated and expected from COVID-19.
At the same time, developing our FY '21 budget, we will be focused primarily on targets and forecasts,
specifically for Q1 of FY '21 to assist with the guidance we will provide in August.

However, let me remind you as I know you will be working on your models before we provide official
guidance, as Dave mentioned, our recurring revenue year-to-date is over 85%. And if you remove the
onetime deconversion fees from total revenue, our recurring revenue is actually a little over 88% of our
total revenue. So be sure and use those as you're building your models for FY '21 before we give official
guidance at our year-end earnings call.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.

Daniel Rock Perlin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And I hope everyone is healthy and safe. I wanted to start off just at a high level in terms of -- as you've
had conversations or both of you have had conversations with your bank partners, I'm wondering what
type of insight they're providing back to you in terms of the health of that channel. Like right now, it feels
like things are relatively stable, but it does also feel like things are likely to get worse there. And so I'm
just wondering where -- what kind of anecdotal evidence you're hearing from those partners?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Dan, it's Dave. So good question. Obviously, probably not a surprise to you that we've been talking to a
lot of our customers here in the past several weeks. Talked to a few CEOs just in the past 3, 4 days. And I
think the consistent feedback from them is -- so first off, this crisis that we're in right now was caused by
a health crisis, not by a financial crisis. Obviously, it's created ramifications throughout the U.S. economy.
But the banks and credit unions that we work with and the CEOs that I'm talking to have emphasized over
and over again that the health of their institutions was really very solid before this came on. So they're
well capitalized, their credit quality is high, plenty of liquidity. And so they're feeling generally pretty
strong about the opportunity in the future going forward. They -- for those who chose to participate in the
PPP program, they were being paid by the SBA to process those loans. So there is an income stream for
them there, and that's helping for some institutions. Some have been very successful in the PPP program.
And so they feel strongly about the fact that they're not only helping small business and helping save
Main Street by being administrators of that program and working with small businesses to help them
out, but there is the benefit that there's some revenue coming into the financial institution that helps --
that participates in PPP. So generally, although everybody is concerned about what the future looks like
here and when do things "return to normal," generally, they're pretty upbeat that they can weather the
storm. And yes, they'll have to deal with some businesses that may be troubled, and they may have some
mortgage payments that they're going to have to accept the idea of delaying a mortgage payment and
so on. But they're generally pretty positive about the future. And I think it's because they recognize that
although this is turning into a financial crisis, it wasn't caused by banks like the one that we went through
12, 13 years ago.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. And to Dave's earlier point, I mean, we came out of that one in 2009, 2010, pretty much unscathed.
And that was a financial crisis. So I mean, obviously, there's going to be some issues with the financial
industry coming out of this. But obviously, the good thing, as Dave said, most financial institutes winning
this race very well capitalized with strong balance sheets, and they seem to be still in a pretty good place.

Daniel Rock Perlin
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's great. And just as a quick follow-up in terms of trying to understand the implementation cycle
impact. I mean I think you gave some good color there. But it does seem like there's going to be some
air pockets that get created. And so what I'm -- what I'm actually interested in is, can you just help us
understand how you would do kind of a digital knowledge transfer if you couldn't be physically on-prem for
some of these if this was much more protracted than, say, the one quarter that you're kind of alluding to
pushing to a kind of, I think, the first quarter of next year?

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

President, CEO & Director

Sure, sure, yes. And it's been fun and exciting and kind of remarkable, frankly, to see the implementation
teams shift gears into a new mode of delivery. So a lot of the solutions that we deliver were already
delivered virtually. And we do training online. We do training. We weren't using a whole lot of video to do
training before. We are now as people become much more comfortable with the video technology, but we
did a lot of implementations remote previously. Now many of our teams have adapted the way they do
implementations, adapted the way they do training. They're taking advantage of virtual tools like video to
do training. So it really hasn't interrupted, as I mentioned in my opening comments, it hasn't interrupted
our implementation pipeline much at all. In fact, I think it was 2 weekends ago, we did 3 core conversions
on that same weekend. It was either 2 or 3 weekends ago. And we're installing -- Banno Digital suite,
has always been installed virtually -- not always, but for year or so has been installed as a virtual install.
So the teams have adapted and we're delivering things differently. There are some customers who aren't
100% comfortable all the time. They want somebody there to hold their hand. And so we kind of work
through that. But most of our solutions now, we're in a position to implement virtually.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

And Dan, for some invitations, I mean, we still are sending people onsite, which is one of the nice things
about having our own corporate planes. So we can safely take our employees to the facilities and work
for the banks through a safe distancing relationship. And also, we have always done a lot of classroom
training virtually, which we are doing that. We've got several classrooms set up with multiple monitors to
do training. So that was already in place. So the nice thing about this is we were already -- 27% of our
employees were working remote anyway and probably another 25% or 30% work remote during -- at
some point during the week. So this was a pretty easy adaptation for us to get to where we are today.

Operator

Your next question is from the line of Vasu Govil with KBW.

Vasundhara Govil
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Good to talk to you and glad everyone is doing well. I guess just the first question on the revenue
deceleration in the fourth quarter. I mean even excluding the deconversion fees, it feels like there would
be a slight slowdown. Could you talk about what's driving the impact by segment? Is it mostly the
payment segment where you were expecting to see the weakness? If you could give us some color there?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I mean the primary drive we're seeing and what we're projecting in Q4 is we did see a slowdown
in our debit card usage in the last half of March. Even though we still had strong Payments growth for
the quarter. And so we continue to see that slower debit usage in April. And like I said in my opening
comments, we are assuming and predicting that we will see some rebound in June as the country opens
back up. That is -- that's the primary drag on the revenue growth in Q4.

Vasundhara Govil
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And I guess, I know you will get guidance for 2021 next quarter, but if you could
give us some high level color, like do you think the fourth quarter will be the trough in terms of growth
rates? Or could there be a lag effect depending on what you see on sales? And if you could perhaps
compare and contrast how the impacts this time might be different from what you saw in the great
financial crisis. Back then, I guess, revenue sort of went from double-digit to flat and then recovered back
pretty quickly. Like what kind of sort of a recovery curve might you see this time?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

So I think it's a little different now to look at our financials compared to what you saw back in the financial
crisis. And the difference is ASC 606. Because remember, we're now under different rev rec rules than
we were back then. So when we were able to start delivering software little quicker back then, which
obviously we don't deliver a whole lot of software now, so you're not going to see a sudden rebound.
However, we've been under ASC 606 for 2 years now or we will be by the end of this fiscal year. So now
you kind of see the fluctuations created in our financials the last couple of years, which Q1 is typically a
high quarter now because of all the software usage and subscription revenue that has to be recognized at
the beginning of the year, which that grows every year as we continue to sell those throughout the year.
And then it kind of tapers off throughout the year from Q1 to Q4, which is kind of opposite from the way it
used to be. So I think, as I said in my opening comments, with recurring revenue being 88% of our total
revenue, we still have a solid backlog. Through Q1, our sales bookings were still up 12% over last year.
As Dave pointed out in his opening comments, we actually exceeded quota for April. So do we anticipate
some headwinds on sales? Yes. But having said all that, I feel really good going into FY '21 at this point.

Vasundhara Govil
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division

That's very helpful.

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

I think a key point to remember there is that when we sign a new Core customer, we don't see any of that
revenue for months after that customer is signed. And then once we do start to see revenue, it's layered
in as opposed to getting a pop in that revenue. So -- and that's Core. Now many of our other solutions are
maybe a little shorter implementation time line. But it is rare for us to sell. We're not a sell-and-bill kind of
company normally. We're going to sell and put it in the backlog and it gets rolled out and the revenue gets
layered in. So that's part of the predictability of the model.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.

David Mark Togut
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Kevin and Dave, hope you're both staying well. Just bridging to the earlier question, could you talk about
potential inflection points in the business as a result of COVID-19? For example, you've had very strong
demand for a while for Banno Digital suite. But do you expect to see an accelerating shift toward digital
banking as more consumers, perhaps, don't want to walk into bank branches?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a good question, Dave. And definitely, I think you're on the right track there. So the things that
we're seeing right now -- it was interesting as the whole COVID-19 thing was coming into play here, so I
think back to the beginning of March and into mid-March, there was a lot of speculation that people would
immediately try to upgrade their digital presence. Well, in fact, the reaction was kind of the opposite.
I don't want to mess with anything right now. My customers are all -- my consumers are all changing
their behavior. I just want to leave things alone right now. But now that, that's settled in, we have a lot
of customers realizing that the -- that for them to be successful going forward, they do have to seriously
look at upgrading their digital presence. And that's not just what we used to call mobile banking. It's the
entire digital banking suite, including opening accounts online and so on. So we definitely are seeing a
shift in interest, a shift in conversation about that as people are thinking about the future and trying to
make sure they're positioned well for the future. And I think there will be more things. Commercial --
online commercial lending. We've talked many times in these calls about the outstanding technology we
developed for commercial lending online. We had signed a number of banks and some credit unions for
that technology, but many of them still viewed commercial lending as opposed to consumer retail lending.
Commercial lending, they viewed us that function where somebody has to come into the branch. You

can't possibly do a commercial loan without looking that person in the eye. Well, now today, guess what?
They're doing a lot of commercial lending over the -- digitally. And so we have a number of customers
looking at upgrading that piece of technology as well. So I think you're absolutely spot on. As we look
toward the future, digital will be much more of a topic than it has been.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. And the other thing I'd throw out there, David, and obviously, it's too early to tell, but as Dave
pointed out in his opening comments, we signed 11 additional existing core customers to move from
end to out. I think COVID-19 is going to continue, if not accelerate that trend somewhat. And I think our
hosted network services offering will probably grow even faster than it was because I think some of these
FIs are realizing that they really don't want to have to mess with any of the technology and they'd rather
us do it. Again, it's -- that's a prediction on my part. It's too early to tell, but I have to believe that, that is
going to be part of this whole conversation in FY '21 going forward.

David Mark Togut
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just a follow-up question on capital allocation priorities. Kevin, you highlighted the strength of the balance
sheet. How are you thinking in this environment about capital deployment when you look at your share
price? Obviously, dividends have been a priority for many years and then potential acquisitions to the
extent seller expectations have come down versus, let's say, 6 months ago?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes. So David, I mean, obviously, we're in a very good capital position. As Dave pointed out, we've paid
dividends for 119 straight quarters. I don't see us breaking that string. We have a Board meeting next
week. So at that point, we'll probably be announcing another dividend. And of course, that's up to the
Board, not to me. So dividend is a priority. But you're absolutely right. We continue to talk to bankers
about potential M&A activity out there. And we think that there will be some better opportunities later
in this calendar year and into next calendar year. In fact, I've got e-mails from 3 different bankers this
morning, wanting to set up calls to talk about potential deals and different things. So obviously, #1
priority is to continue to look at those acquisitions that give our shareholders a continued strong return.
We will continue to increase dividends. And we'll continue to look at buying stock back. I think under the
circumstances right now, I don't know that, that would be viewed extremely well for us to buy back stock.
But obviously, if there was a dip in our stock price, we would probably jump in with both feet.

Your next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.

Kartik Mehta
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

Kevin, just to get your perspective. I know in August, you'll provide a lot more about FY '21, but Dave and
you talked a little bit about credit card -- the card migration and impact on margins. As you look at FY '21
early on, would you expect non-GAAP operating margins to be flat in FY '21? Or are there headwinds that
could prevent that?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

So -- and again, we're just working on our budget in quarters at this point, Kartik, but so margins, non-
GAAP margins in Q1 should be slightly better because of all the software usage and software subscription
revenue that gets recognized with very little cost in the first quarter, which should be enough to offset the
increased cost for the Payments migration. After we do the migrations in Q1, we should get some relief.
I'm not sure exactly right now what that relief will be off the Payments migration as we're able to start
shedding some things down. So Q2, you might see as basically flat. I think Q3 will continue to go down

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

12

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

a little bit because of the continued pressure from the migration. And then we should see a nice pop in
margins in Q4. So again, we're still in early budget stages. So what I'm hoping for, Kartik, is that margins
for next fiscal year are at least equal to this year. But again, it's really too early for me to even make that
prediction.

Kartik Mehta
Northcoast Research Partners, LLC

No, that's helpful, Kevin. And then, Dave, you talked a little bit about one of the things that COVID-19
is bringing is maybe more in-house customers looking at going to outsource. What kind of revenue
contribution or growth contribution has that had in the past? And it seems like that could help accelerate
revenue. So I'm just trying to understand maybe how much of a benefit that's been in the past and what
you think it could do as we go in the future?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Thanks, Kartik. Essentially, when you go from in-house to outsourcing, the revenue to Jack Henry
has doubled because we're taking on all the processing responsibility for that customer. I think you could
probably figure out that our costs aren't doubled because we rolled them into an existing infrastructure.
So revenue essentially doubles and usually, when we sign a customer go from in-house to our host -- or
private cloud environment, usually, they also take on other products at the same time. So there's this add-
on effect of them adding products. Those decisions are easier for them in that environment because there
isn't a capital outlay. Usually that decision to add a product doesn't need to go to the Board for approval.
They can just add it into their monthly fees. So they're usually pretty comfortable talking about adding
things that they wanted to add for a long time. So that move has definitely been a key driver for us in the
past and will continue to be for quite some time. Even if we speed up the rate of migrations here, we have
many, many quarters of customer activity in that area before that runs out. So lots of runway yet.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Yes, because right now, Kartik, we're at -- 61% of our core customers are currently in our private cloud.
So almost 40% of our close to 1,900 core customers are still in-house that has the opportunity to move
over. And as far as revenue contribution, in any given quarter or year, I mean, if you go back to the last 8
or 10 years, I mean, we've averaged about 45 to 50 a year, but the revenue contribution in any given year
can be so significantly different, based on the size of the institutions that we move in any given quarter or
year.

Your next question comes from John Davis with Raymond James.

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Glad to hear you're doing well. Kevin, I just want to talk on the Payments business for a second. If you
assume Jan and Feb were probably a double-digit growth. I think March probably exited down low to mid-
single digits. Yes we've seen an improvement in April and then kind of what's embedded? Do you have
positive Payments growth embedded kind of in the guide for 4Q? Any color there would be helpful.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

So for the entire quarter, is it going to be some growth? Yes, JD, but it's going to be back-end loaded in
the quarter because April, we continue to see some headwinds from lack of usage as people were staying
at home. I think as now we're seeing countries start to open up again, so it's pretty early to tell. But I
think we're going to see some increase in May and then hopefully a decent rebound in June. But it's not
going to be much growth over last year's number.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

And I think 1 important thing to keep in mind here is -- so that's focused on our Debit business, our Card
Processing business. But there are 3 aspects of our Payments business, and they include bill pay and our
EPS, ACH Origination and Remote Deposit Capture business. Both EPS and iPay, our bill pay business,
both are performing well. They did not see a big -- they saw a dip for 1 week, that week in March where
nobody knew what was going to happen tomorrow. But absent that 1 week, volumes continue to be up
year-over-year. Those are a part of the key payments infrastructure. Not a lot of discretion in a lot of that
stuff. So those continue to be up year-over-year even though there's this impact on the debit switch. I
think that's important to keep in mind that, that helps offset some of the potential challenge in the Debit
business.

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then on complementary, obviously, really strong growth in the quarter, significantly better than
I had thought. Anything to call out? And how should we think about sustainability of that growth, which I
think heads over into the double digits in the third quarter?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So part of it is digital. So digital is in that bucket. And certainly, a big chunk of that was our continued
implementation of digital solutions, our treasury management solution, some of the things that we've
talked about here recently, online commercial lending. So a number of those things are in that bucket,
and we had a strong quarter in all those areas. Will it be as strong next quarter? I don't know that I can
say that, but it certainly is an area of growth for us, and it's a particularly strong area of focus for our
customers. So I think you can assume that, that segment will continue to perform well.

John Kimbrough Davis
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Last one for me. I think April to date, I think you cited 4 competitive takeaways, which is not too
far off the run rate that you've been kind of averaging. But any commentary on what new RFPs look like?
Because assuming that those competitive takeaways you want in April, those were kind of well underway.
Have we started to see RFPs go back out or are banks kind of just hunkering down for the meantime?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Actually, I quoted 5 for the month of April. And of course, the first-time ever -- first time I've ever quoted
on an earnings call, what's happening in the current quarter that we're talking about. But I thought it
was important for you all to know that sales has really continued to perform well. But to your question,
RFPs, we've had some RFPs come in. I think it's logical for you to assume and for anybody to think that
the RFP volume has slowed down a little bit. But I will tell you that our pipeline has not dropped at all. So
what that means is as you're booking deals, as deals are getting signed going out the funnel, there are
new opportunities coming in the funnel so that we ended April with essentially the same size pipeline that
we started April with, even though the sales team exceeded their quota for the month of April. So I think
that's a good sign that there are still activity out there. And as I mentioned, we have a lot of bankers now
that are starting to think more in terms of returning to focusing on the day-to-day. I won't say they're
thinking about returning to normal because they still don't know what normal is. But they're focused on
the day-to-day, and they're thinking about things like digital and about -- Kevin mentioned our HNS, our
Hosted Network Solutions service, things that will help them with efficiency, things that will help them with
expense control. There is a lot of talk about bankers now focusing on moving to a single source provider,
which is great news for Jack Henry because we have such a broad suite of solutions. And so we believe
that may help us pick up some business where customers maybe were using a small third-party for 1
piece of their -- 1 piece or 10 pieces of their solution set. Maybe they'll bring 1 or 2 or 3 of those to us as
they're focused more on minimizing risk and working with a single source provider. So I think there are a

lot of things happening right now that bode well for Jack Henry. But we need a little more time under our
belt here to really say, with confidence, that the sales process isn't going to be negatively impacted.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

The other thing I'd point out, JD is obviously back in 2009, which was obviously different times and
different circumstances but it was still kind of a hailstorm that the financial institutions are going through
today. And I would tell you, in 2009, our core system evaluations actually increased from what they were
before the financial crisis started. We did have a lag in some of our complemented products, but I don't
think we can see that this time because of the increased demand for digital and some of the other things
that Dave mentioned like commercial lending. So I think we continue to be in a very good position to face
these challenges going forward.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with Davidson.

Peter James Heckmann
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

How are you going to handle user conferences, trade shows? And how much do those typically contribute
to sales of ancillary products?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Yes, it's a good question. We actually -- I'm dressed up today for the first time in 6 weeks. I've actually
got a sport coat on because as soon as we end this call, I'm going to go and record a virtual presentation
for our first client conference since the pandemic struck. So what we've done, we normally host a
client conference in April and one in May. And the one in May, of course, normally leads up to the
analyst conference that we tend to visit with all of you at. Both of them have been turned into a virtual
conference. And so we have -- and these are smaller conferences as opposed to our large conferences
at the end of the year. So I think I saw this morning, we have somewhere over 400 attendees currently
that are registered for this conference. So we'll be doing that virtually, continuing to share information
with them virtually. We have the next -- our normal -- our big annual conferences would be in September
and October. We're still talking about what we're going to do with those conferences. So will people
be comfortable gathering in a large group for an industry conference in September and October? As
I sit here right now, I don't know. So that's a big topic for us. And as you point out, those are good
opportunities for us on the sales side to share information about product and so on. So we're doing a lot
of remote demonstrations today. The sales organizations pretty quickly move toward focusing on remote
demonstrations back in March. And so if we aren't able to host the large client conferences at the end
of the year, I'm confident that we'll be doing virtual conferences and included in those conferences will
be opportunities for us to demonstrate solutions. The good news in all of that is, when you do a remote
conference, you tend to get a lot more people who sign up because there's no travel expense. And so it
may expose us to more eyeballs than we would in person, but we're not at that point yet where we're
ready to make that decision.

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Pete, the education conferences, we have the big ones for credit unions and then for the JAC for bank
and ProfitStars. I mean those are truly education conferences. Is there some sales opportunities coming
out of those? Yes, and I notice there are quite few leads, typically. Yes. But those are truly education
conferences. And if we do have to go virtual, we will still do large education portions of that for people who
want to sign up because that's what we want to do to make sure that our customers continue to learn how
to better use our products and make their institutions more efficient.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Got it. Got it. Okay. And then one other question I had just on real-time payments and the release
you had out earlier in the week. Can you talk about some of the use cases for real-time payments and
what the fees might look like that the bank might charge to the payer? And then lastly, what will those
payments conditions [ shared ] from?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

Yes. It's a good question. I think that opportunity is still developing, not only for us, but certainly for our
customers. I think a lot of our customers aren't exactly sure yet what the 2 depths of the opportunity is
for them. But all of us, I think our customers and Jack Henry, we view the real-time payments opportunity
very differently from the Zelle opportunity. So Zelle real-time P2P, but as we've stressed many times on
these calls, there is not really much of a money-making opportunity when it comes to Zelle. It's hard
to make money on free, right? So Zelle has not been a focus as far as the money-making opportunity.
For real-time payments, there definitely is a money-making opportunity there because not only will it be
used for consumer payments, but we see it being used for commercial payments. So our expectation is
that it will definitely impact check volume because keep in mind, today, most of the paper check volume
that's out there is in business payments. So I think it will play a role when it comes to check volume. I
think it will play a role in displacing ACH transactions that are happening out there today. So that is an
opportunity as far as we're concerned. And then card, maybe, but I think it's much more likely to replace
ACH and current paper check as true real-time payments start to roll out.

Operator

Your next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. And I guess, first of all, just a follow-up kind of on Kartik's question. When you talked about margins,
was that all kind of ex-term fees? When you said you expected up somewhat in fiscal '21, was that ex-
term fees and including term fees? I would imagine it might be down a little just given you had the big
term fee this quarter?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

That would be true. Yes.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And I guess one other one just on margins. Is -- we can see the margins coming down a little bit,
obviously, with the implementation and all that. Is the Core margin, like if I take [ the non ] term fees,
take out all implementation stuff, is -- are the Core margins still going higher and what's driving that, just
core revenue growth?

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

So you kind of cut out there, Dave. So to recap. I think what you said, what's driving the Core revenue
growth and offsetting the negative in Payments? Is that right?

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. I was just trying to understand to make sure that the core margins are still going up when you
exclude all the one-off stuff.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

Kevin D. Williams
CFO & Treasurer

Oh, yes. I mean you can just -- you can look at the just the segments. And yes, both GAAP and non-GAAP
went up for the quarter on margins for Payments and complementary. And obviously, the big driver of that
is the continued growth and [ into out ]. Like I've said in my opening comments, I mean, our hosted in
cloud services was up 18% this quarter over a year ago and up still double digits. I think on a non-GAAP
basis, we're still up like 12% or 13% for the year. So that's been the same for the last 3 or 4 years. I don't
see that changing going forward or even into next year. Complementary continues to be driven by a lot of
our private cloud products like digital and other things, but a lot of other products that are added into our
private cloud Core customers. So both of those segments grew nicely and essentially offset the decrease
in margins in the Payment segment.

David John Koning
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then finally, is there any big difference between like what your
Core clients are doing in an environment like this relative to your like ProfitStars clients? Like, is there at
all a divergence in kind of how you see the activity over the next couple of quarters: one growing a lot
faster than the other? Or is it just all pretty good still?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

No. I'd say it's all -- there's no difference between Core and ProfitStars as far as sales success for what
we're seeing. So I emphasized the Core deals that we've done in April just because I knew that would be
on your all's minds, wondering whether that big revenue driver has totally stopped. But no. ProfitStars
performed really well in April and has continued at about the same pace.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

Glad that everybody at Jack Henry is doing okay. First one is both of you mentioned, I think, the relative
optimism of banks, I think, probably relatively better than me and many on this call would have assumed.
Is there something unique about the group that you hear more optimism from? Are their balance sheets
different? Are they different sized? Are they different focused banks: more commercial, less commercial?
Or is it fairly broad based?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

I'd say it's fairly broad-based. I would -- I tend to talk to CEOs of banks and credit unions that are on the
larger side of our base. So we'll say our largest customers today run up in the $30 billion space. And it's
rare for me to talk to the CEO of a financial institution that's $250 million. It's much more common for
me to talk to somebody who's in the $1 billion range. And I think the consistent theme there is, what I
emphasized earlier, that they feel strongly that the balance sheet is strong, that they're well capitalized.
They haven't taken on risky loans. Yes, they have deals they're going to have to work through with their
customers, but the PPP program, many of them have gotten into that in a big way. And the PPP program
includes a forgiveness component, which we'll be working on with a lot of these -- of our customers going
forward. And they tend to know their customers. And so they know that -- what their situation is and their
ability to work through these things over time. Now they can't predict the future any better than you or I,
but I think they're generally fairly optimistic that they'll be able to weather the storm and be okay because
they know about the strength of their balance sheet and the strength of their overall portfolio.

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

And the other thing, remember, Brett, [ I was saying ], yes, I mean, net interest margins absolutely went
away. But I mean, they're essentially back to where they were 3 years ago. And they weathered that
storm by figuring out a way to get noninterest fee income and different things. So I mean, it's basically
pull out the playbook that they were using 3 years ago.

Brett Richard Huff
Stephens Inc., Research Division

That's helpful. And then just in terms of digital usage. You talk about a pause in evaluation of digital
products. I think, Dave, you said maybe for a week or 2. And then the conversations resume, which is a
good sign. But we've gotten a lot of questions on actual usage. So I guess, sort of same-store users what
a typical bank, XYZ that might have had 5,000 Banno or NetTeller, whatever the product is they're using,
goDough. Did that go up meaningfully as folks got more fearful of going into a branch? I mean do you just
see absolute number of users spike?

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

The number of users went up for sure. I can't -- I don't have those numbers in front of me, but the
number of users went up -- active users went up significantly. The thing that was really startling to
me was -- so we entered this period of pandemic and everybody staying home. And so the number of
registered users, active users, volume went up. There was -- over the first couple of weeks there, there
was about a 40% increase in volume of transactions. The thing that caught me off guard -- thankfully, our
team was ready for it -- when the stimulus checks started to come out. So that Monday in April, whatever
that Monday was, on that single day, we saw a 63% spike in usage and people hitting their account as
compared to the prior week. And that week had been up, as I mentioned earlier, over weeks prior to that.
So what people were doing was they've gone and see, "Is my stimulus check there yet?" No. And then
5 minutes later, "Is my stimulus there?" No. "Is my stimulus check there?" No. Every 5 minutes, they
were hitting their account. So volumes just went through the roof. So it wasn't that all of a sudden, there
were a whole bunch of new active users, it was people just over and over checking to see if they had their
stimulus check deposited. That's all settled down now. But the real -- the true run rate per day is up, like I
say, roughly 40% over what we saw before all of this started.

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.

Timothy Wayne Willi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just 1 question I had. Regarding, I guess, digital and spending by the banks, there's -- I guess there's
always been a long debate about are the bigger banks winning because they have these large budgets for
their own discretionary investments and strategies. The counterargument has always been that people like
yourself are able to arm, the mid- to small-sized banks to be just as effective as those large ones. And I
guess, given, again, sort of the acceleration in the technology curve that's happened over the last couple
of years, could you just sort of address your thoughts about where sort of your core customer base is,
competitively, and then to the extent that you're actually sort of keeping an eye on fundamentally because
a lot of them are private entities as opposed to public. Is there actually quantifiable evidence when you
look at their deposit growth, their loan growth that shows that, yes, absolutely, by working with people
like yourself or your competitors, these mid- to small size institutions are actually very competitive and
performing versus the big monolithic entities that get a lot of airtime on CNBC, et cetera, about their
technology investments? And then I had a quick follow-up.

David B. Foss
President, CEO & Director

You packed a lot into that question, Tim. So let me talk for about 1.5 hour here to answer your question,
but I'll try and do it concise -- in a concise manner. So first off, you're right. The major players are
spending a lot when it comes to technology and spend a lot on digital. I would challenge your statement

JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  MAY 05, 2020

about us trying to position our banks to offer the same service as those banks. That is not what we're
doing. We have been very, I think, thoughtful in the way that we've designed our digital solutions to
offer a competitive edge to our customers as compared to those solutions in the functionality. The
functionality is just different. And I won't go through all the puts and takes here, but I feel very strongly
that we've created a better solution because we know that for our customers, for our banks and credit
unions to differentiate against those players in a digital world when that whole aspect of walking into the
branch and facing a smiling face across the teller line is not there anymore. The technology has to help
you differentiate. And we've done that with our solutions. So we believe strongly that we've delivered
something that truly is a differentiator.

Our customers, I don't know that we have customers who can say to you, "Well, on the loan growth
side, we can point to the digital presence." I believe that's there, but I don't think people are tracking it
as much as on the deposit growth side. And we have a number of customers who absolutely can point
to the digital platform as providing new opportunities for them to grab customer growth and overall
deposit growth through that channel. So there is anecdotal evidence, and you'll see more and more press
releases and marketing releases from us on those types of topics as we continue to see more. One of
our customers who is kind of a power user of the Banno suite, recently did a podcast with the ABA and
emphasized how significant the opportunity has been for them. It's a large -- about a $25 billion bank
-- I think, $20 billion bank. They did a podcast with the ABA, and this was a key part of their discussion
was how this solution has differentiated them in this world of digital. So like I say, I could talk all day, but
that's kind of the short answer to your question, as short as I can make it.

Timothy Wayne Willi
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

And my quick follow-up was just on M&A, but more from a perspective of your customers. So you've
also, over time, sort of showed that the sweet spot of your customer base probably are more likely to be
acquirers at the low end or sort of MOE situations where your customers tend to get larger. Periodically,
you'll lose one that gets sold. I'm just sort of curious when you -- are your bankers, were they in the
mode of 10 years into a recovery prior to COVID in a mode of looking to do M&A as they rebuilt their
balance sheets and move forward. But then again, just sort of assuming that, that mentality will come
back as we sort of come through this period of time. Did you feel as if your customers were out on out
looking for deals in M&A to build their own franchises? Had that changed at all?

So you're right, many of them were active in M&A. In fact, a little while ago, I referenced the fact that
we did 3 Core conversions on 1 weekend. One of those was a brand-new Core to Jack Henry that was
converted at that day. But 2 of them were existing customers converting acquired institutions into
their bank. And so our customers were definitely on the M&A track, acquiring other institutions prior to
COVID-19. I'll be honest with you. I haven't heard anybody, one way or the other, say, whether they
thought this was going to provide an opportunity for them or if they were going to -- this was really going
to put them off the idea of doing more M&A, have not had those conversations. Everything I've been
talking to people about has been the future as far as their balance sheet and their interaction with their
customers and that kind of thing. But I would expect that once recovery starts to happen, those bankers
will be out looking for acquisitions, just like we are today actively looking for acquisitions. They'll be
looking to see if there are opportunities.
