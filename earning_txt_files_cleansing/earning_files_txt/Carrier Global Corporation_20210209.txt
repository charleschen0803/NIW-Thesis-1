CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being
carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from Carrier's website at
ir.carrier.com.

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sam Pearlstein, Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Samuel Joel Pearlstein
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Carrier's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.
With me here today are David Gitlin, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Goris, Chief
Financial Officer.

Except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding
restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature, often
referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the
earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call
are subject to risks and uncertainties. Carrier's SEC filings, including forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K provide
details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in
forward-looking statements.

This morning, we'll review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, discuss the full
year 2021 outlook, and we'll leave time for questions at the end. [Operator Instructions]

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Dave Gitlin.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter
performance on Slide 2, and Patrick will provide more color. In short, no surprises. Sales were up 2%
on a reported basis, flat organically, as residential HVAC remained very strong with a 25% year-over-
year increase. We produced $453 million of adjusted operating profit, executing on the cost actions that
we planned and communicated, including accelerated growth investment, incremental public company
costs and some onetime items that Patrick will cover. And we are very pleased with our free cash flow
generation in the quarter. Excluding the Beijer tax payment of $272 million, we would have exceeded our
forecast by about $100 million.

Importantly, we continue to consistently execute on our long-term strategic growth agenda while
maintaining strong traction on our Carrier 700 and G&A-cost reduction initiatives. All of this positions us
well for 2021 and beyond.

Turning to Slide 3. Before we dive into 2021, let me provide a broader look back at 2020. I look at 2020 as
both a foundational and a transformational year for Carrier. With the spin from UTC, it was clear that we
had a unique opportunity to create tremendous value. But to do so, we needed to create a new Carrier. We
started with our culture and took an intentional and deliberate approach to launching the Carrier Way. Our
culture reinforces our value and is centered around customers, agility, innovation, talent and winning, and
the energy level within Carrier is tremendous.

In addition to culture, we have invested in and promoted existing employees while infusing the team with
key outside talent who have brought fresh perspectives and proven leadership.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

We also launched several new initiatives designed to further enhance the agility and effectiveness of our
organization. For example, we launched Carrier Excellence, our new operating system; Carrier Alliance,
our new supply chain program; and we undertook a holistic and structural approach to driving sustained
G&A reductions and simplicity across the business.

We put a disciplined process in place to drive $600 million of recurring cost savings over 3 years, Carrier
600. And given our strong progress, we recently increased our target to $700 million under the renamed
Carrier 700.

We also dramatically improved the balance sheet since spin. We now have increased financial flexibility to
invest in growth, execute bolt-on M&A and return capital to shareholders. In December, we announced a
50% increase in the dividend, and today, we announced the share repurchase program. And we leaned
into becoming ESG leaders, committing to significant, achievable and important goals, such as by 2030,
reducing our customers' carbon footprint by more than 1 gigaton and achieving carbon-neutrality in our
operations, commitments that are not only good for the environment but also good for business.

We also made progress on our profound commitment to improving our diversity representation in creating
a truly inclusive culture. And we reframed our focus to position Carrier as a growth company.

While the COVID pandemic in 2020 presented unprecedented challenges, it also served to reinforce our
position as the world leader in healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions. With this
as our enterprise strategy, supplemented by our 3-pillar approach to driving sustained growth, we are
confident in our top line opportunities for 2021 and beyond.

Slide 4 shows the flywheel that I used in our last earnings call to help explain how our key focus areas
will drive shareholder value. As COVID shined a light on the criticality of healthy, safe and sustainable
buildings and cold chains, we acted on our ambition to become a world leader in both. There has been a
tectonic shift in how business, government and society value the safety of indoor environments and the
importance of robust systems for distributing food and medicine. There has also been a groundswell of
recent focus on sustainability, all of which represent opportunities for Carrier's business now and in the
future.

On the building side, we introduced new products like our OptiClean unit that Time Magazine recognized
as a top innovation of 2020. More recently, as part of our healthy home strategy, we introduced an air
purifier for the home. This is our first direct-to-consumer product focused on improving air quality. And
we also are now selling Carrier 1-inch filters directly to consumers. Overall, we have over $100 million of
orders for healthy building products and services and have a pipeline of more than $200 million.

The next milestone is the release of a new digital solution that we're calling [ Abound ] that will work with
building management systems to provide visibility to indoor air quality and other key healthy building
indicators. Using machine learning, this solution will connect to building control systems and auto mitigate
deficiencies. The overall goal is to work with our customers to give their patrons and tenants confidence to
reenter indoor environments.

As an example, we recently signed a sponsorship with the American Hotel & Lodging Association, where
Carrier will help define the AHLA Safe Stay guidelines for guests and staff around indoor air quality and
contactless solutions, and then we'll play our part to help hotels implement those solutions.

On the Refrigeration side, we continue to see traction on connected cold chain offerings that address the
critical challenges inherent to food and pharmaceutical distribution. Sales at our industry-leading cargo
monitoring Sensitech business were up about 10% in the fourth quarter, and we entered 2021 with a
backlog that is up over 170% over the same period last year. And we continue to push for adoption of our
cloud-based Lynx platform that we are codeveloping with AWS to extend our current digital offerings.

Our growth levers are further fueled by delivering against our 3 strategic pillars. First, in terms of growing
the core, we can say with confidence that we gain share in many of our core markets. We met our
objective of adding over 500 sales and sales support people, invested over $400 million in R&D, enabling
to introduce over 120 new products last year.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

We continue to have key new wins. Our team never needed to be pushed to win, just given the freedom
and the investments needed to get back to our market-leading routes. We also continue to push on
product extensions, such as VRF and geographic coverage, with a focus on increasing sales in China.

Our third pillar, growing services and digital, has yielded very strong initial results as we push our business
models to focus more on recurring revenues. To kickstart progress, we focused last year on our conversion
rates. That is converting new OEM units coming off warranty to long-term agreements. We started the
year at 20% conversion rates. We committed to end the year at 30%, and we did.

Going forward, our focus will be on overall coverage. That is, of our overall installed base of chillers in
the market, how many of those are under some sort of long-term agreement. Today, we have coverage
of about 50,000 units, and our plan is to increase that by about 10,000 units per year. We have similar
objectives in other parts of our business as well.

Increased coverage is enabled by digital solutions. Our truck/trailer segment launched eSolutions 2.0
with a web-based dashboard that provides critical fleet information, enhanced visibility and improved geo
fencing. And in F&S, we launched our Edwards EST4 network fire alarm and emergency communications
platform to tie multiple remote buildings together to provide more flexibility and cost-effective solutions to
our customers.

We also continue to invest in and grow our ALC building automation and controls business, where
customers have embraced our open architecture solutions. 50% of our 2020 sales in that business came
from recently introduced products. And we are complementing that with continued investments in our
channel and field network.

Performance culture and our growth mindset, we are taking a very disciplined approach to capital
allocation. In the span of just 9 months, we reduced our net debt from about $10 billion to approximately
$7 billion and ended the year with over $3 billion of cash.

Our balance sheet improvement now opens the door to bolt-on M&A. Our acquisitions will align with our
focus on healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions and more broadly with the 3 pillars
of growth that we have laid out.

Before I turn it over to Patrick, let me give you some color on how we're thinking about 2021 on Slide 5.
Our outlook for the year reflects our objective being a consistent mid-single-digit organic growth company.
We expect sales to grow 6% to 8%, and that includes 2% tailwind from FX. And with strong conversion,
we expect adjusted EPS to increase by about 14% at the midpoint. We'll continue to invest in growth,
while we project improving margins by about 70 basis points and producing strong free cash flow of about
$1.6 billion.

While we are starting this year with continued uncertainty around the global economic recovery as
the pandemic continues to impact people and economies around the world, we are optimistic that the
uncertainty will subside as we get into the second half of the year following more widespread vaccine
distribution. The good news for our first half is that our backlog is solid given the strength in orders in 4Q
that has continued very well into January.

As we get into the second half of the year, we expect some of the businesses that were acutely challenged
by the pandemic to start to recover, particularly in retail, hospitality, and small- to medium-sized
businesses.

So with that, let me now turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Good to be with you on the call today and very excited to
be part of the Carrier team. I've spent the last 2 months gaining a deeper understanding of our strengths
and the opportunities we have in front of us. I see tremendous opportunities to create value given our
focus on innovation, accelerating profitable growth, driving internal efficiencies, free cash flow generation

and capital deployment and portfolio management. I will sharpen this focus and drive execution so we can
continue to deliver long-term superior financial returns to shareowners.

Let me share some detail around the quarter. Please turn to Slide 6. As Dave discussed, Q4 was broadly in
line with our outlook. As you can see on the right side, we exceeded the outlook we gave you in October
for sales and adjusted operating profit. Sales of $4.6 billion were up 2% versus the prior year and flat
organically. Currency was a 2-point tailwind for sales in the quarter, about $100 million, but with little
profit contribution. The sales growth was driven by continued strength in our residential HVAC business,
which was up 25% in the quarter.

We saw continued sequential improvement across our other businesses. As expected, adjusted operating
profit of $453 million was down versus the prior year as Carrier 700 cost savings were more than
offset by the reversal of some temporary cost actions related to COVID-19, the expected $75 million of
investments, about $25 million of incremental public company costs and about $50 million of onetime
items in the quarter. These onetime items were about $20 million higher than we expected and included a
pre-spin vendor contract termination and legal and related costs.

Free cash flow of $38 million in the quarter included $272 million in tax payments related to the sale
of the Beijer shares. We anticipated $50 million to $60 million of that from the September sale, but the
remainder associated with the December transaction was not captured in our October outlook.

Moving on to the full year. Sales of $17.45 billion were above our most recent outlook of about $17.3
billion due to currency translation. Full year adjusted operating profit was $2.23 billion, just over our
October guidance. And excluding the tax payment for the sale of Beijer shares, we would have exceeded
our free cash flow target by about $100 million.

Let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on Slide 7. HVAC organic sales were up 4%
in the quarter driven by the 25% increase in Residential. As expected, field inventory levels have now
normalized, and we should see more typical growth trends in that business going forward but recognize
there will be a much easier compare in the first half versus the second half of 2021. Commercial HVAC
sales were down mid-single digits organically. Light commercial was down 10% and continued to lag but
the rate of decline improved sequentially.

Turning to Refrigeration. Sales of $949 million were down 3% on an organic basis but improved
sequentially. This was by far the best quarter from a year-over-year perspective for the segment.

Organic sales of the Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially in Q4 and were down
5% compared to last year. We saw a 6% decline in the product business and a 2% decrease in the field
business. Within the product businesses, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential
and commercial fire continued to be solid, while access solutions in our industrial businesses remained
challenging.

Now let me review the order activity we saw in the fourth quarter because that is important to understand
what is driving our 2021 outlook. As you can see on Slide 8, our residential and light commercial
businesses continued to see strong orders driven by residential. We intentionally worked with our channel
partners to exit 2020 with more normalized inventory levels. Backlog in residential is up almost threefold
compared to a year ago and puts us in a solid position for shipments in the first half of 2021.

Commercial HVAC orders were about flat compared to last year, and we exited 2020 with backlog up
mid-teens year-over-year. For Refrigeration, order activity for the truck/trailer business continued to
improve sequentially. North American truck/trailer orders were up well over 100% in the quarter, and
Europe was up about 10%. Container orders up almost 50%, pointing to a recovery in 2021. Commercial
Refrigeration orders were up mid-teens organically as the business is also seeing pent-up demand. Strong
order intake and backlogs exiting the year position the Refrigeration segment for the strongest growth of
the 3 segments in 2021.

Order intake for our Fire & Security segment also continued to improve sequentially. Product orders were
down low single digits. Like prior quarters, industrial end markets and global access solutions remain
weak. Field orders were up low double digits year-over-year, and we exited 2020 with record backlog for

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

installations in this business. Overall, a generally improving order trend gives us confidence in our ability
to deliver solid growth in 2021.

Please turn to Slide 9 as I walk you through our 2021 outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we
expect reported sales to be up 6% to 8%. We expect organic growth of 4% to 6% and a currency
translation tailwind of about 2%. We expect HVAC and Fire & Security organic growth to be low to mid-
single digits and expect Refrigeration to be up low teens. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand
by about 70 basis points at the midpoint to around 13.5%.

We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 25%, 1 point lower than last year. And
adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.85 and $1.95. This represents about 14% EPS growth at the
midpoint. We expect about $1.6 billion in free cash flow, which represents about 95% conversion despite
higher capital spending and about $100 million more in interest payments.

Moving to Slide 10. Let's walk through the thesis in our 2021 adjusted EPS bridge. Adjusted EPS growth
will come almost entirely from operational performance as the increased volume converts to earnings.
Core earnings conversion, which excludes the impact of currency, the 2020 Beijer sale and the 2020 Q4
items, is about 30%. We anticipate additional benefits from Carrier 700 of about $225 million in 2021 and
expect the absence of COVID-related inefficiencies and disruptions in our factories and supply chain to
benefit us by about $125 million. Offsetting that is about $200 million of cost-containment snapback and
about $150 million of planned incremental investments.

We previously talked about the 3-year plan as $100 million of investment in each year of 2020, 2021
and 2022. We are accelerating some investments into 2021 and therefore currently expect incremental
investments in 2022 to be only $50 million. We expect the net impact of pricing and input costs to be
neutral for the year. Interest expense will be a headwind in 2021. We raised most of the debt in late
February 2020, so we did not have an entire year's worth of interest expense last year.

Lastly, we currently have some restrictions in our debt covenants on the total number of shares we can
repurchase. And so while we target repurchasing about 5 million shares in 2021, the average number of
shares used for EPS in 2021 will still be above 2020. And so that represents about a $0.02 headwind '21
versus '20. Page 16 of the slide deck includes some additional items related to our 2021 outlook.

Let's shift focus to the balance sheet and our leverage profile on Slide 11. Carrier completed the spin in
April with substantial leverage. Since that time, we've been able to reduce leverage significantly through
strong free cash flow performance and the sale of our stake in Beijer. We repaid the entire $1.75 billion
term loan in the fourth quarter. And net debt adjusted EBIT -- and net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved
from about 3.4 at the time of the spin down to about 2.8 at the end of fiscal 2020. We expect 2021 year-
end net debt just north of $6 billion, which would bring our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio closer to
2.1 by the end of 2021 that is assuming no impact from potential acquisitions or divestitures. The bottom
line is that we're in a much stronger position today given the improved health of our balance sheet, which
provides more flexibility with respect to capital deployment.

That takes us to Slide 12. During 2020, it was clear that the focus had to be on reducing leverage. As
we enter 2021, we plan a more balanced capital deployment while remaining within our overall capital
structure of an investment-grade credit rating. We expect 2021 CapEx to be about $375 million.

Dave talked about some of our priorities with respect to inorganic investments. We're not putting a dollar
amount placeholder here, but we will be opportunistic on bolt-on M&A that help achieve our strategic
objectives and meet our financial criteria. We plan to reduce debt by $500 million in 2021, and in light of
our pending redemption, we will not have any debt maturing until 2025.

In December, we announced a dividend increase, and we now expect 2021 dividend payments to amount
to about $425 million. And today, the Board authorized a share repurchase program of $350 million, and
our outlook for '21 incorporates repurchasing about 5 million shares this year.

Before I turn it back to Dave, let me just add that the volatile quarters in 2020 should lead to some
unusual comparisons in 2021. We expect strong double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2021 and
closer to flat organic performance in the second half given the residential comparisons. In addition, we

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

expect the first quarter to have the lowest incremental margins for the year, probably in the high teens,
due to having more Beijer income in last year's Q1 than other quarters, a larger currency conversion
headwind and some prior year deferred comp favorable items.

With that, I'll turn it back to Dave.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Okay. Thank you, Patrick. Our results demonstrate that we successfully navigated through 2020. We
remain focused on driving key strategic growth initiatives alongside aggressive cost actions that will fuel
future investment and innovation. Our balance sheet improvement provides additional flexibility to create
shareholder value through bolt-on M&A, dividends and share buyback. All of these factors, combined with
the tailwinds from important megatrends, position us well for strong top and bottom line growth in 2021
and beyond.
So with that, we'll open this up for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.

Stephen Edward Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Hoping you can just talk a little bit more about the commercial HVAC business. Obviously, strong backlog
headed into '21. But orders kind of flattish. Maybe you can give us a little bit more color, either by market
or by type of product or anything to sort of give us a sense of the cadence on commercial HVAC.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Steve. Yes, we are pleased with the backlog being up in the mid-teens. But clearly, there are some
watch items there. The ABI being at about 43 in December has been below since -- 50 since April. So we
have a watch on it. Remember that commercial new construction is about 15% of our overall business.
The things that give us a lot of confidence are some verticals remain very strong globally. Data centers,
warehouses, education, health care have all been strong.

Number two is we are seeing traction in our whole focus on indoor air quality, healthy buildings. We have
a pipeline of $200 million there. So it's clearly a watch item, particularly North America. I was pleased --
China has continued to be strong. Europe we actually saw coming back. You may recall earlier in '20, I felt
like we weren't gaining the share in Europe that we had been in North America, China. The team made a
number of changes in Europe, and we're seeing traction there.

So signs of life in Europe, orders were up about 5% there in the fourth quarter. Asia Pacific actually
showing a bit of strength towards the end of last year for the first time in 8 or 9 months. So signs
of progress, but clearly, a couple of watch items, probably the biggest being North American new
construction.

Stephen Edward Volkmann
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. That's helpful. And do you feel like people are able to get out into the field now and do more of the
kind of service, maintenance upgrade stuff that is -- probably sort of represents pent-up demand for '21?
Or is that still on the come?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

No, we do. The good news for the aftermarket is that we actually come in -- HVAC services backlog ended
Europe about 20%. So we are seeing people get out there, even in Europe, where it's a bit spotty and
some markets are more closed than others. Even though they've been distributing the vaccine in England,
we still see some pockets of closed-down locations there, same with Germany.

But by and large, we are getting our field support and our technicians out into buildings, certainly in the
United States. So we're looking at double-digit HVAC aftermarket growth in 2020, and it'll be fueled by
folks getting back into the buildings.

Operator

Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

Can you guys maybe provide a little bit more color around the $50 million charge that you took this
quarter and then whether all of that came through on HVAC margins this quarter?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Joe. Patrick here. So really one big item as part of those onetime items is a, as I mentioned, a vendor
contract renegotiation. Think of it as a pre-spin contract that we had from another UTC umbrella. We think
we can do better than that specific contract, so we decided to terminate it. There were costs associated
with that, that we incurred in the quarter. We'll benefit from that in future years. And the NPV, obviously,
was positive on that transaction. That was by far the biggest item within the $50 million.

And I would say that clearly, HVAC had the biggest part of that onetime cost of about $50 million in the
quarter. So clearly, HVAC's margins were impacted by that more than the other segments.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's helpful, Patrick. And maybe I might just -- my one follow-up, maybe just sticking with HVAC
margins. I think that was probably the area where we're hearing the most from investors today. Can you
guys just kind of parse out what really kind of happened within the quarter outside of this one contract?
Because margins still would have been down outside of you seeing growth in the quarter. And I recognize
that you spent about $75 million in investment. But maybe just kind of parse out what were the kind of
the key drivers for the margins in HVAC this quarter?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Sure. So within HVAC, currency helped us -- currency translation was a tailwind on sales of about $40
million but basically with no operating profit's contribution. We did see a benefit of the higher volume,
particularly in resi, which was up 25%.

Mix was actually a headwind in the quarter. And actually, that relates to commercial HVAC. The applied
equipment piece of commercial HVAC returned to growth. We saw that up low single digit, which is a good
thing. We saw good growth in China. We have not yet seen service and aftermarket return to growth.
Service and aftermarket was down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. They tend to have better margins.
Now the good thing is backlog for service and aftermarket was up double digits for us in the quarter. So
that bodes well for future periods.

Other items that impacted the HVAC margins in the quarter. One, you referred to investments.
Investments were up $75 million in the quarter for the overall company. HVAC saw the vast majority of
that. And so that, together with the one-timers that I referred to earlier, is really the story around HVAC
margins. For next year, we expect for the full year HVAC margins to be close to 16%.

Operator

Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

Nigel Edward Coe

So I think we just kind of addressed the HVAC margin issue quite well. But when you say the vast majority
of the investment spending, are we talking about like over $50 million of that $75 million would have been
within that segment? Just trying to size the impact of that investment spend.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. North of $50 million would have impacted HVAC, Nigel.

And then the nature of this investment spending, is this primarily headcount spending? And I'm wondering
if the carryforward of that $150 million, if it's mainly just the annualization of whatever's being spent in
the second half of this year?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes, Nigel. Nigel, it's Dave. Yes, recall that we really look at our investments in 3 categories. We said that
we'd add -- the first is selling and salespeople. We said we'd add 500 sales and sales support people last
year. We ended up adding more like 550. And a lot of that, we started to see in the fourth quarter.

We also invested in R&D. That was a big chunk of it. We had tapped the brakes a little bit on some of
our investments in 2Q. We started to release it in 3Q and to 4Q. So we did accelerate R&D investments.
And also, the third piece is digital. A little bit less than the R&D side, but we're going to come out with
some new digital products here at the beginning of the second quarter, especially tied into healthy
buildings. So we really try to lean forward because that's what we see as one of the most transformational
opportunities. It has to be -- it has to do with a digital offering that's going to be an extraction layer that
has -- that gives customers visibility into things like indoor air quality. So we really accelerated some of
our investments there in the fourth quarter.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

And then Nigel, of the $150 million, about half of it would be carryover from investments made late in
2020.

One question is on service attach initiatives. You point towards a significant increase in the installed
base of chillers being serviced. What is driving that uptick? What are you doing differently today that
you weren't doing this time last year? And then secondly, as part of that, would you be pointing towards
double-digit service growth going forward?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Well, certainly, we feel positive about double-digit service growth in '21, and we'll have to see as we get
into '22 and beyond. But you look at that we have a relatively small percentage of our, say, chillers under
some form of long-term agreement. It's less than 25%. And the reality is it should be something that's
exponentially higher. One of the ways to do it is having those chillers be connected. So we're going out
of our way to add edge devices to the chiller. So we can have more of a 2-way communication with the
customer, so we cannot only do things like diagnostics and prognostics but other value-added services,
such as energy efficiency through making the devices connected. So connecting the devices is one.

Adding the salespeople is another key one. One of the reasons we were successful in our conversion rates
last year was simply putting people in the building, working with the building operator to say, while it's
under warranty or while it's under an agreement with someone else, there's value-added services that we
can provide. So increasing our sales forces in a very targeted way.

So for example, in China, at some of the Tier 2 cities, in the North America in some of the underserved
regions that we have today. So really, it's a lot of blocking and tackling. I am very confident in the double-
digit aftermarket growth this year.

Vertical Research Partners, LLC

I was wondering if you could address a little bit more of what you're expecting on the price cost side? Was
it an issue in the quarter? You did go through a lot of the margin dynamics in Q4, but I don't think you
mentioned price cost. But more importantly, as you look forward into 2021, what do you see and what do
you have modeled?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes, Jeff. For 2020, price realization was really about flat. Obviously, for '21, we're very closely monitoring
commodity prices, especially steel, copper, aluminum. We expect price to offset commodity inflation in
2021. We announced our price increase during the normal cycle, which is early in our first quarter.

And then from a blocking or locking point of view, currently, over 75% of our 2021 requirements are
locked or blocked. If prices stay high, of course, this could be a watch item for 2022. But we'll be
continuing to look at this closely and looking, of course, at continued recovery through pricing as well. So
overall, neutral for fiscal '21.

Jeffrey Todd Sprague
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And I'm also just wondering kind of [ new co independent Carrier ]. You provided in the appendix kind of
the outlook on corporate expense and the like. Are we largely at run rate, though, coming out of Q4 on
public company costs, anything that's left over on TSAs, that sort of thing? Maybe you could just address
what, if any, kind of nuances or headwinds we should be thinking about as you kind of get into your full --
first full independent year here.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Jeff, I think this will be de minimis in fiscal 2021. There might be a little bit in the first quarter but
really not a big number for the full year.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

And I would add, Jeff, that, look, we've been clear that our G&A is just too high. So it's -- we have a
very structured focus around taking G&A out. It's not something that you can kind of do the right way
overnight. What we're trying to do rather than just give kind of headcount targets or things like that, we're
trying to make structural changes. We have a leader that reports to me, Eva Azoulay, who's leading a
whole low-cost Center of Excellence approach. We're outsourcing some aspects. We're moving some of the
work to low-cost CoEs, and we're really trying to reduce our G&A in a structured way. '21 is a lot of putting
that in place. So we'll start to see a lot of the benefit of it as we get into '22 and beyond.

So our G&A should come down for sure. And $100 million of the Carrier 700 is G&A. So we expect to start
seeing that drop through certainly as we get into '22.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then what did Carrier 700 ultimately come in at for the year on the benefits side?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Carrier 700 came in at $250 million in fiscal '20, we expect '21 to be about $225 million.

Charles Stephen Tusa
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then just one more on resi. You said your backlog was up like 3x. Is there any buy in
there ahead of those price increases that's influencing that number? I mean that just seems like a pretty
big number for December -- the year-end December 31.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Certainly, we were pleased with backlog coming in 3x higher than it was at the same time last year,
Steve. What we've really worked very purposefully on with our distributors is to make sure that we were
trying to match our flow to them with their movement to the dealer base.

So as Patrick said, we had sales in the fourth quarter up 25%. Movement from the distributors into the
dealers was about 20%. Inventory was up around 10% coming out of last year into this year, so fairly
normalized. We saw order strength continue to be very, very strong in January.

Now part of it is that you know that we have a good position with new home construction. That was up
about 8% last year. We expect it to continue to be strong this year. But we're working very closely with
our channel partners to make sure that we're giving them what they need, when they need it.

And there's just a lot of demand in the system, but we're trying to modulate that to make sure we're there
to support them so they can support the dealer network.

So Slide 10, great color on the different moving pieces in cost. Just wondering how you think of cadence

impact kind of cadence and incrementals as you kind of move through the year?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Jeff, I think from an investment point of view, you can expect that to be fairly even throughout
the year in 2021. From an incremental point of view, as I mentioned, Q1, a little weaker than the other
quarters.

Jeffrey David Hammond
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then just on kind of the first half, second half, I understand -- I mean I guess the things have
been -- were improving through 2020. But outside of residential being so strong in the second half, where
else do you see "tough comps" to kind of get you to that flat dynamic in the second half?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

I think it's really driven by residential in the second half. So obviously, we had a very strong resi second
half in 2020 with very high-growth rates. As we lap these, some of those headwinds get partially -- get
offset by what we expect to be a pickup in light commercial, commercial HVAC and our Fire & Security
business. And so that's really the -- what we're counting on in the second half of the year that there is a
recovery related to COVID that helps offset some of those headwinds in resi.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. Jeff, I'd add that I think we really view this as a tale of 2 halves. You look at the first half, we're
coming in with very strong backlogs. Orders, Patrick mentioned, were up 15% in the fourth quarter. Some
were quite high, like in our transport refrigeration business, very strong there. So we like our opening
backlog position. Orders continue to be very strong in January almost across the portfolio.

So we expect that the backlog in orders that carry us through the first half, clearly, you have the
compares. But as you get in the second half, there's pent-up demand in some of the key verticals that
have been acutely challenged. So our light commercial business, we start -- we would expect to see
recovery as we get into the second half of this year.

You start looking at some parts of our Fire & Security business that were hurt by small- and medium-sized
businesses and the impact of retail and some of the big-box retail impacts that we've seen. So we expect
that first half carry through with backlog. Second half, as economies start to reopen and there's some
pent-up demand, we expect that to give us some lift in the second half. Tough compares, but progress in
some acutely impacted verticals.

Jeffrey David Hammond
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. If I could sneak one more in. Just sell-in versus sell-through, your sense for residential as you look
at your independents or just kind of what your distributors are telling you what sell-through was in 4Q?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Well, we looked at -- we were looking at 20% movement in 4Q from our distributors into the dealers. So
we were trying very hard to really match our sell-in and sell-out. It was a little bit higher on what we sold
to them than what they moved out but not materially so.

There is significant demand in the channel. I would say that one thing that is positive is that we have
gained share. It's always complicated when you look at share on a quarter-to-quarter basis with all the
different moving parts on selling either direct to dealers or selling through independent distribution. But
if you just step back and look at 2020 as a whole, our resi sales were up 10%, and you're looking at
probably a market that was up 7% to 8%. So we feel positive that we're gaining share the right way. Our
partnership with our distribution partners has been very positive.

New construction is -- new home construction has been positive. So we feel positive about where we are
and where we're going on resi. And we're trying to be very careful to not get out over our skis ourselves or
our distribution partners.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Dave, congrats on being named Chairman.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Deane. I appreciate that.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

First question for Patrick. You don't often hear about covenants that restrict buybacks. I know it does
happen, but the expectation, if you're going to be 2.1 net leverage by year-end, you would think those
covenants would not be in play and maybe they can get rolled back. I know you negotiated covenants last
year. Might this be an opportunity as well?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Under our current covenants, we have those restrictions, and those remain there till the end of the
year. We could decide to renegotiate them. The other factor that's at play here is that of our current
capital structure, we're kind of growing into our existing credit ratings.

And so by the end of the year, our capital structure will be much more aligned with our existing credit
rating. And so this would not be the time to buyback significantly more shares as we're trying -- as we're
still working our way into our existing credit rating. And so that's the other element that's at play here,
Deane.

We could renegotiate it, but there is still the credit rating that's in play as well, and it's clearly our
intention to remain a solid credit rating company.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

I appreciate that. And just if you could expand on the opportunities in bolt-on M&A. It's interesting. The
covenants don't restrict that, it would appear. Just what's the funnel look like, especially like across the
product lines?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Deane, we're in the process of building up that pipeline. We've had some that we've been working. We're
adding more to the pipeline. So it's something that, as we continue to look at the portfolio, there's still
some things that we would say -- that we're assessing whether or not they would be of more value in the
hands of others.

And then we look at our overall strategic priorities. Healthy, safe and sustainable buildings is a big
ecosystem. The cold chain is another ecosystem, our 3 pillars of growth. We want to grow the core. We
want to look at adjacencies. We're underrepresented in China. We're underrepresented in VRF. So those
are areas. And anything that builds out our services and aftermarket offerings as we continue to shift to
recurring revenue. So we have some things in the pipeline that we've been working. We're trying to add to
that pipeline as we go.

Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So lots of great color on the quarter, as always. One thing that was a little surprising is looking at the
order trends. It looks like APAC outside of China was actually stronger than China in terms of orders.
Can you talk about what drove that strength in APAC outside of China and how you're thinking about the
sustainability of the strong order growth in the APAC region?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I would say that the whole Southeast Asia, it's still fragile. I mean it actually caught us a bit by
surprise because it had been quite negative in the second and third quarter. Even places like India, we
started to see traction; other places, Singapore, Australia. Hong Kong is still a mixed bag because of a
multitude of reasons there. But we were pleasantly surprised by some of the traction we started to see in
parts of Asia outside of China.

And look, China has just remained just continuously strong really across the portfolio: on the cold chain
side, both in commercial refrigeration and transport refrigeration. Overall, look at Carrier, our China -- in
the fourth quarter, China sales were up 10%. Orders were up about 5% in China, particularly strong in
Refrigeration, where it was up about 20%. So we remain very, very bullish on China overall, and it was
nice to see progress in Southeast Asia, but it's still a watch item. We got to see more vaccine distribution
in places like India, and then we'll get more confidence on the sustainability.

Vladimir Benjamin Bystricky
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the '21 free cash flow outlook, can you just
maybe help to level set us in terms of how you're thinking about the seasonality of free cash flow in 2021?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Vlad, we would expect and which is typical for our business at the first quarter would be our weakest
quarter of free cash flow and that the second half would generally be stronger than the first half. So
generally, Q1 would expect to be our lowest quarter of free cash flow, followed by stronger quarters
and a significantly stronger second half than the first half. And that's, of course, related to some of the
seasonality in our business, especially in HVAC.

Vladimir Benjamin Bystricky

Right. So more typical seasonality than we normally see.

Correct.

Maybe just trying to home in a little bit on the Q1 context and understand that, in general, this year's
seasonality maybe a little bit different, at least on earnings, if not cash flow than normal. So any extra
color on that?

But if I start with Q1, you've mentioned the high-teens incremental that compares with, I guess, the full
year guide of more like 25%. For revenues in Q1, should we be thinking that sort of up high single digit?

CARRIER GLOBAL CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 09, 2021

And so you end up with about 50 bps of margin expansion against 70 bps for the year as a whole? Is that
roughly the right framework?

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We do expect double-digit organic growth in the first quarter, and we do expect margin expansion as
well in the first quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we think that the timing of the investment is pretty
even throughout the year.

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

And also, Julian, again, because of the strong Q4 orders that continued into January, our coverage for Q1
is solid. So we feel positive about that.

Julian C.H. Mitchell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

And then just thinking about the free cash flow guide for the year as a whole, understood the context
on seasonality that you just provided, Patrick. But for the year as a whole, if I back out the Beijer tax
payments, it looks like you're guiding for around flattish operating cash flow year-on-year in '21. Just
wondered about any moving parts within that. You had that $100 million interest expense, I think, called
out. Maybe help us understand what you're dialing in for the working capital scale of headwind.

Patrick P. Goris
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. Actually -- so for the full year, free cash flow, we expect it to be about flat year-over-year. You --
obviously, adjusted net income is expected to be up year-over-year. That's a tailwind there.

There are 2 items that are large offsets. You mentioned one of them. Interest payable is -- we will make
an extra $100 million of interest payments. And in CapEx, we expect also to be up about $65 million. And
so that offsets most of the adjusted net income.

We do expect working capital overall to be a slight tailwind. On the headwinds associated with free cash
flow, we expect comp and benefits to be a little bit of a headwind there in fiscal '21. But those are the
biggest pieces. It's really higher adjusted income, offset by $100 million extra interest payment and $65
million additional CapEx. And then the minor items make it about flat year-over-year.

Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.

impact on your long-term view of that business?

David L. Gitlin

Yes. I'd look at it. The -- it impacted Kidde as we start to see some of the brick-and-mortar -- we saw very
strong e-commerce sales in our residential smoke detector business, but we did see an impact on more
of the brick-and-mortar piece of that business. So we are expecting with the vaccine distribution some
recovery there as we get into the latter part of 2021.

Another piece of the business is some of the security portfolio that -- some of that piece of that business
is tied a little bit to more towards SMB and small- and medium-sized businesses. So if you take our S2

the SMB side of the business as we get into the second half of the year.

Unknown Analyst

Okay. So you would expect the pent-up demand aspect to be stronger than, say, like, I don't know -- what
do they say, like 1/3 of restaurants may have closed permanently now?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I mean I think, look, the restaurant closures, I mean, it's something that we watch not only for our
Fire & Security business but our light commercial business. We look at that business that was down 10%
in the fourth quarter, and we have that business up mid-single digits this year. So we do -- clearly, there's
been a big impact on that whole industry, but we do expect to see some pent-up demand as people start
to reenter society in the second half of the year.

Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Dave, first question on service versus equipment in commercial. I think maybe relative to some of your
peers out there, this looks a little bit more sanguine on service and saw equipment kind of lagging behind.
You seem to have a bit of the opposite experience. But I know you're still sort of working your way up
the curve on service market share. Is there something about, either the timing of being able to actually
schedule that or the nature of the service you guys are winning, that would suggest that there's sort of
a lag? Just curious that that building access phenomenon, I suspect, is kind of similar for everybody, and
that seems to be impacting you more, but you're doing better on equipment. A lot of moving pieces there,
but I guess it kind of comes down to how do you feel about either timing or kind of the nature of service
maybe versus the broader market?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Yes. On the equipment side, look, we've added the salespeople. We've introduced some new products. It's
not really putting a new machine, a new construct in place. It was really accelerating, doing what we know
how to do with more focus and energy. So the ability to turn that in an effective way has been positive and
a bit easier than it has been on the aftermarket for us because it hasn't traditionally been as big of a focus
area for us as it has been perhaps for a couple of our peers that have done well in this area.

So I would say on the aftermarket, we added a new Head of Aftermarket, Ajay Agrawal. He's been working
tightly with the new heads of aftermarket that we put in place in the BUs and the BU Presidents. And now
we put in place a playbook that we know works, but it's not a playbook that you can affect overnight. So
adding the sales and sales support people, adding a BlueEdge-tiered offering, adding digital offerings that
can really differentiate the overall offerings.

So a lot of this playbook of how we think about pricing parts and how we can provide more value-added
services to our customers, that playbook is in the process of being rolled out. But when we talk about
a 20% increase in our chiller coverage this year, that's a pretty big percentage. And a lot of 2020 was
putting that foundation in place. 2021 for us is the show-me year. And now we got to kind of go realize a
lot of that foundation that we put in place last year.

Okay. And then on the portfolio side, clearly, asset prices are high out there. I know parts of Fire &
Security, namely Chubb, got a peek under the hood a couple of years ago now. What's the appetite to
maybe explore some dispositions just given that multiples are fairly high in the marketplace?

David L. Gitlin
CEO, President & Director

Look, we've -- we said consistently that we would be very objective as we look at our current portfolio,
and that's continued. We started that process day 1, and that's going to continue really forever. So we
look at all aspects of the portfolio, whether they're worth more to someone else than they are to us and
whether they fit in our long-term strategy.

And that applies -- I mean you mentioned Chubb. It applies really across the board. So we will continue
to assess. We will continue to do what's right for our shareholders. If we make that determination, we will
look at what to sell and what's the right time to sell. And then the exciting thing for me is that we now
have the balance sheet flexibility to start looking more aggressively at bolt-on M&A. So we're hopeful to
see some of that in '21 as well.
