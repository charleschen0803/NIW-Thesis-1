CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the CME Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. Today's
conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Peschier.
Please go ahead.

John C. Peschier
Managing Director of Investor Relations

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to start with the safe harbor language,
and I'll turn it over to Terry and John for brief remarks followed by your questions. Other members of our
management team will also participate in the Q&A session. Statements made on this call and in other
reference documents on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These
statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions
that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is
expressed or implied in any statement.

Detailed information about factors that may affect our performance can be found in the filings with
the SEC, which are on our website. Lastly, on the final page of the earnings release, you will see a
reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Our comments will be brief, as John said,
so we can direct your questions. I hope you and your families are all staying safe and healthy. We released
our executive summary this morning, which provides extensive details on the fourth quarter and 2020.
As John said, I have John; Sean; Derek; Sunil; and Julie Winkler here with me this morning, and we look
forward to addressing any questions that you may have. 2020 was a challenge with low volatility in several
asset classes, including the front end of the rate curve and in our WTI contract for much of the year. We
did see some very encouraging signs with some of our higher-rate-per-contract products. Also, during
2020, metals had its fifth consecutive year of record annual volume and is off to a strong start in 2021.
We saw very strong activity in our agricultural commodities in the fourth quarter, and they continued to
rise in the first month of this year, up 36% versus last year.

Soybean Futures had its second-highest quarterly ADV, including record volume out of both Europe and
Asia. After the extreme volatility of the first quarter of 2020, as the pandemic began the volume -- the
total volume came in at 15.6 million contracts per day in the third quarter and jumped to 16.2 million
contracts per day in Q4. During this entire time, we have remained heavily engaged with our global
customers. During 2020, our volume from clients outside the United States grew by 7%, reflecting the
global relevance of our markets. I am encouraged by the January 2021 volume, which came in at more
than 19 million contracts per day. We are very pleased with the progress we've made integrating the
NEX business during 2020, including back-office migrations, to support finance and HR systems and the
building of an integrated global sales team.

Last week, we announced that BrokerTec has migrated to U.S. Treasury benchmark trading in EU
government bond and repo markets onto Globex. With BrokerTec's dealer-to-dealer platform, now a fully
integrated part of CME Globex, clients have an enhanced suite of government bond trading offerings
across listed derivatives, cash and repo markets on a common platform, allowing greater operational and
technological efficiencies when managing a risk across cash and futures. We remain excited about the
mitigation -- or I should say, migration, excuse me, of EBS onto Globex by year-end and the ability to
provide further efficiencies to our global customers in the FX market. During 2020 and the first quarter of
this year, we have continued to innovate with several new products and will begin trading global emission
offset contracts referred to as GEO futures on March 1. And we just launched our new Ether futures earlier

this week. We continue to work closely with our global customer base on solutions to help them manage
their risks.

These new products build on globally relevant products we have delivered recently, including SOFR
futures, even the S&P ESG futures, the South American Soybean contract, Cobalt futures, Options on our
popular Bitcoin futures and the popular micro products across several of our asset classes. With that, let
me turn it over to John, who will discuss the financial results. John?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Terry. Throughout 2020, we navigated the difficult operating environment, executed on the
integration with NEX, launched new and innovative products and actively managed our expenses. For
the year, we delivered $4.9 billion in revenue, up slightly from the prior year, and with a strong focus on
expenses, we achieved $6.72 in adjusted diluted EPS. During the year, we announced our annual variable
dividend of $2.50 per share, and we recently announced a regular dividend of $0.90 per share for the
first quarter of 2021, a 6% increase compared to the first quarter last year. In terms of fourth quarter
revenue, our average rate per contract across the product areas were fairly stable with our micro contracts
continuing to perform well across several asset classes. Market data revenue was very strong, with an all-
time quarterly high of $140 million and was up over 7% compared to Q4 last year.

We were intensely focused on expense management throughout the year. At the beginning of 2020, we
provided guidance for adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees of between $1.64 billion and
$1.65 billion. For the year, we came in approximately $90 million below the midpoint of that range and
$80 million below 2019 levels at $1.557 billion. In terms of synergies, we had initially targeted $110
million in run rate synergies by the end of 2020 related to the next acquisition. By year-end, we had
exceeded that target and achieved a total of $140 million in synergies. This is net of the additional costs
that we are carrying to run parallel infrastructures as we continue to work on the migrations to Globex. We
remain committed to our target of $200 million of annual run rate synergies by the end of 2021.

Turning to guidance. For 2021, we currently expect full year adjusted operating expenses, excluding
license fees, to increase slightly from the already low 2020 levels to $1.575 billion. For capital
expenditures, excluding onetime integration costs and net of leasehold improvement allowances, we
expect to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million. In addition, we expect our 2021 adjusted
effective tax rate to be between 23.2% and 24.2%. Finally, we are very excited about the recently
announced joint venture with IHS Markit and the opportunities that it will provide our clients and our
shareholders. The JV will be a leader in trade processing and risk mitigation services that offers the
combined clients complementary services across the global OTC marketplace and interest rate, FX, equity
and credit asset classes. We don't anticipate any material change to earnings as a result of the JV. We will
provide more information when the transaction closes.
With that short summary, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Based on the number of
analysts covering us, please limit yourself to one question, and then feel free to jump back into the queue.
Thank you.

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler.

Richard Henry Repetto
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

John, and I hope everyone at CME is safe and healthy as well. Hopefully, we're seeing some light at the
end of the tunnel here. My question is on the expense side, John. Just trying to understand, you gave out
that, I believe, was $35 million you expect to have the P&L impact of the synergies in 2021. Can you tell
us what the P&L impact the actual realized synergies in 2020 were? And also what you're assuming for
COVID expenses, or COVID environment, I guess, that expenses and sales and everything stay refrained
or restricted throughout the full year? So those are the 2 questions.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Great. Thanks, Rich. Thank you very much. Yes, in terms of the synergies, we are anticipating achieving
the $200 million run rate synergies by the end of this year. So if you take a look at where we're at in
terms of run rate synergies, we had originally targeted $50 million in the first year, we achieved $64
million. We had targeted $110 million by the end of this year and achieved $140 million, and we're
planning on achieving the full $200 million by the end of this year. So if you look at it on a year-by-year
basis, we overachieved by -- in terms of run rate synergies, by $14 million last year in 2000 -- by the end
of 2019, and again, overachieved by approximately the same amount this year. We overachieved by about
$16 million this year, in terms of run rate synergies.

In terms of P&L, we anticipate our synergies being realized in our income statement in 2021 of $35
million. And so that is what we expect to have in our P&L. This is being offset by additional costs that we
anticipate having in terms of increased depreciation related to our migrations onto Globex, so the way
that works is that we do some programming that goes into work in process and that goes from work in
process into production and when it goes into production then that's amortized over several years. We
also are building out our data center and disaster recovery center on the East Coast. That's partially being
offset by the synergy capture. And lastly, in terms of our impacts, we do anticipate having some improved
environment in terms of operating environment towards the back half of this year, and we anticipate
having about $20 million in additional costs that we didn't have this year that we are building into the back
half of 2021 related primarily to travel, marketing and events. So that's the story for 2021.

Operator

We'll move on to our next question from Alex Kramm of UBS.

Alexander Kramm
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Can you touch on BrokerTec a little bit more now that the migration is complete. A couple of things. One,
what should we be expecting from this combination now to drive in terms of any sort of upside on either
side? But then, I think, Terry, last quarter, you made a comment that as you improve kind of the offering
to your clients, that obviously you want to compensate it for that. So any details on any pricing changes
you're contemplating? Or anything that should impact the financials more directly outside of more activity?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Let me go ahead and ask Sean to make some comments on that, and then the rest of us might jump
in as well, Alex. So thank you. Sean?

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes. Thank you, Alex, and thank you, Terry. We are very excited about the migration of BrokerTec over
to the Globex platform. I think I've spoken about before, but I'll mention it now. We are very excited, in
particular, with the new technology of being able to offer new products and services, in particular, the new
RV or relative value curve trading order type. So we're are -- why are we very excited about this? Curve
trades, spreads, very popular, especially in this market. And this new order type will allow you to reduce
the risk of trading that order type by eliminating the neutral ag transactions, one. Two, we are going to
reduce the minimum price increments in the spreads relative to the outrights. And then three, we're going
to have CME Globex implied to functionality, which means that when you have a spread order, let's say,
between 2-year notes and 5-year notes, and you've got outright orders in 2-year notes that then should
theoretically, but not only theoretically actually does on Globex imply outright orders in 5-year notes.

So we're very excited about the new RV technology where we launched that in March. Shortly thereafter,
we're also going to be reducing the known pricing come in those 2-year notes. We've got a total of 7
different initiatives that we will be taking in order to make that platform more attractive relative to
alternatives. And in terms of pricing, I guess, I'm most focused on making sure that the platform is more
valuable to our clients, and then we get more volume over our platform, and that's really our focus. And
Terry, I don't know if you want to jump in?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

No, I think that answered it. Alex did that comment. I didn't hear the other part of your question, if you
have something on me?

Alexander Kramm
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

No, I think you got both of it.

Operator

We now move on to our next question from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.

Daniel Thomas Fannon
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So market data was an area of strength in 2020. And I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that
the record sales pipeline as you kind of exiting the year. So thinking -- how could we think about growth
in 2021 and potential pricing changes as well as the demand side, as you think about the build on the
success you had this past year?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Dan. Let me ask Julie Winkler who runs that division to make some comments on market data.
Julie?

Julie Winkler
Senior MD & Chief Commercial Officer

Yes. Thank you for the question, Dan. Yes, we did have a record year as data services. Our revenue being
up 5% year-on-year. Yes, I think that work from home environment kind of further highlighted that need
for real-time data access really across our global client base.

As well as the need for historical data, right, as we evaluated really the impacts of the volatile market
conditions that we saw in Q2. We also made some investments in our business last year. And so bringing
that data business closer to our commercial capabilities. We established a data sales team, and we
also supported a number of new products and services. And so that's where we really feel kind of that
continued investment is certainly helping to grow the data business and positioning us well as we head

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

into 2021. Those solid trends, we continue to see in the professional subscriber device count was strong
throughout the quarter. And in Q4, revenue was up 7% compared to where we were in Q4 2019. And so I
think it's a strong -- definitely global demand as well as things on the drive data front that are really kind
of propelling the business.

And this is just that longer-term trend that we've talked about on other calls of customers' use of
technology and their trading strategies is increasing the need for our data through a number of these
nondisplay use cases. So we did have some minor fee adjustments that are being made in 2021. To really
reflect how our customers are utilizing our data now and also just the value of the data that we offer
and the services that we have and how our market data customers are really receiving and expecting
to receive that data. So there was a $5 increase to our real-time data from $105 to $110 per DCM per
month. That goes into effect in April. And then we also had some pricing changes on the nondisplay and
historical redistribution side. And those will kind of trickle in throughout the year since there's certainly
some licensing and implementation that will need to be done between ourselves and our customers. But
we feel well that we're in a good position. And as we onboard those customers and that we're really going
to be in a good position to continue to grow the business going forward.

Operator

We now move on to our next question from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Great. Hope everyone is well as well. The question is on retail participation. Obviously, we're seeing
that increase in the market, especially in equities and options, but also in futures, Schwab talked about
leveraging Ameritrade capabilities in futures to the Schwab client base. Maybe if you could just give us
some perspective on either the portion of ADV or revenue that you think is coming from retail now and
some initiatives? And where do you think that might be going in '21 and initiatives that you're working
on in terms of conversations with retail providers like online brokers and also, obviously, you've been
developing the micro complex. Maybe if you can talk about other product extensions across the micro
complex that could help that as well.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Brian. And let me ask Julie to comment and then I'll comment as well as it relates to what we
think is on a go-forward basis, but you can give an idea of some of the flows, Julie.

Julie Holzrichter
Senior MD & COO

Yes. Sure. Thanks, Terry. And a lot of questions in there, so I will start and then hand things back to
Terry. So I really think -- and you mentioned it, a couple of our broker partners in your question, and it's
really because of that strong broker distribution network, the vast educational programs and really the
content that we support, the diverse product mix that we were in a really good position to be able to take
advantage of the increase in overall retail trading in 2020. We saw record levels of participation in revenue
globally. And the number of retail traders that were active at CME Group last year increased over 50%.
And so the biggest gains were definitely on the equity index product side, where the volatility there really
led to a lot of increased trading opportunities. And we also saw great year-on-year gains in metals that
were up over 20%, FX as well as ag. And that really speaks to, again, the diverse product mix and the fact
that people are looking for different opportunities.

We have been investing quite a bit in our sales and marketing staff overseas, both in APAC and EMEA. And
those are playing also a large role as we've grown the business globally on the retail side. So we saw both
APAC and EMEA retail business was up double digits. Countries of strong growth continue to be: Korea;
Taiwan; and Singapore; and then Germany; and Switzerland; and Europe. So I think that -- the work-
from-home environment has allowed, I think, the potential, right, for even more retail customers become
active. And our digital outreach, I think, was also just a real positive trend last year because we're able to

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

just reach more retail and active traders than ever before and so the efforts through our education helped
us reach over 2.5 million new active individual traders throughout the broker partner digital events that
we have that were focused specifically on CME Group products.

The largest growth in Asia, we had events that -- the number of events increased over 65% over 2019,
so well over 400 events and by going digital, we reach 15x more active traders than we have in the
past when more of those events were in person, and also we're seeing somewhat strong trends in North
America where the firms there were growing their webinar output by 225%. So we feel that this continued
investment is leading us to have well-educated retail traders, and that really kind of helps position us for
continued success. And with that, I'll maybe turn it over to Terry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Julie. You answered a lot of the questions, but let me just add a little bit, and I'm going to ask
John to comment a little bit on the cost of some of these products, too. It's really hard for us to predict,
Brian, what we think 2021 future volumes are for any particular constituent or market participant going
forward. But it doesn't take the last several weeks for us to think about the growth of retail trading. So
I don't -- that's not the reason why we talk about retail trading. As you know, we've been building on
this business for a number of years. But it's become more and more clear that, in my opinion, that retail
traders want to have a -- participate in all different forms of markets. We are looking at all different ways
to allow them to come into our markets.

As Julie referenced, education is key though. He talked a little bit about the micros and the growth of
them. We are looking at other ways to continually work with our partners to bring in more and more retail
participants. It's just one of those things that's not going away. I don't believe it's going away. And I don't
say that because of what happened with the run-up in some of the recent equities or even in what they
perceive as running up in the silver. You can talk about fundamental stories that are in silver versus not
fundamental stories of some of the other products that had runs on them. But there's no question about
it that the proliferation of social media, the proliferation of access to marketplaces is allowing people to
participate more and more, and they want to do that. And I think it's extremely encouraging for more
and more young people to have interest in financial services and financial markets. So we want to take
advantage of that with them and bring them along in a very thoughtful, smart way, as Julie outlined.

So it's not only micro products that we have, we're working on retails, we're looking at new and innovative
ways to continue to move forward with this growing constituency of clients. So very excited by the growth
of that but at the same time, I don't want you to think that we're just -- putting all of our -- everything
into one basket, such as retail because we're not -- I mean, the institutional clients of this company are
critically important. The commercials are critically important. So all the different parts that go into making
a trade work are very important as we continue to move forward and grow this business. But -- and we do
not want to deny the access to the retail participant in a good, thoughtful, smart way. And I would like to
talk a little bit about a couple of some of the fee changes associated with some of these micro products.
And maybe I can ask John to do that.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Terry. Yes. As we -- as everybody here knows, the micros have been a tremendous success, not
just in equities but also in metals as well. When you take a look at the equity micros, you've seen our
RPC steadily increase over time. It was at $0.114 per round turn in Q4 of 2019, and it hit approximately
2 million contracts a day in Q4 of 2020. And the RBC increased to $0.14. This year, we're taking a very
targeted approach to pricing, and we're really -- we're focused on changes to the nonmember fees in our
micro products with increases in micro equities of $0.05 per side, micro gold of $0.20 per side and micro
silver of $0.40 per side, and those are for nonmember fees. So I think we're continuing to add value in
that product, whether it's increasing liquidity, working with our intermediary partners through education
and also launching new products with the options on our equity products for the micros. So those are
some changes that we'll be rolling through beginning in February.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Before that gives you a little color, we'll wrap with that one.

Operator

We will now move on to our next question from Ari Ghosh of Crédit Suisse.

Arinash Ghosh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Just a quick one on the joint venture with IHS on post-trade. I was hoping to talk about the market
opportunity here, at least broadly, given that the deal hasn't closed. And any thoughts around the
potential size and growth of this business, just given the scale benefits that you'll enjoy in this fragmented
market? And then any color on the joint customer base, the level of client overlap versus perhaps more of
the complementary portion of that, that might be additive to your overall client profile. So any high-level
comments would be great.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Go ahead, John.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Ari, thank you for the question. We're extremely excited about the joint venture with IHS Markit for
the customers and our shareholders. It will be a leader in the trade processing and post-trade services
and will benefit customers by providing more efficient access to services, and we think it will be a great
platform to launch new solutions across a broad set of asset classes, including interest rates, FX, equity
and credit. This will allow us to innovate and bring to market analytics, workflow tools and solutions that
allow clients to manage their risk and process more efficiently. So when you look at the client base, there
is a substantial overlap in terms of the large global banks, utilizing the services both of market serve
and our optimization businesses, but they're all across complementary asset classes. So the strengths of
markets serve are very complementary to the strengths of our optimization businesses.

So what does that mean for clients? That means a much more efficient way for them to access those
services because a lot of the information going to those platforms are very similar and by providing one
kind of point-of-access for that information, will provide a lot of efficiencies for the clients and also reduce
the amount of errors that could potentially occur as processes could potentially break down as you're
accessing multiple platforms across multiple businesses. So very, very excited about that. So like I said,
the added value, I think, that we're going to be able to provide, which I think will be very compelling for
the clients is around additional analytics, additional workflow tools and additional solutions that we're
going to be able to offer clients because we're going to be in a place where we're going to be able to
provide our clients a window into a lot of their trade processing and post-trade services across all those
asset classes.

So we think it's going to be pretty exciting. Just a couple of quick points on it. It is -- it's going to be a
50-50 joint venture so we will be using the equity method of accounting, and it will not be consolidated
at CME Group. So it will be -- so you'll see a shift in the geography of our income statement, the revenue
and expenses will be netted in the equity and unconsolidated subsidiary line of our income statement,
similar to our indexing joint venture with S&P Global. And as I mentioned, we don't anticipate any material
changes to our earnings. One other point, just from a financial perspective is between now and close, we'll
be categorizing the optimization businesses as a held-for-sale asset in our 2021 financial statements. So
this will mainly impact balance sheet presentation, and there will be minimal impact on our pro forma
operating results. So some change in geography, but most importantly, a very positive change for the
business. And I think a real positive for our clients.

BofA Securities, Research Division

Just speaking to some of the pressure that you guys saw in short raise in WTI futures, yet an improving
economic and inflation outlook for at least the back half of this year and then '22. Just curious if you've
seen any signs of the increased traction in some of these areas, either from conversations with clients,
more participants or nuances in some of the trading activity that you're seeing?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Derek, do you want to take that?

Derek Sammann
Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Yes. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the question. Yes, we've seen a lot of action, actually, just in the last 6
weeks. If you look at the run-up of the activity over the last 6 weeks, you've seen crude recover. You've
seen WTI and Brent actually move up and lock that. There are a number of fundamental drivers as to
what's going on. The market is generally responding to the increased expectation for economic activity
with the vaccines rolling out. You've got significant reduced stocks in Cushing. If you actually look at the
drop in barrels, we've seen about a 14% reduction in the existing stock in Cushing.

This reduction is about 14%. When you look at the -- what's actually driving the uncertainty around U.S.
energy policy and the Biden administration and the increased flow of exports in the U.S., they're actually
seeing the energy curve in WTI right now in what's called backwardation, where the front end of the curve
is more expensive than the back end of the curve. And why is that important? That's hugely important
because that actually feeds into the narrative that we're seeing more broadly play out in both metals and
particularly in ags, with an overall price rising cycle. What that means is you've got folks piling in on the
increase and expectations for growth in pricing, what impact has that had in the business? We actually
sell one of our biggest days in WTI, yesterday. We traded about $1.3 million contracts. If you look at
our February ADV, it's about $1.1 million. That's up from $784,000 in Q4 of last year. The reason that's
important is that, that's actually driven us back to open interest levels, that we haven't seen for over 2.5
years. We're about 2.45 million contracts open interest versus where Brent is at about -- right about 2.6
million.

So as you've heard us talk about, Mike, as increasing economic activity takes place, that's representing
itself in the form of use of our crew benchmark globally. OI on the rise. Institutional investments flowing
in and there's broader talk of the overall commodity cycle resuming. You've got soybeans at $13.5. You've
got corn at $5, and you've got oil at highs in over 1.5 years now. So if the market is paying for economic
recovery, you're seeing that reflecting both -- just below record levels of WTI, OI and record amounts of
ag and metals product going through the franchise as well. So I think that's -- this is the place people
are playing that global reflation trade, and that's where you're looking at roll yields in WTI at 8%. So
institutional investors are looking for yield. This is the place to get it in this market right now.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

And just to continue on with that a little bit, Mike. Let me ask Sean to talk just a little bit about some of
the rate products and the SOFR and the ultra.

Maybe you can talk about the back end of the Eurodollars, especially Sean.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes. Thanks very much, Terry. Greatly appreciate it. So there's no question we're seeing a much better
market environment in the last couple of months across the rates businesses, a very exciting development

and one that we've expected. And we are especially seeing that further out the curve. Some examples in
terms of the market itself. If you look at the 2-year versus 30-year spread, that has widened out to 1.81%
or 181 basis points. We haven't seen an environment like that since February of 2017. So the market is
expecting very strong growth, and that's a very good indicator of strong growth on a go-forward basis.
Also, just very briefly, in terms of the treasury inflation protected securities or TIPS. If you look at the
10-year TIPS, they're now implying an inflation rate, a consumer inflation rate over the next decade of
2.21%. That's the highest level we've seen in implied inflation since 2014, which is at the 5-year TIPS, it's
even more impressive at 2.31% implied by the market for inflation over the next 5 years. We haven't seen
anything like that since 2013.

How is that impacting our markets? It's been a very big positive impact, especially on the long end. We've
seen several new records this year in terms of open interest in terms of our ultra 10-year futures, in
particular. We've also seen very good growth overall in the long end of the treasury curve. So if you look
through January, the ultra 10-year ADV was up 44% year-over-year. The bond future is up 13%, the ultra
bonds, up 7%. And if you look further out the curve, if you look at -- in particular, I guess, if you look at
the back 32, the back 32 contracts in our Eurodollar futures. We've seen significant growth there in the
fourth quarter, which was a very positive results. And further, I guess, I looked in detail at the greens and
the blues. So what are the greens? The Greens are the 2023 Eurodollar futures and the blues are the 2024
Eurodollar futures. So 2023, Eurodollar futures are running at an ADV up of more than 100%, this year
versus total year last year, and the blue Eurodollar features likewise, up more than 100% this year versus
last year.

The last thing I'll mention maybe on the market side that's directly impacting us. If you go back to the
third quarter of last year, the first implied tightening by the marketplace was in December of 2024. If
you look at today's marketplace, they're implying a tightening in the summer of 2023. So you see the
much-improved market outlook, the impact on market pricing and significant impact on our volumes.
Actually, I will mention, I apologize, one last thing, large open interest holders have also seen a very nice
balance. Actually, since December 1, our rates -- large open interest holders has increased by 9% and
has recovered half of the losses basically that we saw during the recent crisis, rolling 9% below the all-
time highs in our rates -- large open interest holders. The first time we reached that peak where we are --
sorry, last time we reached for the first time, I should say, we reached the current levels of LOIH rates was
2018. So we're seeing a big recovery there as well. Sorry, Terry.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

No, that's very helpful, Sean. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. Hopefully, that answered your
question.

We will now move on to our next question from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Just one clarification for me. I know you guys provided incremental color around capture rates for E-minis
and gold and on the micro side. I guess, John, if you think about the current mix staying the same, I know
you guys changed pricing on just the nonmember side, but assuming the mix of volume stays roughly the
same. Can you give us a sense of what kind of pro forma capture rates for those buckets would look like in
'21 kind of pro forma for the changes in pricing?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, sure. I think when you're talking about the mix of micros and minis, is that what you're asking, Alex?

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Right. Right, exactly. So look, I know you guys are each pricing on just the nonmember side of the
equation for both, I guess, gold and gold micros and E-mini micros. So I'm just trying to get a sense of
like what the run rate cap rates there would be for kind of assuming similar mix of volumes?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Got it. Yes. Okay. A couple of points. So one of the things that we've been doing over time is making
adjustments in the -- in some of the incentive plans for micros. And also, as I just outlined, we made
some fee adjustments so a couple of things to think about. Number one, the micros have been hugely
successful. And I think when you look at the changes that we're making, I think from an overall company
perspective, they're relatively modest. But when you look at the micros, I think there you'll see a more
meaningful impact in terms of the revenue. And we don't think this is going to be impacting volume
necessarily. We're providing a lot of value for the clients in a product that's highly liquid so we think -- so
we think it will be, from a volume perspective, not as impactful.

When you look at the capture rate, generally speaking, it's roughly an 80-20 rule. 80% of the volume
coming from members, I'm sorry, and then 20% coming from nonmembers. So when you think about
the capture rate that's something to think about. So about 20% of the volume roughly will be impacted
by the fee increase on the equity side. In metals, it's a little bit different. It's a little bit heavier on the
nonmember side. It's a little bit higher than the 80-20 in terms of the nonmembers.

Operator

We will now take our next question from Owen Lau of Oppenheimer.

Kwun Sum Lau
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

So CME just launched the Ether futures and the volume of the Bitcoin contracts has been quite strong.
Could you please talk about the regulatory environment for digital assets? And how it will impact CME to
launch more products in this space? And then also one more point, what's your plan to launch something
like E-mini or micro E-mini Bitcoin futures for retail investors?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Owen. Yes, we have seen some upticks in our Bitcoin futures contract. Obviously, we're seeing a
massive appreciation in the price. I think as of this morning it's around $46,000 a coin. So we're seeing
great appreciation in that. And of course, interest always follows those type of price movements. Let me
ask Sean to talk a little bit not only about crypto, but I think you also referenced E-minis in your question
as well. So Sean?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes. So in terms of the new crypto contracts, in terms of the Ether futures on the first day, we traded 388
contracts, 55 unique accounts across 15 FCMs and about 40% of that was customer paper. So a good start
to date. In terms of the Bitcoin doing more than 11,000 contracts a day. We are the largest risk transfer
platform for Bitcoin in the marketplace. And we've got a significant RPC in around $4 a contract. So both
growing very nicely. We do have several thousand Tag 50s that are trading at Bitcoin futures. So this also
brings additional participants to our overall markets. I don't know if that answers the question.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

And Owen, did you have a question about E-minis or no?

Kwun Sum Lau
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

13

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Yes, exactly like any plan to launch E-mini or micro E-mini Bitcoin futures for retail?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thank you. So the question was on the micro, potential micro E-mini on the Bitcoin contract. So
I think it's -- right now, without saying yes or no, we've seen a great appreciation, as I've said, in the
product of itself, the price. But at the same time, the volume is still being nurtured. It's still growing. We
want to be cautious about how many people are participating in this new asset class or historic products.
So I still start value. We need to make sure that we're comfortable going forward. We've always said we're
going to walk before we run when it comes to cryptos, I think, with the launch of our new Ether contract
and people having the ability to trade one against another. We want to see how that starts to pan out for
the parent trading or spread trading or other terms. And I think that's important before we decide we're
going to move forward with a smaller version of a crypto contract.

So again, I think this contract is not that old. It's relatively new. The options were just listed on it, I
believe, in the last several months. I'm a big believer, do you have to get a liquid options market along
with your futures contracts, so you can continue to bring it to a broader audience? And that broader
audience might be with the people that we referenced in the earlier part of this call, which is more on the
retail side. And they will obviously not -- it's hard for them to participate in such a high-value contract.
So smaller versions are something. Obviously, we're looking at it, but we have no plans to make any
announcements on the launch of something of that nature just at this point.

Operator

We'll move on to our next question from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.

Christopher Meo Harris
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Great. So another one related to the growth that's happening from retail investors. What do you guys
think about the potential risk of increased regulatory scrutiny, the larger this business becomes and
related to that, are there safeguards in place that prevent novice retail investors from trading in futures?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Well, as far as the regulatory scrutiny, we don't need retail traders to get regulatory scrutiny. You get
that with all different participants. And that is one thing that I've said forever, which is a benefit to this
organization, that we are a highly regulated entity, and I believe regulation lends the credibility of any
business and allows us to grow globally, and that's exactly what we've been able to do because of good
smart regulation. Now the question might be that do we invite different types of regulation because of
the retail client entering into the marketplace? I don't believe so only because we've got a growth of retail
over the years regardless. And I think when people have access to marketplaces, it's not like the SEC,
where the SEC's main mission is to protect the public from manipulation and fraud and other things.

We have a global regulator that obviously is looking into those things as well. But I am very convinced
that the retail participants will continue to grow, and it doesn't mean you have to have additional burdens
from regulation against them or against the entity that wants to house them as long as your practices
are in good housekeeping for lack of a better term from your margin requirements to the money that you
have on deposit for -- at your FCM. So the whole host of things that the smaller clients need to make sure
that they have to understand that they still need to have those requirements. I'll ask Julie to make some
comments on the retail globally and other places as well. Julie, do you want to comment a little bit about
that? But I think on the regulation side, Chris, I don't believe, because the growth of these particular
group of people that would invite new regulation. I think what you're seeing right now is a lot of headline
regulation being discussed, it doesn't mean it's going to happen.

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Thank you, Terry. I think he makes a very good point about the differences in the market structure, right,
between equity markets and futures. The other thing I'd just add is that this is a critical part of what our
broker partners and intermediaries really do to ensure that the retail and active traders that are going to
be trading futures are qualified to do so. And so we work with our partners throughout the globe to ensure
that. So just because you're able to trade in the equity market that's not the same as having a futures
account. And so there has to be an intentional opening of that account. Those restrictions are different
varying on countries. But what we see is that typically, right, there's a graduation of retail and active
traders from trading the equity markets into trading equity options and then coming into the derivatives
marketplace.

And so that lends itself to be a more sophisticated retail trader. And that's part of what we work with our
broker partners on the education front as well. So they are well versed in what they're getting into and
opening up accounts because they're ready to trade in our markets because we want to make sure they
are well supported and that we have a good customer experience for them and a diverse set of products
for them to access.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

And so Chris, what I've heard a lot of, and I'm sure you have as well, is some headlines and a whole
host of people making different rhetoric as it relates to the recent activity by what's mostly some of
the retail traders have done. So that you have people talking about transaction taxes. You have people
talking about wealth taxes. You have people talking about high frequency trading. You have people talking
about payment for order flow. Just so that we're all clear. What happened in the marketplace last week
could have happened without any of those things being in place at all. So it had nothing to do with it, but
people are seeming to pick their favorite regulation de jure or tax de jure to add to what's going on in the
marketplace over the last several weeks as it relates to some of this retail activity, of which it has nothing
to do with it.

So I'm hopeful that we always have the ability to go voice our opinions as it relates to some of the
potential regulatory conversations. There'll be a hearing coming up, I believe, this week or next. And then
we will always participate in these to make sure that our voice is heard but again, I think what you're
hearing right now is mostly headlines from a bunch of pundits about what they believe happen and how
they believe they could have stopped it or not had it happened at all.

Next, we'll take the question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.

Kenneth Brooks Worthington
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

I'd love to dig a bit deeper into the FX business in advance of the further integration with EBS. Your FX
futures volume and OI growth has been maybe more stagnant over the last 6 years, despite being a global
product at a time when you've been very successful in building up this global client base. So what's been
weighing on sort of CME FX future trading and OI growth over the -- maybe the intermediate term as well
as more recently in zero rates. And then, I guess, maybe more importantly, with the integration of NEX
upcoming for FX, how do things change for the FX futures business? And how does the combination sort of
jump-start futures for CMA?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Sean, do you want to take that?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Sure. Thanks very much for the question. Greatly appreciate it. We're very excited actually about the
developments and the success we've had recently in our FX futures marketplace. We have, over the last

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.

15

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

few years, been continuously reducing the minimum price increments. We've done it across 9 different
instruments. Very excited actually. Late last year, we saw an all-time record open interest in our Euro
versus USD futures, which is really main thing, given the fact that volatility has been -- has had a
tremendous dampening effect on volumes. If you look at last year across each of the major currency pairs,
the volatility ranking was typically the lowest decile going back the last 20 years. So in other words, 90%
of the time over the last 20 years, volatility was higher in each of the major currency pairs.

Nonetheless, even in that environment we saw a record number of record open interest in those Euro
versus USD contracts. In addition to that, the changes we've been making in order to make our complex
much more attractive. We've also seen recently good growth in block trading. So in the month of
December, we saw our largest-ever U.S. dollar versus sterling options block trade, and that was the
equivalent of $2 billion in a single trade. So market participants are migrating more of their options
activity towards the listed space. That actually could accelerate through this year, why? Something we
haven't spoken about in a while because it was delayed last year relative to COVID. But we do expect
there'll be 100 new participants, at least 100 new participants that are required this year globally to
adhere to the uncleared margin rules back in September of this year. That should drive more products
requiring greater efficiencies, and in particular, could positively impact our FX options.

In the month of January after we saw the record block size in December in dollar versus sterling, we
saw a record block size in Aussie dollars, that was AUD 4 billion. So we have seen our efforts, futures
last year actually outperformed the spot marketplaces. And we're seeing now some uptick in the option
space, particularly in block. In terms of what the team is doing in order to make the -- our platform much
more attractive and to take the unique set of assets we have, right? So we now have the EBS as well as
the futures data. So we are looking to use this unique set of assets in order to bring greater analytics,
greater tools to the marketplace to cross-sell our products down, and particularly cross-sell the futures
down the EBS distribution channel and to show participants the value of using both marketplaces. We have
the analytics now that we've recently launched that show market participants that you really need to use
both the futures as well as the spot liquidity pools in order to optimize your execution and reduce your
execution cost.

Some of the new tools that we've launched. So we launched the new FX Swap Rate Monitor. We did that
now late summer of last year. More than 4,000 views, more than 3,000 users. This is using our FX Link
product. It's the first time ever. There's a central limit order book, a standardized, clear lower total cost
alternatives, FX swaps available to market participants. We're seeing some greater uptake there. We are
making some enhancements to technology that will come out later this year that will make it much easier
to consume for participants, and we do expect to see significant growth once that technology is released.
In addition to that, we also released the new FX Vol Converter tool. This takes all of our listed FX options
and it converts it to OTC equivalents so that all OTC participants can see our FX options on futures the
same way they look at the OTC markets.

We think that, that's a part of what drove that record block trade in December and the record block
trade in January. Last thing I'll mention is our FX Market Profile tool. This for the first time, synchronizes
the data between EBS spot foreign exchange and our foreign exchange futures. It shows the relative
liquidity that did offer spread, the top of book, so the size available to hit or list, in each of the 2
markets simultaneously, and it quantitatively shows participants the benefits. The benefits of using both
marketplaces. So we're very excited about these new tools. We are distributing them out to the very
large tail of clients who use EBS, especially regional banks across Europe and Asia. And most exciting is,
I mentioned earlier, the excitement I have over the migration of BrokerTec over Globex and how that's
going to allow us to offer new products and services with that greater technology.

Similarly, on the EBS side, we'll be migrating EBS over the Globex later this year, which will allow us to
offer many new products and services across that platform, number one. Number two, it will also make
it much simpler once we move it over for participants to trade on EBS. So we should be able to attract
new participants. Last thing I'll mention is we've been investing in direct streaming technology. And we
do expect to roll that out likewise later this year. We expect to have the State-of-the-Art direct streaming
platform available for participants in foreign exchange later this year. Once we do that foreign exchange,
we will actually also roll that out in U.S. treasuries.

We will now move on to our next question from Simon Clinch of Atlantic Equities.

Simon Alistair Vaughan Clinch
Atlantic Equities LLP, Research Division

I was wondering if I could get an update, please, on the agreement with the DTCC regarding cross-
margining and whether that's already been submitted to the SEC. And in terms of timing of how long you
think it might take for something like that to be approved and when you might actually start to see the
real benefits of that in your fundamental numbers?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Really good question, Simon. Let me turn it over to Sunil Cutinho, the President of our Clearinghouse to
address this. Sunil?

Sunil Cutinho
President of CME Clearing

Thank you, Terry. Very quickly. I think we have -- very few participants know this, but we currently have a
cross-margining agreement with DTCC. Our effort right now is to improve that cross-margining agreement
and enhance the savings. So we are actively working with DTCC. It's very hard to handicap regulatory
approvals, so all we can say is we anticipate completing the operational effort this year. And then the rest
depends upon the approval time lines with the SEC and the CFTC.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Right. And just to add to that, Simon, we're hopeful that and Sunil has been working on this rigorously but
we talk a lot about efficiencies. And this is one of those efficiencies that we are very excited about once it
gets put into place for our global client base trading in the rating business. And you heard Sean Tully talk
earlier about some of the encouraging sign around our rates business, especially with the widening of the
yield curve a little bit and some of the things where this could be a huge benefit for us.

So we're really excited about creating more and more of these efficiencies. It's been a pretty much one of
the things that we've been focused on over the last several years is to bring client efficiencies, which we
think will bring greater growth to our businesses. And this asset class is right for that. So we're looking
forward to getting that agreement done with DTCC and the SEC. And then going forward with the growth
that Sean has already pointed out in these rates businesses that would have a big part of. So thank you
for your question, Simon.

And I know we're getting into injury time here. But Terry, maybe just a quick one on the emissions
contract. I know we've discussed carbon offsets and other green contracts in the past. Just kind of
wondering what's changed on the demand side of the equation that led you guys to launch this contract?
And can you characterize the competitive landscape and how big you think this might be over time?

this contract for us, so Derek?

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Senior MD and Global Head of Commodities & Options Products

Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. It's an exciting space. And I think what you're seeing right now, and you're
absolutely right, there is an absence of mandates globally right now there. The existing markets, again,
emissions tend to be very, very regional in nature. And why we're excited about working with CBL
exchange on this, which is our partner developing this contract, is that this represents a significant change
in that. These carbon offset futures represent a contract that is an offset versus whatever it is, in fact,
underlying product or EMIR might be involved in, not limited just to the energy markets. Imagine a farmer
that wants to manage this carbon footprint. Imagine an aluminum company that wants to adhere to either
voluntary standards or regional standards and emissions credit. So this is a product that very capably is
able to extend outside of just the traditional space in energy and have an application across a full range of
our commodities participants even noncommodities participants.

The feedback that we've gotten both in the validation stage is going out to the market and assessing an
interest in this. And actually, since we've announced has been bigger and actually more overwhelming
than we had anticipated. So to remind everybody, this is a voluntary emission offset. It's based on
standards that the market participants are agreeing to and the competitive space is one that is open
right now. When you look at the position that we're in, in our commodities markets, we are the largest
metals market. We are the largest energy market. We're the largest agricultural products market. So the
application of these offset products extend well beyond just the energy space. So we think this is going to
be a process of not just dealing with fossil fuels market in transition, you look at most company charters
right now.

Everybody is trying to adhere to ESG standards that apply to what they feel the carbon footprint needs
are. So this is broadly applicable to a lot of different market participants. The feedback we're getting
validates that. We're excited to get this out. We've got a whole host of market makers and market takers
lined up on this. So we're excited about what this could mean. And this is a slightly different product than
what you're seeing in the existing product site that we have and others have that are really regionally
focused. So we think this is early days in this. We think this is extensible out to the range of benchmark
markets that we run and where we run the majority of liquidity in. And so we think this will be a great
service to customers looking to extend their ESG credentials and manage their carbon footprint in really
new and unique and market-oriented ways.

of ours and creating value for our clients and ultimately, our shareholders by providing more efficiencies
for those clients and then using that as a platform to provide other services around that. So that's our
primary focus. I wouldn't say that we necessarily are looking specifically for a type of revenue whether it's
transactional or subscription, I would say we're more focused on optimizing the revenue and based on the
industry that asset is in.

We are very focused on completing the next -- the next integration. As we mentioned previously, we're
targeting $200 million in run rate synergies by the end of this year. We're well on track. We've exceeded
our synergies each of the last 2 years. And we're well on track to achieve that $200 million for 2021. So
that's our point of view. And with that, I'll turn it over to the next question.

Operator

We'll move on to our next question, which comes from Chris Allen of Compass Point.

Christopher John Allen
Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division

Just a real quick one for me. You talked about increases and price increases in market data and on the
micros. Have you enacted any other price increases in any other products that we should contemplate for
this year?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

John?

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks, Chris. As you recall, in 2020, we made a number of adjustments across all of our asset
classes with an expected revenue impact of 1.5% to 2% in futures and options transaction fees and I
reviewed the results of that, and we did achieve our objective. Going into this year, we're being very
targeted in our approach and you hit on all the ones that we've announced. We've announced adjustments
to our -- the member fees and the micros, and we made some selective adjustments to our market data
business in terms of increasing the screen fees for real-time data and also the nondisplay data. So those
are the ones that we've announced thus far. I would say this is a year that we'll be flexible in terms of our
approach. And a lot of it really depends on how the year plays out. So we'll always be looking at creating
value for our clients and charging appropriately for that value that we're adding.

Operator

We will take our next question from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division

What's your assessment of the competitive landscape in cash U.S. treasuries trading? Particularly in light
of the pending sale of NASDAQ fixed income to Tradeweb?

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Sean, you want to address that?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes. So no question we embrace competition, and we're continuously looking to make our platform and
our services far more attractive to participants. As I mentioned earlier, we're very excited about moving
the BrokerTec over to the Globex platform. That improved technology will allow us to create much more
attractive products and services like RV technology. The implied that we have on RV are unmatched by any

other technology in the marketplace. And so we are very excited about that as a unique value proposition.
In addition to that, we've got a unique data set that nobody else in the world has, which is that the ability
to synchronize our treasury futures data along our cash treasury data. So in addition to the $100 billion
plus of cash treasuries that we trade on BrokerTec every day. Recall, we do $400 billion-ish a day in our
treasury futures. So we got unique data sets with unique efficiencies that provide market participants and
unique analytics in order to improve their execution.

In addition to that, we are investing in, as I mentioned earlier, BrokerTec stream, so direct streaming
of U.S. treasuries and on the benefit of having both the streamed platform as well as central limit order
book. So we have the strongest dealer-to-dealer central limit order book in the world. We are building our
direct streaming business, dealer to dealer. And we're combining that with the unique data that we have
in futures to provide a unique set of analytics and efficiencies that nobody else can offer. So we embrace
competition. And as I said earlier, I'm constantly focused on making sure that we have the single most
attractive place, the single most attractive platform for any participant in order to execute their risk. I
hope that helps.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Sean. Thank you, Patrick.

Operator

We'll move on to our next question from Alex Kramm of UBS.

Alexander Kramm
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. And I apologize if that's been mentioned before. One, on the other
revenue, John, did you mention what drove the strength this quarter? And how do I think about the
sustainability of that line item or what seasonally may change here, I guess, over the next few quarters?
And then just as a quick follow-up to the question just now on the treasury business. I don't know if
you've talked about this in the past, but I think it was in the prepared deck again, the dealer-to-client
repo offering that you have, I guess, within Brokertec now or NEX now. Have you talked about this before?
Why are you doing this? And also, does that mean that you're maybe willing to play a little bit more in the
D2C space? I think historically, it's been really dealer to dealer. So any quick comments there would be
appreciated.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Let me ask John to comment first, and then I'll turn it to Sean. Before Sean makes a comment, let
me reference something about the dealer to client and then dealer to dealer the way our structure is in
Brokertec.

John C. Peschier
Managing Director of Investor Relations

Yes. Thanks. No, no, we didn't -- we hadn't covered the other revenue yet, Alex. So when you take a look
at our other revenues, it's up about $10 million sequentially between Q3 and Q4. And there are a number
of puts and takes, but the primary driver of the increase is our annual adjustment based on exchange
activity paid by our partner in Brazil for software that we licensed them. There was also a termination fee
related to our agreement with the Korean exchange. Both these agreements conclude in the fourth quarter
of 2020. So you will not see that $10 million step-up between Q3 and Q4 going forward.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Sean, why don't you address real quickly the dealer to client, I believe, on the repo side and not so much
on the Brokertec dealer-to-dealer platform.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes. Thanks very much, Terry. So we do see -- and thanks for the question. We do see the opportunity,
and we are executing on a dealer-to-client legal platform, both for Europe and we recently launched it in
the United States. We see it as offering huge operational efficiencies to market participants, especially
between dealers and customers relative to the transactional handshake. There are also opportunities
then to leverage, obviously, the deal-to-dealer platform in combination with the dealer-to-customer
platform and repo. In dealer-to-customer space, we are seeing near all-time record European repo
volumes on our dealer-to-dealer space recently. So we are engaged in that space. We do believe that we
can add electronic operational efficiencies for that space, and we are seeing so far good uptake from our
customers.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

And again, just to reemphasize, Sean, we have not changed any -- structurally around our dealer-to-
dealer platform as it relates to the Brokertec treasuries just on the repos.

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

That's absolutely correct, Terry. Thank you for clarifying.

Operator

We'll then move on to our next question from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler.

Richard Henry Repetto
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes. And Terry, first, thanks on that sort of level-headed comments on equity market structure. We'll see
what the regulators and lawmakers followed that sort of level-headed thing about it.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

We will see.

Richard Henry Repetto
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Yes, we will see on February 18. So I guess, following that line of thinking up from a regulatory
standpoint, you mentioned or someone asked about the margin efficiencies from DTCC to the CME
clearinghouse. And I know you bring benefits from the technology side, from a data side. But wouldn't
this sort of like just top off the whole promise of trading cash and futures on the same platform, adding to
those other benefits? And like if there's an offset that, that's clearly, like what is the regulatory hang up or
process here, if there was -- if you own the cash and you have an offset from a future, why -- been a long
process, but what's making it more difficult, I guess is the question.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes. Good question, Rich. Let me ask Sunil to comment a little bit, but you are absolutely correct, one of
the great benefits of the transaction with NEX was to do the integration of BrokerTec and Globex to create
the efficiencies going forward. And we are, as you've heard other speakers talk earlier, very excited by
that integration being completed and not the EBS, to create the efficiencies. That is really what we're all
about. Let me ask Sunil to comment a little bit on the risk side and the efficiency side on the margins.

Sunil Cutinho
President of CME Clearing

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

Thank you, Terry. Rich, just to give you a simple answer. We currently have cross-margining agreement
and there are participants who are taking advantage of the offsets between cash and treasury futures.
So it is an existing program. We started this in 2003, and we continue to provide that service. What
we're doing right now is enhancing that. So we are actively working with DTCC. Now given that it is 2
clearinghouses, 2 separate clearinghouses and the fact that we are regulated by -- one is by the CFTC and
the other is by the SEC, we just have to work through the process to get any enhancements improved. So
that does take time. But we are very confident that we'll get through that process. It's just that it's very
hard for us to give you a time frame when it comes to regulatory approvals, so that's what we're saying.
So operationally, we continue to work actively in improving the margin efficiencies between our 2 clearing
firms. I hope that helps.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Yes. And again, Rich, we can't control the CEO of the SEC or the CFTC. But I will say that I think the
clients are really pressuring also because they know the efficiencies that this brings without adding any
risk to the system, which is critically important. And the regulators, hopefully are weighing that in a very
margin-intense world that we live in, where all razor-thin, especially in this world today, interest rates.
So I'm hopeful that we will get this agreement completed and start seeing the benefits go to the clients
because that's exactly what they need to do to continue to run their businesses more efficiently. And I
think the governments understand that well.

Operator

We will now move on to our final question from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Just want to clarify. I just want to follow-up to the retail question I had earlier if you're disclosing the
proportion of either revenue or ADV that's coming from retail. I think you did that a while back? And then
maybe just a question for Sean also on LIBOR for '21 in terms of how you see that developing for the
SOFR, the CME SOFR contracts versus the Eurodollar contracts, whether you think that transition is really
going to take a lot longer and therefore, that switchover to SOFR will be much more slow, much more
gradual.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

So Brian, let me ask John and/or Julie to comment on your first question. I'll make a comment around
LIBOR and take it to Sean and then we'll wrap it up.

John William Pietrowicz
Chief Financial Officer

Yes. Thanks. We don't and haven't disclosed the revenue from retail for a while. In general, when you take
a look at the retail business, we're generating in the fourth quarter, about 1 million contracts a day from
what we call the retail segment or the active trader segment. So -- and also, we made a comment today
around the proportion of member, nonmember mix and the adjustments we've made to the pricing. So
that should help in terms of modeling it out. So that is -- that question, I'll pass it over to Sean on the
follow-up question.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

And then Sean is going to write -- respond to that. Let me just make a comment. One of the things that
we have said as it relates to LIBOR and it relates to the transition over -- especially over the last 1 year or
1.5 years is that we believe we're in a very strong position to benefit from whatever is the outcome as it
relates to LIBOR. And I think what you heard from Sean earlier, and I'm sure he'll -- references himself,
but I didn't want to be remiss if I didn't say it again. When we're looking at the growth of the back 32 of

Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

22

CME GROUP INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 10, 2021

the Eurodollar contract like we're seeing today, we're looking at the growth of the SOFR futures contract,
like we're seeing today of roughly 94%, 96% of the open interest being held here at CME. We are the
beneficiaries of both products growing. And that is something we said is a strong possibility, and we're
starting to see that mature in our favor, and we're very encouraged by that.

So Sean can talk about the timing or the transition from LIBOR to SOFR and I guess, Sean, it could be
a bit speculative, but there are some hard dates that people are talking about and fallbacks associated
with it. But I would be remiss if I didn't remind folks that it is important that we have a really strong rate
franchise with efficiencies that are almost unmatched anywhere in the world, and we are very excited that
we can participate both in SOFR and in Eurodollars. Sean?

Sean P. Tully
Senior MD and Global Head of Financial & OTC Products

Yes. So thanks so much, Terry, for that, and thanks for the question. There are several points in there.
So again, if you at the back 32 between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter 2020, ADV
grew. So it's in the Eurodollar futures, they grew by 36%. So a very positive result. As I said earlier, we've
seen very good growth in January in the greens and the blues of the 2023 and 2024 contracts. So for
that curve, Eurodollar futures growing very strongly. At the same time, we've recently seen a number of
records in our SOFR futures. 2020 was a record year for volume, SOFR futures of 51,000 contracts. And
so far this year, we're doing more than 100,000 contracts a day. In January, we also saw an open interest
record of 727,000 SOFR futures contracts.

We also saw a record number of large open interest holders in our SOFR futures of 175 large open interest
holders. And we have more than 500 participants trading in the SOFR futures. Last thing I'll mention
maybe in terms of SOFR is that if you look at the global SOFR marketplace in terms of futures, we have
about 80% of the average daily volume so far this year, and we are running 92%, 93% of the global open
interest. So we see recently, good growth in the back end of the Eurodollar futures, also extremely good
growth in our SOFR features. They absolutely had somewhat different takes on the interest rate market
and both very useful from a participant standpoint. We have seen from IBA and the FCA. They recently did
launch a survey, I guess, of where they are potentially looking at whether or not LIBOR should continue to
be published post-June of 2023. So that's a long time away. There's a lot of uncertainty.

In the meantime, our SOFR futures are growing strongly. The back end of the Eurodollar futures are
growing strongly. And I think we're exactly where we wanted to be. As Terry mentioned, in terms of
efficiencies, with the huge open interest in the Eurodollar futures, the bulk of the open interest in SOFR
futures. Obviously, from an execution clearing standpoint, both, right? The big commodity spreads on the
execution side as well as then margin offsets between the 2 futures contracts, no one else can compete
with those sets of efficiencies. In addition to that, we've got SOFR interest rate swaps as well as obviously
all of our LIBOR-based interest rate swaps. And the potential for portfolio margining offsets then between
all of those futures and all those swaps left. In terms of the portfolio margin, I think I talked about this
on the last earnings call, but we did offer starting December of last year. Portfolio margining between
Eurodollar options and interest rate swaps.

We've got more than a handful of participants taking advantage of that and already getting well over $100
million a day worth of margin efficiency. So we continue to enhance the efficiencies. Last thing -- I will
mention one last thing. Don't forget, we have the single largest U.S. treasury repo platform on the planet.
That is where SOFR is created every day to a large extent. So we also are providing that -- the actual
transactions that go to making up SOFR every day in addition to our SOFR futures and SOFR swaps, and I
will end there.

Terrence A. Duffy
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Sean. Thanks, Brian. Hopefully that gave you little color.
