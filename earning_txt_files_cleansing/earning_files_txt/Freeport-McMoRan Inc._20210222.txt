FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoran First Quarter
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Financial Officer.
Please go ahead, ma'am.

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoran conference call. We
released our results this morning, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our
website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to
the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In
addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a
replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.

Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our
comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Like to
refer every one to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to
the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K.

On the call with me today is Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO. We've got Mark Johnson, who
leads our Indonesian operations; Josh Olmsted, who leads our Americas operations; Mike Kendrick, who
leads our molybdenum business; Steve Higgins, who leads our commercial activities and is our Chief
Administrative Officer as well; and Rick Coleman, who leads our project development activities. And I'll
just start with briefly summarizing our financial results. We'll work through our slides and some prepared
remarks, and then we will take your questions.

Today, we reported first quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $718 million, that
was $0.48 per share. And adjusted net income of $756 million or $0.51 per share after adjusting for net
charges totaling $38 million or $0.03 per share, and a detail of those net nonrecurring charges are in the
press release on Roman numeral VI. We reported adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation
and amortization or adjusted EBITDA during the quarter of $2.04 billion, and we've got a reconciliation of
our EBITDA calculations on Page 36 of our slide deck.

In the first quarter of 2021, we had copper sales of 825 million pounds, which approximated our estimate.
Our gold production in the first quarter of 2021 was in line with our estimate in January. However, we had
a deferral of certain shipments in Indonesia to the second quarter, and that resulted in a timing variance
for our gold sales. In the first quarter, we benefited from improved pricing. Our first quarter average
realized copper price was $3.94 per pound, substantially above the year ago quarter. And our gold price of
$17.13 per ounce was also above the year ago realized price.

We continue to focus on maintaining a low-cost position. Our consolidated average unit net costs for our
copper mines average $1.39 per pound of copper in the first quarter. We generated strong operating cash
flows totaling $1.1 billion, and that was net of $300 million of working capital uses. And the cash flow has
exceeded capital spending, which totaled $370 million during the quarter. As you've seen, our Board, in
February, adopted a new financial policy aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining the strong
balance sheet, increasing cash returns to shareholders and advancing opportunities for future growth. We
ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $4.6 billion of consolidated cash, $9.8 billion of debt
and our net debt -- our debt, net of cash, was $5.2 billion at the end of March.

Richard, I'd like to turn the call over to you, and we'll start reviewing the slide materials that are on our
website.

FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Kathleen. I couldn't be more pleased to be able to review with you our first quarter performance
and particularly the exciting progress we've achieved over the past year where we all faced such
uncertainties. It's a special, active invigorating time here at Freeport. Our teams are working safely.
We remain vigilant with COVID as we have successfully executed our operations' plans, and we're now
working on projects for future growth.

Our Grasberg underground ramp up is proceeding on schedule, that's key for our strategy. Production
in the United States is increasing with our newly commissioned Lone Star mine, the first quarter start
-- restart of our Chino mine in New Mexico, and from increased mine rates where we -- at Morenci, our
flagship mine in the U.S., the largest in North America, where we could curtail production a year ago to
conserve cash.

In South America, we're working to restore production levels to prepandemic levels, and we'll achieve
that over the next 12 months. The Cerro Verde team in Peru and our El Abra team in Chile are doing an
outstanding work in navigating these issues. We are focusing on sustainability initiatives as all businesses
are. This has always been key to Freeport in managing our operations. We are moving to certify each of
our operations with the new Copper Mark. This Copper Mark is an industry framework that was recently
developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN
Sustainable Development Goals. To date, we lead the industry with 6 of our operations now certified, and
we're working to get all certified.

Going to the slides, I have just a few slides to review with you. On Slide 3, our annual sustainability
report has been published and is now available on our website. This is the 20th year we've reported on
sustainability. We're working to make it better. I encourage all of you -- each of you to read it. We are
proud of our good work on sustainability and remain committed to continuous improvement. Past years,
we released this report with our annual shareholders at our Annual Shareholders' meeting. We moved it
up. We've added new resources to our Freeport team working on sustainability issues. And I congratulate
this team for their efforts to make this report available now earlier so that we can facilitate our expanding
engagements with a broad set of constituencies that are now focused on our sustainability performance
and initiatives.

Last year, we published our initial report on climate. Our 2021 report is forthcoming. We recently
published our annual report to shareholders with what I think is a great theme, charging ahead,
responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. This theme portrays where we are currently positioned at Freeport.
As a leading and growing global copper producer, we are determined to succeed and operate responsibly,
and the Freeport tradition will be relentless in the execution of our strategy.

Slide 4. Our first quarter production was in line with our targets. We increased our 2021 sales guidance
3.85 billion pounds of copper and our 2022 volumes to 4.4 billion pounds. The Grasberg ramp up that
I referenced earlier continues to progress in a simply outstanding fashion. We've now achieved 75% of
our annualized targeted long-run metal production run rate. We are on track to be at 90% by the third
quarter and full rates by year-end. After all these years of hard work, reporting this progress is simply a
highlight of my career. The credit, though, goes to our team on the ground in Indonesia, supported by our
global team of technical experts. This is a historical major accomplishment as we've converted -- as we
are finalizing the conversion of the Grasberg open pit to this massive underground operations.

Americas businesses are going well. We are achieving production and cost targets. And now we're
actively focusing and working on future growth opportunities, generating strong cash flows, improving
our balance sheet. Over the past 12 months, net debt was reduced by over $3 billion to $5.2 billion by
the end of this first quarter. But during this period, copper price averaged $3.13. It's now over $4.25.
Many are predicting higher prices near term. Our near-term outlook of copper and gold sales volumes is
substantially higher. Our recent performance, this large reduction in debt with lower commodity prices,
lower production volumes, demonstrates the current strength of our company in generating cash flows.
Our strong performance and the positive outlook for our business and the commodities has enabled our

FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Board to adopt a new financial policy, which will provide increasing cash returns to shareholders while
providing flexibility for growth and building a very strong balance sheet.

We've also added 2 new directors: David Abney, the retired Chairman and CEO of UPS, with its massive
global supply chain operations; and Bob Dudley, the retired CEO of BP, a long-time leader in the global
extractive industry, have joined our Board. Each of these men have strong knowledge and experience in
global markets and with issues we face in managing our business. Bob and David had many opportunities
to join other Board. Their decisions to join our Board is personally gratifying and appreciated. They are
really enthusiastic about working with their fellow directors at Freeport and our management team and
creating value responsibly for our stakeholders.

Moving to Slide 5. Countries around the world are responding to COVID with aggressive fiscal and
monetary policies. This is an important element of near-term demand for copper, extending beyond
China. China has been the driver of copper demand growth over the past 2 decades. Now the source of
new demand is expanding. In addition to continuing strong copper consumption in China, higher copper
consumption in developed countries with COVID recovery initiatives and the increasingly important
demand in emerging markets driven by global growth, copper now has major new sources of demand from
global investments in carbon reduction, infrastructure and expanded technology, 5G, artificial intelligence
and data analytics broadly all require more copper. Importantly, copper is essential to the transition to
a global cleaner energy future. Roughly 70% of copper is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy
initiatives are implemented, copper intensity in the economy expands in a major way. The outlook for
copper has never been better.

Slide 6. Significant demand growth is inevitable. Supply to meet this growth is severely challenged.
It's going to require meaningfully higher prices to support mine investment. The combination of rising
demand, scarcity of new supplies point to large impending structural deficits, supporting much higher
copper prices than previously anticipated. I'm sure you've noted this in recent forecast by mining group
of industry analysts. Freeport is notably well positioned to benefit from these fundamentals, a leading
responsible large-scale producer of copper with near-term and longer-term growth embedded in our
portfolio. The scarcity value of a portfolio, like ours, is unique. It's extremely valuable now and it's going
to be even more valuable as large market deficits emerge.

Slide 7 highlights our near-term growth. For 2021, copper volumes are anticipated to be 20% higher and
gold volumes 50% higher than in 2020 -- 55% higher than in 2020. Volumes are expected to grow further
in 2020 in the 15% to 20% range for both copper and gold. The capital to achieve these near-term higher
volumes and the execution risks are largely behind us. Higher volumes with low incremental costs will
yield expanded margins. At prices ranging from $4 to $5 for copper, we would generate annual EBITDA for
2022 and 2023 of over $12 billion to the range of $17 billion per annum. That's big numbers.

Page 8 describes this new financial policy adopted -- our Board adopted earlier this year. It's designed
first to support a strong balance sheet, increased returns to shareholders and provide funds for our
investments for the future. The current market for copper and its favorable outlook are providing
substantial cash flows to meet these objectives as I just outlined. Our Board approved a base dividend
of $0.30 per annum per share. Our first quarterly dividend will be paid in May after -- as we resume
dividends, after reaching a target net debt in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, which at today's prices will
do by the end of this year. Our Board's policy establishes as a performance-based payout framework for
additional cash return to shareholders through dividends and potentially stock buybacks.

Returns to shareholders will be determined by allocating available cash flow of up to 50% to shareholder
returns and the balance available for future growth and potentially further debt reduction below our
targeted $3 billion to $4 billion. Our Board will assess the additional payout, at least, annually. With the
current level of copper prices and the outlook for copper and gold prices, the numbers noted above point
to a large cash returns to shareholders with substantial financial resources available for future growth
investments.

Slide 9 describes some of these growth investments. We have multiple options across our portfolio. We
resumed our work that we suspended a year ago because of COVID to evaluate in the timing and the

FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

initiation of these opportunities. In the U.S., we're looking at expansions at Lone Star and Bagdad and also
evaluating opportunities to increase production from leach recovery technologies. That's really exciting.

The Lone Star mine is our newest mine. It's adjacent to our existing operations in Southeast Arizona
where the company's operations go back to the 1800s. There, we have strong community support. We
have great relationships with the Native American groups. We're evaluating expansions of Lone Star's
oxides ore, which we're now producing and which are growing in terms of the availability of ores. But
importantly, we're also conducting these longer-range planning for the development in what looks to be a
potentially world-class sulfide resource right in the midst of this historical mining area.

At Bagdad, in Northwest Arizona, we have an opportunity to construct a new concentrator to double
production. We have a very long reserve life there. Also, there, we have strong community support. I keep
emphasizing this because that's a challenge for new supply development around the world.

We are focused on technology to reduce capital intensity in these projects. Leach technology initiatives
provide substantial opportunities in this regard to add value all across the portfolio. We're continuing to
evaluate an attractive, potentially significant expansion of our El Abra mine in Chile where we're partnered
with CODELCO. This project would require larger investment and longer lead times than our U.S. project.
Resource is attractive and very large. This signifies that a major future expansion of El Abra is likely.

We're evaluating the development of a new deposit, an undeveloped deposit, at PT-FI in Papua, Indonesia.
It's called Kucing Liar. This copper-gold project involves a large block cave mine using the substantial
infrastructure already in place for Grasberg. It would benefit from our expertise and long track record of
success in block caving.

We're also -- and this is a lot of fun in evaluating a series of interesting investments in projects that
support our carbon reduction and other sustainability goals. This involves ideas of developing new energy
generation. It's clean, renewable for our operations and nearby communities. And we're advancing
plans for an exciting projects at Atlantic Copper and Spain to recover valuable metals through recycling
electronic devices, which, again, is good from a sustainability standpoint.

Now we have these opportunities. We're going to be disciplined by making new investments, by being
selective and measured in deploying capital, focused on value-added investments and do this because we
have such long live reserves, established license to operate and we're going to work with communities
effective by new investments.

Slide 10 points to this reserve position. Our reserve life is over 30 years. Now that's proved and probable
economically recoverable reserves. In addition, we have identified over 100 billion pounds of copper
from metal resources beyond reserves, all part of our existing operations. We're going to be working
to incorporate these into future reserve additions and mine plants. It is becoming increasingly more
challenging and costly for our industry to develop supplies to meet the dramatically increasing demand for
copper. And our team literally loves where our Freeport is situated in this environment.

Slide 11. We have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia. In all of these
localities, we've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets,
and most importantly, our workers' communities in the countries where we operate. We have significant
development in large-scale operating expertise -- development and large-scale operating expertise. We
have all the capabilities now to undertake new projects anywhere in the world, regardless of the ore or the
situation in a responsible and efficient manner.

I want to close by recognizing the people of Freeport around the globe. Their commitment, dedication
are remarkable achievements over the past year of COVID is really special. In the context of all the
challenges our team has faced over the years and we have overcome, I'm just immensely proud of this
team. Building on these accomplishments with an increasingly bright future, Freeport is charging ahead
responsibly, reliably and relentlessly.

Kathleen is going to review the financial results with you.

President & CFO

Thank you, Richard, and I'll just make some brief comments on our financial and operating matters, and
then we can take your questions.

Starting on Slide 14, we provide some additional details on our operating activities. You can see, in the
U.S., the Lone Star mine is operating well. We see opportunities to continue to increase our stacking rates
there and fill up the tank house, which has a capacity in the 285 million pound per annum range. With
continued success in increasing the mining and stacking rates, we'll have an opportunity for relatively low
incremental investments, increased production from the Lone Star oxides well above the original design.

We restarted Chino in the first quarter at a 50% rate. And as we gain the efficiencies we are targeting
there, we'll likely have opportunities to ramp up further. At Morenci, we're increasing mining rates
by about 10%. This was previously planned for 2022, but we are accelerating this, which will give us
additional production in 2022 compared with the earlier plan and set us up for growing production over
time.

In South America, the team was able to achieve stronger rates compared with our plan. Because of the
operating restrictions in Peru, we felt it was prudent to maintain our plan this year at a milling rate of
360,000 tonnes per day, and we expect to ramp that up over the next 12 months to the 400,000 tonne
per day level as COVID restrictions are lifted.

At El Abra, we're making great progress increasing our operating rates to provide additional copper in
2022. As Richard mentioned, at Grasberg, we made excellent progress in the first quarter, continuing to
execute the ramp-up plan to achieve our targeted metal run rates by the end of the year. We ended the
first quarter with more inventory than originally expected, and these sales will be recorded in the second
quarter. You will note from our detailed schedules in the reference material that we made some small
changes in the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ mine sequencing. The net effect of these were not
material to our metal production, and the outlook is similar to the prior plans. We're very encouraged with
the scale of the ramp up going on both at Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. We'll be adding a second
crusher at Grasberg Block Cave this quarter, which will set us up to continue to increase rates there.

On the next slide, we provide an update on our plans to develop new smelter capacity in Indonesia to
meet our commitments to the government. We're proceeding with our Japanese partners at PT Smelting to
expand the existing smelter. This can be done on a relatively low-cost basis and would reduce the required
capacity for the new smelter to 1.7 million tonnes of concentrate per annum. The cost for PT Smelting is
roughly $250 million. And PT-FI would fund these costs through a bank financing, which is currently in
progress.

As you've read, we have been engaging in discussions with third-party for the balance of the requirement,
whereby this party would build the new smelter under a structure similar to what we developed for the
PT smelting existing smelter in the 1990s. To date, the parties have had extensive negotiations, but we
have not yet reached acceptable commercial terms. In the interim, we're continuing our planning on the
greenfield project in East Java.

As we show on this chart on the right, you'll see that the long-term cost, the economics for the financing
of the smelter, which we would plan to finance with debt, would be offset by a phaseout of the 5% export
duty we're currently paying. So the economic impact for PT-FI is not material.

On slide -- on the next slide, Slide 16, we provide our 3-year outlook for copper volumes, gold volumes
and molybdenum volumes. We're increasing our copper sales volumes in 2021 to 3.85 billion pounds from
the prior estimate of just over 3.8 billion pounds. And we've increased our 2022 guidance by 100 million
pounds to 4.4 billion pounds of copper, and that's reflective of incremental increases in the U.S. The rest
of the sales estimates are largely unchanged. As Richard mentioned, we're continuing to assess additional
incremental near-term growth opportunities while we conduct our longer-range development planning.

We provided on Slide 17 an overview of our estimated unit net cash cost for the year. You will note that
we have updated our estimate to average $1.33 per pound of copper in net unit cash costs compared with
the prior estimate of $1.25 per pound. A large portion of this increase is associated with higher royalties,

FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

duties and profit sharing related to the change in price assumptions from $3.50 per pound of copper to $4
per pound. We've also increased our cost estimates to reflect higher energy costs, principally oil related,
which our forecast is now higher by about 25%. Our team continues to do a great job in managing costs
efficiently. We have seen some increases, but they have not been significant. Our team continues to look
for creative ways to maintain a low-cost position.

On Slide 18, we show the significance of cash flow generation using our volume and cost estimates. And
we provided sensitivities ranging from $4 per pound copper to $5, and we hold gold flat at $1,750 per
ounce and molybdenum an $11 per pound. The growth in volumes at low incremental costs results in very
significant EBITDA generation. You can see here, ranging from over $12.5 billion per annum on average
for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper to $17 billion per annum at $5 copper. Operating cash flows under these
price scenarios would range from nearly $9 billion to $12 billion. And these cash flows are significantly
above our planned capital spending, providing substantial free cash flows as we go forward.

On Slide 19, we show our capital project forecast and we show projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021,
that includes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter, which again would be debt financed. But
these -- the 2021 guidance numbers are very similar to what we had in our previous reports. Our 2022
capital of $2.2 billion on a consolidated basis is about $200 million higher than our previous forecast and
that incorporates an acceleration of mining investments to bring volumes forward and provide capacity
assurance for our plans. We've entered -- we are in a strong financial position and have entered a period
of exceptional free cash flow generation.

Slide 20 kind of shows you that the exceptional cash flow generation that we have in the business. You
can see on the slide, where in a 6-month period of time, our cash balance has increased by over $2 billion.
Our long-lived asset base, our growing production profile, strong markets provide the ability to continue to
strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset
base. Our financial policy that Richard talked about earlier is designed to tick all of these boxes, and we
look forward to executing on these plans.

And in closing, I'd just say, to echo what Richard said, it's an exciting time at Freeport. We've got the right
assets at the right time, and we're staying focused on continuing our momentum.
And now operator, I would like to open the call for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs.

Emily Christine Chieng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Richard and Kathleen, just a question around the capital allocation policy, and I appreciate that you
updated this a couple of months ago. But it suddenly sounds like there's a significant amount of cash
return potential upcoming of the assumed current copper prices. But maybe on the other side of that,
could you discuss how you're thinking about when the right time to sanction growth would be? And any
color you can provide on sort of long-term or sustainable copper prices that you would need to see or need
the base case in your assumptions for this? And then you mentioned being disciplined and selective, but
as you look over the next couple of years, at what point would you start considering up pulling the trigger
on growth?

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

So Emily, we are -- we have suspended all of our studies on growth projects a year ago. And now we've
resumed those analysis with the purpose of understanding the pros and cons of each of the projects and
developing an evaluation of them. That basic work of valuation we expect to continue at least through the
end of this year. And by the end of the year, we hope to be able to have a clear path path forward. So it
will be some time before there is any commitment to actually initiate significant capital spending. And then
in the meantime, we pointed to all the volume growth that's coming about from Grasberg, the resumption
of operations from COVID, et cetera. So we're going to have increasing volumes with strong prices and
high cash flows, with limited amount of capital being spent because we just won't be ready, as you say, to
sanction projects.

We don't have any particular targeted copper price. We've always looked at a scenario of different prices
that -- of how a new project would fit into our portfolio. We want to take advantage of these resources
that we have and yet have risk management by how they fit into all of our existing portfolio. So we
don't look at it so much on an individual project-by-project basis but how does it fit in with our projects.
Freeport really benefits from the fact that we operate all of the projects we have interest in. So that
allows us to approach these on a -- from a consistent corporate strategic basis as opposed to an individual
project-by-project basis.

Certainly, at these price levels, our projects are economic. And now you know the prospects are for prices
to go much higher. So I anticipate that over time, we will be spending money on capital, that's just not
going to happen in the near term. And that's going to be a feature of the entire industry because even
when we decide to spend, the time frame for developing a project is multiple years, minimum 6 to 8
years. So all of that's going to be, as you well know, Emily, because you write about it all the time, that's
going to be very supportive of copper prices. You can't turn on the valve quickly to add new mine supply.
And when you can't do that and volume and demand rises, that translates into higher prices.

Emily Christine Chieng
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. That's very helpful color. And one quick one, if I could squeeze it in. Just an operational update at
the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. Looks like sales volumes maybe moved out a quarter a little bit.
But anything you can provide on sort of the sustainability of the copper grades we're seeing, any ramp
profile comments that can pace the drilling, belling there, please?

We got Mark Johnson on -- Mark, you want to just give an update on...

Mark J. Johnson
President of Freeport-McMoRan Indonesia

Yes. We're generally on plan. Grades are tracking well from the model to what we see at the mill. In fact,
we're fortunate that the mill is actually seen a little bit more grade and the mine has recorded as pending.
Drawbell opening, it's probably shown in the slides that we did make some adjustments in Deep MLZ. We
slowed down the cave advance in some of our diorite rock types, which are the more challenging rock and
accelerate the cave advance and some of the scarring is going off to the west in PB2. In GBC, we've added
-- accelerated our drawbell opening. And over the 5 years, it's relatively the same.

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

And the fact we referenced delay in shipments, that had nothing to do with operations. Inventory was
there on site. There were loading, shipping, some administrative issues with the government. And so all
that inventory that was produced on-site now will be sold. And as inventory built, we were able to advance
some maintenance activities from the second quarter to the first quarter, all of which is to be supportive of
meeting our plans going forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.

Christopher LaFemina
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Just questions about this -- Richard, the question is about the performance in South America. It was good
to see that you appear to be operating well there despite the escalation of COVID. But we have some
political risk that is potentially escalating there as well, especially in Peru with the upcoming presidential
runoff. So the first question is related to the contracts and licenses that you have in Peru. Is it similar
to what you have in Indonesia where you have a stability agreement with international arbitration
provisions should something go wrong in terms of government trying to significantly increase taxes or try
to nationalize the mine? Is that -- do you have that same sort of protection there?

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Yes, we -- yes, the answer to that is an absolute yes. And we -- stability agreements has been a feature
of the operations in Cerro Verde since way before Freeport, but we we're able to get a new stability
agreement as we expanded the business. And there's always a correlation between the aspirations of
government workers for more funds as copper prices rise and -- but the copper is so critical to Peru in
terms of a country that still faces challenges of poverty and so forth. So we just step back and watch
political environments. We know we have to work with whatever government, wherever in the world that a
country selects, but we do have strong rights to do that.

And unlike some operations in Peru, we have positive relationships with the local community because of
social investments we've made in water and wastewater projects. So our team there is just -- I mean, I
can't tell you what a great job they go. A year ago, we were really worried about Peru. Our workers lived
in the city of Arequipa. There was a real issue with community spread, but we've been put to work with
the community, developed temporary living and got our rates up to near our original run rate targets, and
we can expand further as we go forward. The team there has just done a remarkably good job.

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

And just under the stability agreement, we do -- our taxes are fixed in that agreement, and they are
actually higher than the current statutory rate in Peru. So we've paid higher to get the stability. And we
also pay a lot with the communities and big employer. We have a profit-sharing mechanism there. And

FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

that's partly why you saw the cost increases. So we do -- as the mine becomes more profitable with
higher prices, there's a large profit sharing that goes to employees, partially to employees and partially
to the country. So it's a good model to share economics both to the local communities and country and
workers into the investors.

Christopher LaFemina
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. And with respect to potential expansion at El Abra, we're hearing from other Chilean miners about
challenges getting permits. It seems like, in some cases, permitting is nearly impossible, which I suppose
for the copper market is pretty bullish if companies can't bring capacity online in Chile. But I'm just
wondering in terms of El Abra what sort of permitting hurdles you might have to actually spend that asset?

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

We'll have an environmental impact statement that we will file in connection with the project. So that is a
very comprehensive permitting process. We've gone through it before, and we have to do a lot of baseline
work, et cetera. So there's a lot of work you have to do before you actually submit it. But that project
partially is -- the permitting is partially why Richard saying is 6 to 8 years out.

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

In the best environment, Chris, it's going to take a long time to get that permit. Now we don't have
some of the -- because of where this mine is located and the fact that it's been a long-running existing
operation, it's nearby CODELCO mine. It doesn't have some of the permitting issues that others have. A
major mill expansion would require a desalinization plant and the cost of transmitting that water up to the
high altitudes where we operate. But it's in a setting where we don't face some of the challenges of the
space, but that's case, it takes a long time and it's a big project.

Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi.

Alexander Nicholas Hacking
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Richard, just following up on Chris' question on Peru. I'm not sure how much you could answer here, but
has there been any engagement yet between the mining industry and the candidates, particularly the
candidate that's leading in the polls?

And then secondly, regarding your production footprint, with Chino back in and Cerro Verde heading back
to full rates, does that put Freeport's production footprint back at normalized pre-COVID levels? Or is
there a potential future upside at these prices?

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

I'll take the second one first. Just in terms of the ramp back up, we've made the decision to start ramping
El Abra back up, that's in progress. We expect to get back to pre-COVID levels there in 2022, that's
reflected in our guidance. Same with Cerro Verde.

In the U.S., we had cut back the mining rates significantly. We're starting to ramp those back up. We have
some opportunities, still have some opportunities at Morenci that aren't baked into our forecast yet. And
then we have opportunities at Chino because our plan right now is running Chino at 50%. In addition to
that, as we mentioned, we have some incremental opportunities potentially at Lone Star. So I would say,
in the U.S., we do have some opportunities that aren't in our near-term plans that we'll be assessing as
well as some of the leach technology applications that Richard referred to earlier. So we do have some
near-term opportunities not in our plans, but...

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Kathleen, let's let Josh make a brief comment about that. Josh Olmsted was named this past year to be
our Chief Operating Officer in the Americas. He's been the #2 guy for many years. He's a young guy, but
he's got a long career in Freeport and is just doing an outstanding job in bringing energy and leadership to
our group. So Josh, make a couple of comments.

Joshua Frederick Olmsted
President & COO of Americas

Thanks, Richard. As Kathleen was stating, we have some near-term opportunities with Morenci, Lone Star,
incremental things. The most exciting piece, I think, is the work that we're doing on the leach technology
that both Richard and Kathleen touched on. If we can prove out some of the concepts that we've identified
and began working on, it could have a significant impact on our ability to take advantage of long-term
stockpiles that we have out there that contain copper today that we haven't been able to extract. And so
this leaching technology really could be meaningful as we look for opportunities to get some incremental
low-cost incremental copper as we move forward. And so our plans are working on that this year with the
goal of having, very similar to Richard's comments about the bigger scale projects, having much more
clarity by the end of the year on what that looks like and what the potential value is for us. But we're
super excited about what we're seeing so far.

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

So restarts, technology, leaching all those point to growing volumes from our traditional operations, Chris
-- Alex, right, we are now with Alex now. So Alex on Peru, man, how complicated politics is everywhere
in the world. And in Peru, as they were approaching this runoff, you had 1/2 dozen more candidates each
having 10% plus or minus support in the polls, so it was very complicated. Freeport stays out of politics.
As I said, we don't -- we just run our business, support communities, be prepared to work with whoever
emerges in the political process.

The mining industry in Peru is -- there's active mining association that's led by Peruvians, and they engage
with candidates to understand and interact and communicate with them on policies affecting mining. And
I'm sure they will be working with both of these candidates as we go forward. And you will notice the
candidate, who earlier was being very aggressive in talking about mining, is now making comments about
the importance of mining to Peru. So all of that will come to play, and we'll just have to see what happens.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America.

Timna Beth Tanners
BofA Securities, Research Division

I wanted to ask a little bit more about cost. Obviously, you went through in the detail about what caused
the incremental cost in the quarter and in the guidance. But how -- obviously, costs are rising and inflation
is a big topic. I mean, do you think that this encapsulates the future costs that you could bear fully? Or
are you seeing further pressure? And can you detail where that could come from and a little bit of what
you've been seeing in more detail?

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

So the first point I want to make is a point Kathleen referenced earlier. Some important elements of our
costs are correlated to copper prices. They're correlated. I mean things like royalties, this profit-sharing
plans, labor cost in general, there's correlation. Then there's other input costs that are correlated. Energy
cost, which is an important element of cost and energy costs have risen in recent months. Copper prices
have risen even more, thankfully, but energy costs are built into that. And then certain other costs are
seeing some inflation. So far, energy costs are the ones that are outside of the profit-sharing. Royalty

13

FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

costs are the ones that have the biggest impact. And as time goes by and copper prices rise, we'll have to
deal with inflation. But we have such strong margins, we have a great supply group team that works with
our suppliers to offset costs wherever we can. We're working really aggressively to do that.

So Timna, I think -- I mean, I know you realize this because you're right about it, but inflation is good for
copper. I mean inflation is good for copper. What the world is doing today with all this spending on COVID
recovery, with spending around the world that's being driven to deal with economic inequalities, that's
pushing money to people who consume to create economic velocity, which creates demand for copper. So
in the broader sense, all these forces will work to the benefit of our company.

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Yes. And what's been interesting is you look at today, $4.25 copper. Last time copper was $4.25, oil wasn't
at $60. It might have been $110 a barrel. So we are benefiting from the lower energy prices. Even though
they have come up some, the historical correlations just aren't as correlated as they once were. And we
go through a review each quarter on where we are with our supply chain and revise our forecast every
quarter to reflect current pricing and that sort of thing. So that's baked into these plans. And as Richard
said whether we'll have additional cost pressures from tightening freight markets or other supplies, we'll
have to see where that goes, but right now the forecast that we developed is based on what our pricing
contracts are currently.

Timna Beth Tanners
BofA Securities, Research Division

It's a high-quality problem, but if we're assuming a bit higher copper price, for example, we should also
incorporate, it sounds like, some assumption of inflation as well?

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Well, as I said, yes. The answer is yes. There's correlations. I mean, royalties rise, profit sharing rise and
then you make your judgment about energy, steel costs and so forth, but -- and I know I'm a broken
record, Timna. I know you understand, but bottom line is margins rise. For many businesses, these
inflationary movements deteriorate margins. Historically, our margins have stayed very strong as copper
prices rise and other cost rise.

I have a question on the Indonesia smelter, and wondering if you can help me understand the risks
around the pace of the project. So there was the disclosure in your 10-K about the fine, and there's
been some comments in the press. I'm just wondering what you're expecting. Is it possible through this
discussion and looking at the options that you could see more fines or you could see more frustration from
Indonesian government? Or do you think it's going the other way and it will get resolved?

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

I'm going to let Kathleen talk about this. She's acting -- working more actively with the parties there
and negotiating the terms. We are going to cooperate with the government. We made a commitment in
December '18 to build a smelter. And I won't -- I'm very clear that we recognize that commitment, and
we are prepared to honor it. There are different views within the government of Indonesia. When you
referenced the government, it could be interpreted as being a one group. There are different views within
the government itself about whether to support this development and we'd obey or go forward with the
project at Gresik that we initially started. And so we are working closely with our partner and shareholder,

MIND ID, and with the Ministry of state-owned enterprises, with the Ministry of Energy and Mines, to
find what is best -- what decision the government has made, and we're prepared to go forward, provided
we have -- if we go in the direction. We debate we have reasonable terms and reasonable regulatory
environment.

So Kathleen, why don't you talk about this and then the mine ministry wants to push us. I believe we'll
resolve this situation and that everything is going to be okay. But Kathleen, why don't you give some...

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Okay. Under the regulations, the government grants annual export licenses. And then there is a 6-month
check to evaluate your progress against the smelter development schedule that they have and they have
approved. As a result of COVID, as we said during 2020, we notified the government that our schedule
was impacted by the pandemic, and there were force majeure conditions that prevented us from achieving
the schedule. And under regulations, there's potential for fines if you don't achieve the schedule, and
that's what the government did, they levied this fine. And we have gone in and explained to them the
reasons why the project was delayed and that this was a force majeure, which is allowed under the
regulations to waive any penalty. So we're in those discussions with the government. They're asking
for some additional support for our position and details. I mean, it's obvious that this COVID affected
schedules for projects all around the world, but they are asking for some more details. We think it will get
resolved in a mutually satisfactory way.

But as Richard said, we're also very focused on meeting our commitment to the government ultimately.
We notified them that we had a 12-month delay in reaching the -- because of COVID, reaching the
deadline of December 23 to construct the new smelter, and now we expect that, that wouldn't be
completed until 2024. This option that Richard is referring to, we debate potentially could get us back
on schedule. And we just need to make sure that it fits with -- from a commercial standpoint and overall
business risk standpoint. But we're working closely with the government. I can say that our interest,
having our partner, MIND ID, our interests are very much aligned. And we're all on the same page in
terms of what we need to do, and we're just working our way through the government's regulations to
resolve this issue and I'm confident we will.

Matthew Murphy
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Kathleen, so the outcome of the discussion with the government, would that be the completion of sort of a
new smelter progress schedule that gave you that contract?

Kathleen Lynne Quirk

discussions with them on this administrative fine.

the status of the negotiations between commercial parties maybe for a third party to do the investment
in the major smelter? Are those still ongoing or have they stopped, and we should now come back and
think more about PTI doing -- PT-FI dealing the matter on its own? And then on CapEx, and it's not a
big increase, but CapEx outlook for 2022 increase about $200 million related to other projects. Is there

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Yes. Well, on the last question...

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Let me just say on last question, it's good news, Carlos. Higher copper prices gives you an incentive to
spend money to increase values. And so these are items that were largely in our long-term plans that
we're advancing to create value. Right, Kathleen?

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Yes. Yes. That's exactly right. We brought forward some capital. We've also increased production. So that's
what that was. It's basically mining equipment investments. The first part of it in terms of the negotiations
and we don't publicly comment on details of the negotiations while they are still in progress, but we had
all set a target of trying to get the commercial agreement with the third-party done by the end of March.
And so there were extensive negotiations that went back and forth during the first quarter. By the end of
March, we had not reached an acceptable agreement.

And we have been moving in parallel this other project. At some point, we've got to make a decision. We
haven't finalized that decision yet. But we are moving the greenfield, our own project, forward so that we
can meet our obligations to the governments and not rely solely on a third party. So at this point, we are
still having some discussions with the third party, but we're moving the other one in parallel as well. So as
soon as we get a final decision, and believe me, we all want that as soon as possible, we'll convey that to
you.

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Carlos, it's -- and when we talk there, we say -- I was listening to Kathleen, some of the weirdest
decisions by the government. The we in Indonesia is the PT-FI, which is a partnership between MIND ID
and FCX. FCX operates, but we, in Indonesia, is that partnership along with the Ministry of state-owned
enterprises. This a different world from those of you who followed us for all of the years we were dealing
with the government when FCX has to take the lead, and really, me personally was there on the ground
on these negotiations. Now we're there very much as a team. And as Kathleen says, it's aligned and it's in
much better environment than we had historically.

drop to that date in terms of which direction that goes? I mean, certainly, you can't drag this on forever.

Richard C. Adkerson

No, it's the government. I mean, it's really -- it is the government who's going to make that decision. We
are prepared -- if we could get -- if the government supports it and we could get a reasonable deal with
concentrate sale terms in a regulatory environment dealing with our IUPK obligations, PT-FI is prepared to
deal with Weda Bay.

to keep in mind that while this is a big project and it's a management issue, it's not a huge financial
issue to FCX. I mean, we were paying a 5% export duty, that would be relieved with the smelter. The
financial implications are not that significant. And more than 70% of the financial implications go to the
government through taxes and equity share ownership. So...

Kathleen Lynne Quirk

to make this decision very soon.

decision between the government and PT-FI.

Orest Wowkodaw
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

I see. Okay. Is it fair to assume -- I mean, given that benchmark or spot TCs for copper are so depressed
right now that in order for a third party to agree to build the smelter that -- is it fair to assume that they'd
be looking for some kind of stability in the TCs perhaps that are at higher levels?

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Yes.

John Charles Tumazos
John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC

Is it, say, 2026?

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Yes. Bagdad could come on quicker than the other 2. You know the long lead times for investments for KL
-- and Kucing Liar, that's in our long-term plan. We're just optimizing it now. So that -- and that capital
will be spent over a long period of time. And then El Abra, just from a sequencing standpoint, would come
behind Bagdad from a time period that it could come online. So you're talking about -- if you started
everything, right now, you're talking about 7 years out with all the permitting process, 7, 8 years maybe,
with all the permitting process. But Bagdad could be done probably on your 2025-type time line if we --
depending on when we start.

John Charles Tumazos
John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC

If I can ask one more. I recall Kucing Liar drill results that were very good in the '90s. How recently has
that been drilled and updated? So you have access and you've updated those studies and have more
information.

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Yes. Mark, why don't we talk about...

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We've also -- John, you will probably remember that Kucing Liar has pyrite content. And so Mark,
talk about how we've been working on -- and this has been a continual work project. It is independent
of Grasberg Block Cave, Deep MLC and our other operations. But Mark, maybe comment on how we've
updated our analysis of KL?

Mark J. Johnson
President of Freeport-McMoRan Indonesia

Yes. I mean, in the last 3 years or so, there was a significant change, wasn't so much new drilling. We did
do some drilling over the last couple of years. And we revisited some of the metallurgical work. The big
change there was, and as Richard alluded to, the original KL mine plan was more focused on higher copper
equivalent grade, but it also had much higher pyrite and required a significant change to our processing.
The new mine plan focuses on some slightly lower copper equivalent portion of the resource that has now
become the reserve. And we've -- and it's part of the ore body. Essentially, we leave the mill as it is. The
pyrite problem is largely diminished and almost eliminated.

So the overall capital as far as processing, power requirements, environmental management have
dropped significantly. In addition, this new portion of the new mine plan, the areas that we mine, the gold
recoveries go up substantially. We -- in our initial reserves, several years ago, gold recoveries were below
50%. The new plan has gold recoveries over 60%, and we think there's upside there. So it's a much less
capital-intensive, much more robust plan, a lot less environmental management costs to go with this new
KL plan.

The one thing, Richard mentioned it, it's independent, but in some ways, it does tie in. We share parts of
the GBC ore flow system. KL ramps up. And in coordination with the GBC plan, we used some of the same
conveyor. And then the big part was that the mill is relatively unchanged with this new plan.

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

And so John -- yes, Mark. So John, this is not a competing project to our Americas growth plan. I mean,
it's in our long-term plan, as Kathleen said. It fits in with everything we're doing out there. And then the
trade-offs of where we invest in the Americas is one where we will be looking at the pros and cons of each
project. In the U.S., we have no royalties because we own the land and sea. We have no taxes because of
our tax laws carryforward for a very long period of time and tax rates in the U.S. are very low. So I mean
all of this, this is an after-tax, after-royalty economic analysis. And we're going to decide where can we
add value most economically for our shareholders.

Michael Stephan Dudas
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Richard and Kathy, maybe to follow up on your thoughts on investment for Freeport. Certainly, looking
at after-tax returns, copper price, et cetera, taxes, how much more will ESG be involved in some of the
analysis that not only you, but the industry is going to have to work on to? Is that going to add significant
hurdles, generally? Some -- obviously, you have to have a social license to operate in, we understand that.
But is it because of the more importance, is that going to be helpful? And is that going to add hurdles to
some of this long-term investment that the industry is going to require to meet the demand needs going
forward?

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

It's not only -- it is today. I mean, it is today. And I mean ESG matters are not something that's common
across all projects. They're all site-specific related. I made a point, and I think you probably picked up
on it, in talking about our growth projects in Arizona, being supported by communities and by Native
American groups. That's because we've been there for so long, and we have devoted attention and
resources to those communities and to providing opportunities beyond just our separate operations.

Elsewhere, in Arizona even which has a favorable state view for mining development, there are huge
barriers from an ESG standpoint to developments. And you just look at Rosemont and Resolution and
other projects. So you have to go and look at each particular project, each -- the way companies provide
it, but it's enormous barrier, and it's going to grow. I mean, the number of groups that are involved in
ESG attention, you see it with institutional investors which you are aware with. But consumer groups are
very focused. Automobile manufacturers are focused about where their minerals are coming from, where
is their copper coming from. That's why this copper mark thing that I referenced is so important. So it's

on supply development. So...

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Yes. And it's always been part of our project evaluation. It's even more so today, but it's always been part
of our evaluation is using less energy, diversifying our energy sources to looking at renewables. Water is
a big issue that we manage. We found a great solution in Cerro Verde in Peru when we did that project,
where we built a wastewater treatment plant to get water. So we didn't compete with other uses of water
in the country and actually helped the community. So we're always looking as part of our projects how
does this project help the community, and ESG has always been part of it. And as Richard said, it's just
growing -- going much, much larger. I guess you know this, but copper is really a great story. We don't
have the Scope 3 emissions that other companies have to deal with. Copper is actually -- what copper is
used for is actually used for decarbonization. But the Scope 1 and 2 areas is something that we work hard
on every day, and it's all part of our project development plans, the capital investment plans.

Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS.

Andreas Bokkenheuser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Just a quick operational question, a 2 part one actually. Obviously, we saw production a bit higher in Q1
versus sales. Can you just comment a little bit further about the restocking? I think you were saying also
that there might be some gold sales at Grasberg that are going to get delayed into sales in Q2. So what
kind of drove that?

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Okay. So let me address that. We don't sell copper and gold in Grasberg. We sell copper concentrate. It's
got copper and gold in it. We get paid for the individual components at LME prices. But as I mentioned
earlier, what happened at Grasberg is we met our production targets, we transported this copper
concentrate to the port site to be ready to ship, some shipments got delayed for various reasons. And so
the production is done. And we recognize sales when the concentrates loaded on ships. So literally, all we
have is some of those sales are going to be in the second quarter more than first quarter. And it's just that
simple. And throughout our operations, we have timing issues like that. For those of you who follow the
Grasberg, we have weather conditions at ports. It's a shallow water sea, and so weather conditions can
delay shipments. But all this ends up being strictly a timing. Whether it's at the last of the first quarter or
the early part of the second quarter is irrelevant.

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Yes. Generally, our production equals our sales. And we did have some both in the U.S. and in Indonesia.
We did have some changes between production and sales, but that's, like Richard said, just timing.

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

As you can imagine, we can sell everything we produce. That's not an issue.

Andreas Bokkenheuser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Absolutely. That's very clear. And then a follow-up question. You've obviously been mentioning that you
expect the output of the Peru and Cerro Verde to kind of return to normal next year. Are there any other

mines in your global portfolios that are right now kind of feeling the pressure of any COVID restrictions or
anything of that nature where you expect there could be a bit of a volume ramp-up going into next year?

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Well, we mentioned we restarted -- we had actually suspended operations at the Chino mine in New
Mexico, a relatively small mine, but we're resuming operations there. We reduced mine rate stripping
rates at Morenci to conserve costs, and that will take some time to restore and production will build up
from there. But it's nothing of real significance. The amazing thing is the guys, Mark and his team at
Grasberg have just been remarkable with meeting our targets there in the face of a very challenging
COVID location. And we've done a remarkable job in managing all that and continue to.

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Yes. I'd say logistically, in South America is where we have the biggest constraints currently. But we're
still dealing with it all over in terms of protocols, et cetera. So we're not letting up the guard. And we're
continuing to be very, very careful about how we operate and make sure people are safe. But in terms of
the logistical side of things, it's mainly impacted South America.

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Okay. We have an internal medical director. We work with international SOS for years. And they've been
fabulous in helping us build testing facilities and facilities for dealing with infected people. We're able to
treat them, get them back to work, and that's an ongoing process.

Andreas Bokkenheuser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. That's clear. So for South America, the expected plan is the ramp up happens in the second half and
then you're kind of back at full run rate early 2022. Is that the right way of thinking about it?

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Well, in Peru, specifically, our plan is to run at this reduced freight all year long, and we'll assess that as
we go. But right now, the going-in assumption is that we will be in the situation for the balance of 2021
and then go back to the plan in 2022. That's the assumption. In Chile, it's a smaller operation, but we
are beginning to increase our mining and stacking rates there. And the metal impact will happen in 2022,
but we're starting that now. So -- but our plan at Cerro Verde, which is our largest operation in South
America, is to be at the slightly lower rate in the balance of the year. The team did a great job and was
able to surpass expectations in the first quarter. But it's not something that we feel is prudent to assume
because the restrictions are still very, very significant.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities.

Lucas Nathaniel Pipes
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Richard, Kathleen, most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I wanted to circle back,
Richard, to some of the earlier comments you made regarding this being one of the best copper markets
outlooks you've seen. And in the -- in light of that, when we think about the framework for retaining
capital versus returning capital, to what extent could this be subject to review? We spend a lot of time on
this call talking about organic growth, for example. So could there be an incentive to toggle this ratio more
towards the growth side? And then along the same vein, M&A, have your views on that evolved? And if so,

what geography could make sense? Would you be -- could you be looking at producing miners or would
you book preproduction? Would appreciate any updated thoughts on that as well.

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

That's a very good multilayered question. Let me see if I can answer it precisely. Yes, I've been around
a long time. And I say there's 3 kind of eras of copper demand, pre-early 2000s, it was all driven by
developed countries' GDP. Copper is most correlated commodity to GDP, and it would rise and fall based
on business cycles. China emerged and now for almost 2 decades has dominated new demand growth.
It's all come from China when you look at it. The rest of the world has kind of been flat. The new era
today, which is so exciting, is China's rate of growth, which people have been pointing to for some time,
inevitably is falling, has to fall.

COVID's kind of complicated all that up. But its absolute demand for copper volumes is so strong
because this economy has grown and that's going to continue with the -- even as it pivots its economy
to consumers and exports, its -- the absolute amount of copper that it grows, even though the rate of
growth will drop, absolutely will not be strong. Now -- the reason I'm so excited about now is, now you've
got -- it's COVID recovered in the developed world, but also all this movement around the world, you see
it clearly here in the United States, to push money to a broader set of people to enhance consumption.
All this move towards incoming in equality, which everybody recognize we got to do. And that's going to
create new copper demand.

And then my long-term story has always been in the undeveloped world, global growth, all the vast
numbers of people around the world that are living in substandard conditions have aspirations of having
better conditions, that requires more energy, more transportation, communication, more copper. So that's
why I say the demand side, to me, is in a new era, and it's really positive. And the supply side, I don't
know how it's going to keep up with it. I literally don't. Here, we have all of these projects at Freeport.

The price of copper could double overnight. Some people are talking about it doubling anyway, but
overnight. And we could not do new production of significance for a number of years, for a number of
years. So it's going to be really interesting to see prices -- I just -- unless there's some global calamity,
prices, it just seems to me, clearly have to rise substantially. Substitution has to occur. Scrap has to
grow. But how to meet that demand? And that's why I'm so thrilled about where we are after all this time
working to put this company together. John Tumazos referenced it. I mean, we've been through so much.
But I recall, Kathleen and I developed a strategy in 2003, 2004 when I became CEO of focusing on copper.
And now it's so great here, all these years later to see it coming to fruition.

Lucas Nathaniel Pipes
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division

Very helpful. So...

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

And in terms of the M&A question, we're really focused on our existing assets. We've got development
options within the portfolio. We always monitor what's available externally and compare that against what
we have. So...

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Let me add just a personal observation on that. Our company made a misstep, other mining companies
made missteps when they forced M&A for strategic reasons. You just look over and over again. Phelps
Dodge came to us as an opportunity. It wasn't a strategic plan to do it. We had talked with them
about buying us. So where we are now is we have no strategy of engaging in M&A markets. But we'll
be positioned now, for the first time in a long, long time, to -- if an opportunity comes to us to take
advantage of. Our strategy is straightforward: execute, invest in a disciplined way in our resources that

22

FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

provide growth that create value. If something comes to us, we're going to be in a position to consider it,
but that's not our strategic objective.

You mentioned start-up operations, and that's come to us all the time. But we have trouble -- it's been a
big barrier to make the economics of those work because to get into it, you've got to pay the value that's
been made already. When we have all of these other resources in our portfolio where there's no value
being given to them in our share price. So we see -- that's been a real barrier of making even what might
be, at some level, interesting projects work economically for our company. And we've had a long saying at
Freeport, "Big mines get bigger and small mines get smaller." So that's also a tough issue.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas.

Jatinder Goel
Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division

Just one on smelter. To get a bit more clarity, is it only one party that you are engaging with on out,
potentially outsourcing the smelter? Or are they multiparties? The reason for asking, you might have
seen a news release or a media article last week that Indonesia has signed MOU with ENSI, and that's in
West Papua where Freeport has said to have committed to 800,000 tonnes of raw material as well, which
doesn't seem to align with the full scale of smelters or not sure if you're looking at just one smelter one
part or are there multiple elements to it?

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Yes. The discussions to date has been most extensive with the project at Weda Bay. The project that
you're referring to is in Papua, a potential project. And we are familiar with the developer there and have
indicated that if there's excess capacity, we may be able to supply. But our options, right now, we are
focused on the base supply. We are focused on either this Weda Bay option or our project at Gresig.

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Yes. We -- in response to your comment, we've made no commitment for supply on the Papua project.
For years, we would have liked to have seen a smelter developed in Papua because it would be desirable
to help the local community there. But the infrastructure cost, the absence of infrastructure, the timing,
investment that will be acquired for infrastructure have made it impractical in the past.

Operator

Our final question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.

Brian MacArthur
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division

I'd like to go back and talk a little bit about KL because finally, after years of getting closer, but it does
sound like the project, as for John's comment, has changed. So I just want to try and understand a little
bit because when you look at the grade of this, at the point, the reserve grade is, whatever, 0.9 copper
and 0.9 gram per tonne gold. So it's a little more gold than some of the others. So in this new plan, I
guess my first question is, you talked about certain areas of the ore body. Is there an area that's higher
grade which you start, which helps the economics?

And my second question, it sounds like the new plan obviously saves CapEx, which is good. Technically,
probably is easier, which is good. But then you talk about lower copper equivalencies, so I'm trying to
figure out just how much lower that copper equivalency is? And secondary, that obviously, that depends
on price assumptions, too. So this sounds pretty good.

FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 22, 2021

Yes. We'll let Mark talk about it. But the -- there's a section of the mine that -- and we did the same
thing with the Grasberg Block Cave development. We modified it over time to focus on the lowest
pyrite sections. And what Mark will tell you is that with KL, we redesigned the mine plan to reduce the
capital intensity because in order to get the pyrite, there's more capital in the mill, more environmental
management required and the recovery starts going down. You mentioned the 0.9, but it has a very low
recovery, some of the ore. So what we have developed here is a more optimal plan that reduces upfront
CapEx and modestly changes the total ore. But from a metal standpoint, you're actually ending up with
similar metal because you've got higher recoveries. So Mark, do you want to add to...

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Just -- and then we'll turn to Mark. But it's not that complicated. It's -- we have designed a new mine plan
to avoid and minimize the pyrite section. So -- and by doing that, we reduced mill investments plus there
was going to have to be a pipeline -- you've been out there, a pipeline from the mill, down the lowlands of
storage for pyrite and lowland. So Mark, it's more of an engineering design determination, which gets all
of these economic benefits than anything else. Mark?

Mark J. Johnson
President of Freeport-McMoRan Indonesia

Yes. And I think the major advance was understanding where the -- not necessarily the highest grade but
we're the highest value after-capital investment was in the ore body. And if not for having a debt -- our
contract with the government goes up to 2041. If not for that, the material that we've deferred would also
be in reserves. So what we've done in this new plan is brought forward -- there's about half of the old
reserve that overlaps with the old reserve. And then there's another half where we've deferred a part of
the lower-value ore and being able to substitute it with higher-value ore. This order that we're now mining
would be sediment hosted, very similar to what we've milled for years in the DOZ, Deep MLZ.

The old reserve was very much centered on this fault that had the highest grades, but had, as Richard
and Kathleen mentioned, some of the bigger challenges where a new mill we had to grind it much finer.
That came with additional power requirements. And then we had to manage the pyrite, which for us is to
segregate it from the [ Mod-88 ] and store it separately. So by recognizing all the costs that are associated
with some of the higher copper equivalent grade, that's a combination of the copper and gold value, and
substitute it with looking more on a value rather than purely on copper equivalency. We came up with a
much more optimal sequencing of the mine with the opportunity to go after this other material at a later
date if we had the opportunity to mine beyond 2041.

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

And as Mark said, reduce risk, more robust plan. And we're doing some things right now to continue to try
to enhance those gold recoveries.

Brian MacArthur
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division

And can you with this new plan -- I mean, I forgot what the original rate you figured KL was going to go
through it. Can you actually offset at a higher mining rate because, I think you'd still have mill capacity at
240,000 tonnes, too, right? Does that offset it in there? Or is it still sort of the same rate there?

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

It's very similar mining rates that we had before. The tonnage is similar. It's a little bit less because we
started a little bit later. But this does fill the 240,000 tonnes of mill capacity that we'll have with the Seg 3.
And so there's obviously a district-wide plan that we sequence all of the ore bodies to best fill that mill in
an optimal fashion. This would peak at 90,000 tonnes a day, just marginally above what we're planning to

do with Deep MLZ. And it ramps up as GDC would start to drop off. And so it's a balancing of the highest
value material getting the first opportunity for mill space.

Brian MacArthur
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division

Great. That's very helpful. And it certainly sounds like it's a much more profit risk-adjusted, capital-intense
project that maybe it was thought of 15 years ago when we first looked at this, I guess.

Kathleen Lynne Quirk
President & CFO

Yes.

Richard C. Adkerson
Chairman & CEO

Yes, correct. Exactly right.

Now I will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.

being on our call, and we look forward to continuing to report our progress as we go forward in this year
and following years. Thank you.
