Presentation

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to the Align Technology, Inc. Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy, VP, Corporate Communications
and Investor Relations.

Shirley Stacy
Vice President of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate
Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO;
and John Morici, CFO. We issued second quarter 2021 financial results today via GlobeNewswire, which is
available on our website at investor.aligntech.com.

Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 1
month. A telephone replay will be available by approximately 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time through 5:30 p.m.
Eastern Time on August 11. To access the telephone replay, domestic callers should dial 877-660-6853
with conference number 13720779 followed by #. International callers should dial 201-612-7415 with the
same conference number.

As a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements,
including statements about Align's future events and product outlook. These forward-looking statements
are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most

information.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights
from the second quarter then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, System and
Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook.
Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.

I'm pleased to report our first $1 billion revenue quarter with record volumes reflecting continued
momentum from both Clear Aligners and Systems and Services. For Q2, Systems and Services revenues
reflect strong growth across all regions and the strategic value of the iTero business with continued
adoption of the iTero Element 5D Plus Series of next-generation scanners and imaging systems, which
launched in February. Increasingly, doctors are seeing the strategic impact and value of iTero scanners in
their practices. In addition to its role in Invisalign case submissions, it's true -- it's a true workhorse and
digital enabler in every type of practice and across every type of orthodontic and restorative workflow.

Q2 sequential Clear Aligner volumes were primarily driven by strength in both adult and teen market
segments and across customer channels and regions, especially from the Americas and EMEA regions,
reflecting the expanding opportunity for Invisalign treatment among adults globally as well as the
underlying orthodontic market as we continue to build awareness of the Invisalign brand and drive
utilization among teens and younger patients.

ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

For Q2 '21, Invisalign clear aligner volumes for teens were up 9.5% sequentially, 156% year-over-year
to 181,000 teens, representing 1/3 of total cases shipped, with strong growth from North America and
EMEA orthodontists. During the quarter, we hosted several teen-focused peer-to-peer events designed to
build clinical confidence in teen treatment and highlight the teen digital treatment journey with Invisalign
treatment. The recent APAC virtual symposium featured leading providers focusing on clinical excellence
with teen treatment, and North America hosted the Invisalign Teen Forum: Virtual Edition for Invisalign
doctors, bringing together clinical speakers, digital industry experts and teen patient panelists to share
their insights. In May, Align focused on the Align Digital Platform at the 2021 AAO annual session,
featuring a dynamic virtual lineup of Invisalign doctors describing how they have grown their practices
through adoption of digital technology.

Our Q2 results also reflect the positive impact of our investments in consumer marketing, generating
billions of impressions and 33% year-over-year increase in leads for Invisalign doctors. During the quarter,
we launched the next phase of our Mom/Teen multitouch campaign as well as the new "Invis is a powerful
thing" campaign designed to engage teens and young adults. We also deepened our partnership with
influencers like Charli D’Amelio, with the first limited-edition aligner case as part of our new e-commerce
initiative featuring custom cases, cleaning and oral care products as well as accessories like Invisalign
Stickables, all of which are available on invisalign.com. These and other consumer initiatives are important
in supporting doctors' practices, especially through the busy summer teen season and beyond. They also
build out our investments in digital technology and innovation that are the foundation of the Align Digital
Platform, including integrated digital workflows and virtual tools designed to improve clinical confidence,
treatment, efficiency and patient outcomes.

A year ago, we released Invisalign Virtual Appointment and Invisalign Virtual Care tools within our My
Invisalign app in response to the global pandemic to enable Invisalign doctors to provide continuity of care
for their patients. Today, Invisalign Virtual Care is available globally in 60 markets, and the My Invisalign
app has been downloaded 1 million times with Invisalign patients worldwide. It was recently recognized as
the Best Virtual Care Platform by the MedTech Breakthrough Awards program and as a Digital Innovation
of the Year by Healthcare Asia Medtech Awards. As part of the Invisalign Virtual Care, patients use My
Invisalign app to stay engaged with their treatment and convey progress photos to their doctor, fostering
2-way communications with a doctor through their Invisalign treatment journey.

Now let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the
Americas region, Q2 was another strong quarter, with Invisalign case volumes up 11% sequentially and
261% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region, especially in the United States and Canada,
from both comprehensive and non-comprehensive products, and increased Invisalign utilization from
orthodontic and GP channels. DSO utilization continues to be a strong growth driver as well, led by
Heartland and Smile Docs.

For international business, Q2 Invisalign case volume was up sequentially 12.7% on a year-over-year
basis. International shipments were up 149%.

For EMEA, Q2 volumes were up sequentially, 17% and 265% year-over-year, with broad-based growth
across all markets, led by Iberia, U.K. and Italy, along with continued growth in our expansion markets. In
Q2, growth in both channels was strong, with orthodontic channel growth reflecting increased Invisalign
utilization and GP channel growth driven by increased Invisalign submitters. For Q2, EMEA growth also
reflects adoption of the Invisalign First product, designed to treat a broad range of teeth-straightening
issues in growing children from simple to complex, including crowding, spacing and narrow dental
arches. Aiding in treatment engagement for those younger patients, Invisalign Stickables are innovative
accessories designed exclusively for use with a patented SmartTrack material in Invisalign clear systems.
Available in an array of designs, colors, shapes and themes, Invisalign Stickables are a fun way for
patients to show their personal style during Invisalign treatment. During the quarter, we also hosted a
successful virtual edition of GP Growth Summit attended by over 1,200 doctors from the EMEA region.

For APAC, Q2 volumes were up sequentially 4.8% and 50% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting growth
across the region, led by Japan, China and ANZ despite new and extended COVID restrictions in several
APAC markets. APAC performance reflects strength in GP channel with increased Invisalign submitters,

ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

especially in Japan which continues to deliver strong growth. During the quarter, we hosted our China
Forum attended by over 1,500 doctors from private clinics, our APAC Virtual Symposium attended by
1,400 doctors, as well as the China Public Hospital Forum in June.

Our consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving
that demand for Invisalign doctor's offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to
transform 500 million smiles. We have provided many of our key metrics that show increased activity
engagement with the Invisalign brand in our Q2 quarterly presentation slides available on aligntech.com.

In Q2, we launched the next generation of "Invis is" multitouch campaign, driving reach and awareness
with adult mom and teen consumers, yielding more than 200% growth in visitors globally to our websites
and more than 82% increase in searches for an Invisalign-trained doctor. Leading with the "Invis is not
your parents' braces" campaign, we connected with teens, utilizing digital media such as YouTube, Twitch
and social media. We also continued with our Invisalign ChangeMakers program that celebrated and
recognized teens driving change in their communities, which was covered by multiple media outlets such
as Elite Daily, Refinery29, Yahoo! Unwind, Hollywood Life, SheKnows, J-14, Yahoo Finance, Parents.com,
Glamour and NewBeauty, and generated more than 600 million impressions.

In EMEA region, our new marketing campaign to drive engagement, "Invis is a powerful thing," went live
in the U.K., Germany and France during the quarter, resulting in more than 170% year-over-year increase
in unique visitors and 136% year-over-year increase in doctor locator searches. We will continue to roll
out the campaign to additional markets in the region during the third quarter. We continued to expand
our consumer advertising in the APAC region in Australia, Japan and China and saw more than an 800%
increase in consumer engagement and 55% year-over-year increase in leads.

Lastly, we continue to build strong relationship with global search and social media giants like Google,
Snapchat and TikTok in order to further leverage our best-in-class consumer demand programs more
effective globally. These partners recognize the power of the Invisalign brand and are helping us to amplify
and gain efficiencies from our investments.

For our Systems and Services business, Q2 revenues were up 20% sequentially and up 214% year-over-
year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of
sequential revenue growth.

The iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system continues to gain traction across all regions, with strong
adoption with new customers in the APAC and EMEA regions and with existing customers in the Americas
region. In APAC, the iTero Element 2 intraoral scanner did well during the quarter, helping to transform
digital workflows and chairside consults for doctors. During the quarter, we announced a new iTero
Workflow 2.0 software and previewed auto-upload functionality in the iTero Element 5D imaging system.
The iTero Workflow 2.0 software's advanced features include faster scanning, improved visualization and
enhanced patient communication tools, were rolled out regionally in all markets where the iTero Element
Plus imaging systems are sold. The iTero Element 5D imaging system auto-upload feature will eliminate
steps and streamline Invisalign case submissions, with intraoral color scan images that can be used in
place of traditional intraoral photos. The auto-upload functionality is scheduled for release during the third
quarter of 2021.

There's great symmetry between Systems and Services business with Clear Aligner business reflected in
the positive correlation between the deployment of scanners and the increased utilization of Invisalign
clear aligners. In terms of digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions, total digital scans in Q2
increased to 82.2% from 78.5% in Q2 last year. International scans increased to 76.2%, up from 72% in
the same quarter last year. For the Americas, 86.6% of cases were submitted digitally compared to 86%
a year ago. Cumulatively, over 40.1 million orthodontic scans and 8.4 million restorative scans have been
performed with iTero scanners. I'm also pleased to share that Align received regulatory approval for the
iTero 5D Plus Series in Japan on July 1, with a formal launch event planned for August.

Turning to exocad. During the quarter, exocad launched the Creator Center, the new exocad one-stop
shop for online and in-person educational events, with a database consisting of 35 educational webinars
showcasing the highlights and add-on features of exocad's software solutions, DentalCAD Galway 3.0,

exoplan 3.0 Galway. More than 2,500 users and distributors have been trained on the new software
releases worldwide.

exocad has also expanded their market coverage with a new global OEM partner, Ivoclar Vivadent, or we
call IV, one of the largest manufacturers in the dental industry. This strategic collaboration will give exocad
access to thousands of new IV users worldwide, will also provide exocad users with access to production
processes with removable prosthetics in the future.

Earlier this month, exocad has released PartialCAD 3.0 Galway, its module for removable partial dental
frameworks, which has new and advanced features for the design of high-quality partial dentures. This
new release enhances digital CAD/CAM possibilities for exocad users and dental technicians by providing
simpler design solutions for complex cases. PartialCAD 3.0 Galway provide both experts and new users
with smooth, improved integration with DentalCAD, exocad's leading software for dental laboratories.

Bringing the iTero and exocad businesses together makes us more viable within the GP segment and
more relevant in day-to-day comprehensive dentistry for our customers. The combination of Invisalign
clear aligners and iTero scanners have long provided a seamless workflow for orthodontic treatment.
The integration of exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry and implantology, guided surgery and smile
design takes the Align technical portfolio beyond our established footprint in orthodontics to ortho-
restorative and restorative treatment and paves the way for new, cross-disciplinary workflows that
span from visualization and treatment planning to lab production to chairside. exocad also broadens
Align's platform reach in digital dentistry with over 200 partners and more than 40,000 licenses installed
worldwide.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Thanks, Joe. Let me begin by reminding everyone that for Align and many companies, Q2 2020 was
significantly impacted by COVID-19 business disruptions, and comparisons of our results for Q2 2021
should be considered accordingly.

Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1 billion, up 13% from the
prior quarter and up 186.9% from the corresponding quarter a year ago.

For Clear Aligners, Q2 revenues of $841 million were up 11.6% sequentially and up 181.9% year-over-
year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth in most geographies. In Q2, we shipped a record 665,600
Invisalign cases, an increase of 11.7% sequentially and 200% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped to a
record 83,500 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which approximately 7,200 were first-time customers.

Q2 Clear Aligner revenues reflect strong growth across the Invisalign portfolio for both comprehensive
and noncomprehensive products. Q2 comprehensive volume increased 11.4% sequentially and 181.9%
year-over-year. In Q2, non-comprehensive volume increased 12.3% sequentially, driven by strength in
Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Go and up 251.7% year-over-year. Q2 adult patients increased 12.6%
sequentially and 220.4% year-over-year. In Q2, teens or younger patients increased 9.5% sequentially
and 156.3% year-over-year. Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange
of approximately $3.4 million or approximately 0.5 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis,
Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $36.7 million or
approximately 12.3 points.

For Q2, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs decreased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis,
Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect higher discounts, credits and foreign exchange, partially offset by
regional mix. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect the increase in net revenue deferrals
for new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments, partially offset by foreign exchange. Recall
Q2 2020 ASPs increased as a result of more additional shipments -- of aligner shipments as doctors were
focused on maintaining treatment progress for existing Invisalign patients. This trend reversed itself after
practices reopened in Q3 and demand for new cases ramped up significantly.

ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Q2 Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and were flat year-over-year. On a
sequential basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs reflect lower discounts, partially offset by foreign
exchange. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by
foreign exchange, offset by higher mix of new Invisalign cases versus additional aligner shipments.

Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $101 million sequentially and $337 million
year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.

Our System and Services revenues for the second quarter were a record $169.8 million, up 20%
sequentially and up 214.7% year-over-year. The increase sequentially and year-over-year can be
attributed to increased scanner shipments, higher ASP and increased services revenue for our larger
installed base. Our Systems and Services revenue -- deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up 22%
sequentially and up 135% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral
of service revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.

Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 75%, down 0.6 points sequentially and up
11.4 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization
of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, overall gross margin was 75.4% for the second quarter,
down 0.7 points sequentially and up 11 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was favorably
impacted by approximately 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange and relatively
unchanged sequentially.

Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 76.9%, down 0.7 points sequentially due to higher
freight costs and slightly lower ASPs. Clear Aligner gross margin was up 12.4 points year-over-year due
to increased manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs.
Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was a record 65.9%, up 0.5 points sequentially,
primarily due to higher ASPs, partially offset by manufacturing variances and higher freight costs. Systems
and Services gross margin was up 6.6 points year-over-year due to higher ASPs and services revenues in
addition to improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes, partially offset by higher
freight costs.

Q2 operating expenses were $489.6 million, up sequentially 8.4% and up 64.7% year-over-year. The
sequential increase in operating expenses is due to increased consumer marketing spend, increased
compensation related to additional head count and higher commissions and other general and
administrative costs. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $192.3 million, reflecting our
continued investment in marketing and sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with
business growth. On a non-GAAP basis, which includes (sic) [ excludes ] stock-based compensation and
amortization of intangibles related to our exocad acquisition, operating expenses were $461.2 million, up
sequentially 8.6% and up 73.6% year-over-year due to the reasons described above.

Our second quarter operating income of $268.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 26.6%, up
1.4 points versus prior quarter and up 47.3 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating
margin was attributed primarily to operational leverage. The year-over-year increase in operating margin
was primarily attributed to higher gross margin and operating leverage as well as a favorable impact
from foreign exchange by approximately 1.8 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based
compensation and amortization of intangibles, operating margin for the second quarter was 29.8%, up 1.2
points sequentially and up 40.8 points year-over-year.

Interest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $0.1 million, down
sequentially by $36.3 million primarily due to the SDC arbitration award gain recorded in the first quarter.

With regards to the second quarter tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 25.7%, which was higher
than the prior quarter rate of 23.4%, primarily due to lower excess tax benefits from stock-based
compensation. Our GAAP tax rate was lower than the same quarter last year, which was 44.8%, primarily
due to foreign income tax at lower rates. The second quarter tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 19.5%
compared to 20.2% in the prior quarter and 27.8% in the prior year. The second quarter non-GAAP tax
rate was lower than the prior quarter and the second quarter of the prior year rates due to foreign income
tax and lower rates.

ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Second quarter net income per diluted share was $2.51, flat sequentially and up $3.03 compared to the
prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $3.04 for the second quarter, up $0.55
sequentially and up $3.39 year-over-year.

Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion, flat
sequentially. Of our $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $551 million was held in the U.S., and
$535.3 million was held by our international entities. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $808.1 million,
up approximately 12.4% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 72 days, flat sequentially
and down approximately 49.1 days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second
quarter was $317.5 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $124.2 million, primarily
related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined
as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $193.3 million. We also have $300
million available under our revolving line of credit. Under our $1 billion repurchase program announced in
May 2021, we have $900 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock.

Now let me turn to our outlook and the factors that inform our view for the remainder of the year. Overall,
we are very pleased with our second quarter results and our continued strong performance across regions,
customer channels and products. While there continues to be uncertainty around the pandemic and
increasing restrictions related to COVID-19 in certain geographies, we are continuing to invest in our
strategic growth initiatives, including sales, marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity, to drive
demand and conversion globally and are confident in our competitive position and ability to execute. At
the same time, we are also anticipating more pronounced summer seasonality across all regions than we
have experienced in recent years as doctors, their staff and patients take long overdue vacations.

Notwithstanding seasonality, given our strong performance and continued confidence in the huge
market opportunity, our industry leadership and our ability to execute, we are increasing our 2021
revenue guidance provided in April on the Q1 '21 earnings call to a range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion.
Additionally, we now expect our second half year-over-year revenue growth rate to be above the midpoint
of our long-term operating model target of 20% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, we now anticipate our 2021
operating margin to be better than our prior guidance in the range of 24% to 25%. On a non-GAAP basis,
we expect the 2021 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin
after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization.

In addition, during Q3 '21, we expect to repurchase up to $75 million of our common stock through either
a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. For 2021, we
expect our investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million. Capital expenditures
primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to
support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in a new manufacturing facility
in Poland, our first one in the EMEA region.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Thanks, John. Q2 was a terrific quarter and we're very pleased with the improvements we've seen in
recovery in doctor practices. We truly value their increasing adoption of digital treatment approaches.
Their confidence in the unique Align Digital Platform that spans from iTero to the world's most
sophisticated treatment planning, the world's largest 3D printing business on the globe to a patient app
worth -- with over -- with 1 million consumers along with the world's most recognized orthodontic brand
has driven strong performance across the business.

Our performance over the last year confirms the incredible size of our target market and demonstrates
that our strategy and investments in recent years have helped further solidify our competitive position.
We have numerous growth drivers in a vastly underpenetrated market. And while we continue to see
some lasting impact and continued uncertainty due to COVID, we remain confident in both the enormous
opportunity we have to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry with our

doctor customers and in our ability to execute our strategy to increase adoption of Invisalign treatment
globally.

We're also confident in and excited about the benefits of digital treatment that more and more doctors
are experiencing by transforming their practices with Invisalign digital orthodontics and iTero scanners
for chairside treatment, planning and visualization. In fact, Invisalign treatment requires, on an average,
30% fewer doctor visits than fixed appliances, creating efficiency gains for the doctors and a better patient
experience. And 85% of orthodontists surveyed agreed that adopting the Align Digital Platform have made
a huge difference in their practices. It provides ways to improve their efficiency and productivity.

I look forward to updating you at the GP Summit and Investor Day in October in Las Vegas and sharing
more examples of how Align is helping doctors transform their practices and their approach to treatment.
Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.

Nathan Allen Rich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Joe, I wanted to start with the increased guidance and expectations around the back half of the year being
at the high end of the long-term range. I guess several of the factors that you highlighted on the call,
the growth in new customers, the strong iTero placements, those have all historically been good leading
indicators of growth in Invisalign. It also sounds like you're seeing better uptake from the DSO channels.
That's obviously an opportunity that you guys have been going after for a long time. So I guess at this
point, does that change how you're thinking about what the right target is for top line growth kind of next
year within the long-term range that you have?

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Nathan, look, I think you cited really well what we're seeing right now, what we're experiencing overall.
And we are calling strong growth for the second half of this year. But look, our revenue guidance is for the
long term -- for the business is 20% to 30%, and we continue to work within those boundaries. So we're
not prepared to change that at the moment. John, any thoughts on your...

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

No. That's exactly -- we feel good about the -- what we're seeing in the marketplace, and our guide
reflects that.

Nathan Allen Rich
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Appreciate that. And then, John, maybe a follow-up for you. Could you maybe go into a little bit more
detail around your comments on the more pronounced summer seasonality? Just how that impacts your
expectations for the sequential growth we're likely to see in 3Q and 4Q of this year maybe versus what
you would expect in a normal year.

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Well, as we know, I mean there's summer period where people take vacations, holidays and so on in EMEA
and other places, and we expect -- and I think what we see in our own lives is you take longer weekends
or maybe more pronounced vacations, people doing things in advance of shutdowns or lockdowns that
might happen. And I think we're just being reflective of that but really looking at all the variables that
we normally see. And talking to the -- what we expect for the second half, which is to the upper point or
upper side of our midpoint on a year-over-year basis.

Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.

Jonathan David Block
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I think Joe, I'll start with you with the first one. The -- I think it was 5.3 North American GP utilization
number -- was huge. And I think we all waited for a while to get that -- to get to 4. Now it's worth a
5. Just talk to us on what that is. I mean I'm assuming it's what -- it's more scanners. Is it also just

increased utilization with even those that have had the scanner for some time? Would love some color. And
maybe just more importantly, is that 5 handle on the North American GP utilization, do you view that as
sustainable going forward? And then I've got a follow-up.

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Jon, I consider everything we do has more than a single variable to it, and that's the platform that we
work with, which you know as well as anybody. But I'd say, yes, scanners serve that very well. Our
increased advertising helps to drive that, too. It brings more patients to the GPs. And thirdly, new
products like what we're working, iGO and different derivatives of that product line that are very efficient
for GPs to use, and it gives them a huge amount of confidence in our product line when they use it, Jon.
So it's a combination of our brand. It's a combination of a digital platform with iTero. It's a combination of
product piece.

And then we don't talk about it a lot, but we split our sales force years ago. And we have a specific
focused sales force on GPs. And being a GP speak a different language, Jon. It's different than
orthodontists altogether. And that team has been incredibly effective in being able to work with doctors,
how they can integrate Invisalign into their workflow and, from a restorative standpoint, how you use this
proactively. So we're -- I'm confident. That's a great market for us. We know that 500 million patients we
talk about globally sits broadly in that segment and -- but you need a different kind of a product approach,
a different sales approach and a strong platform geared to those guys to keep that going. And we feel
good about that.

Jonathan David Block
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. And actually, you brought up an interesting point. I think that the sales force, I believe, bifurcated
international more recently in North America. So I guess we're starting to see that come through.

Second question, John, just let me try to be as detailed as possible. So you've got solid 2Q '21 sales
upside that you just reported. Then you raised the back part of the year from roughly 25% year-over-year
revenue midpoint growth to closer to 27%. Yet you call out some more pronounced summer seasonality.
And those seem at odds with one another. So can you just reconcile those 2 data points? In other words,
you're alluding to more seasonality. Yet you just took up the forecast in the back part of the year even in
the face of that. So any color would be great.

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

I think it really reflects just the timing between quarters and not kind of as you said, looking at the second
half in a way, not knowing how vacations and holidays and lockdowns' potential might play out, but
looking at it in totality and kind of looking at it from a second half standpoint.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler.

Jason M. Bednar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Joe, I wanted to follow up on Nathan's question there, going back to the first one. Maybe if you can
unpack a bit further what you're seeing here as we look ahead in the next couple of quarters, especially
now that we've lapped the easiest of your comps. Your guide here would suggest the momentum is strong
across the business. But the key question I keep getting from investors is really how that adult consumer
in the second half of the year and then into '22, how they're going to respond. So the question, I guess,
for you is just how you're seeing the adult consumer respond in your various geographies as economies
have opened back up and as we start staring down some tougher comps in the adult side? And I've got a
follow-up.

ALIGN TECHNOLOGY, INC. FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 28, 2021

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Well, I think Jason, in what we see with adults, and we see this really all over the globe, is we obviously
had a big uptake from an adult standpoint. But you can see our teen numbers up pretty substantially, too,
at the same time. So it's a good balance. The previous question that Jon asked, too, with GPs, it comes
in -- broadly in adult segment, in that segment also. And my explanation in the sense of why we've been
effective in that segment, we think we can continue to be -- helps to contribute to that.

Now when we talk about third quarter and seasonality or John talking about whatever, a lot of that
is around adult patients and vacations and different things, too, and it affects different parts of the
organization, but -- and how we go to market. But in general, we just feel good about the direction of the
business, the signal and words that we're getting from our doctors and what they're explaining they're
seeing out there. And that's all incorporated into what we've been forecasting for you.

The one thing to never forget about, too, Jason is the size of this marketplace. We talk about 500 million
patients, and I know you hear from a lot of other companies in different industries about oversized sims
and whatever. This is true. If anything's sort of shown -- like I mentioned in my closing comments that
this market is as big as we talked about being as what you've seen from this business over the last year
and in the adult segment of that part, too, which is a big part of that 500 million patients that we talked
about.

Jason M. Bednar
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

All right. That's helpful, Joe. And then just looking at least relative to our model in the quarter, it looks like
most of the outperformance or disproportionate amount came from the Americas. I'm sure that's U.S.,
but also maybe Brazil, and you've made some pretty strong comments in the past on what Brazil could
do for your business in a pretty short window of time. So just wondered if you could update us here on
where you're at with expansion in Brazil. Maybe how much of that market in particular is contributing to
sequential case growth.

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes, no statistics for it. Brazil continues to be strong. I think you know it's a big aesthetic market. It's one
of the biggest aesthetics markets in the world. It parallels Iberia in a lot of ways as we -- how we have
to go in there and move. We're primarily in the orthodontic segment there, not in the GP segment right
now and how we have done it. And it's a different market that way because orthos play in a much more
broader sense in that country than what we do here. But we have a very experienced team there. We
funded it well. I feel good about our position from a product standpoint and iTero scanners. And it's a big
market for us. And don't just think about Brazil, too. Latin America, in general, it's been a big expanding
market for us. So Brazil leads because of the size of population and aesthetics we talked about. But
overall, our Lat Am market is extremely strong, and we're well positioned there. John, any thoughts on
that?

Erin Wright

Okay. Great. Sticking with that international topic, can you speak to the growth in the quarter in Asia Pac
and what you're seeing across that market? Are you still seeing some COVID-related lingering headwinds
there? And can you speak to some of the competitive landscape dynamics as well and then also your
efforts in terms of expanding the consumer advertising effort across that geography as well?

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Erin, this is John. I can address the start of that. Look, APAC is an important region for us, a huge market
opportunity. We've invested, as we've talked about, with manufacturing and treatment plan in other
places. We recently have added some advertising -- additional advertising in APAC, and we see great
results where there's a lot of interest, a lot of awareness that it drives. People come to our website and
look for doctors and so on. And we think that translates very well. We're very happy with the quarter for
Q2. You have -- you do have pockets of areas where there's COVID -- more of a COVID impact, Southeast
Asia, parts of China, other areas that we're always mindful of. But when we look at the investments we're
making, the return that we're getting from those investments, we feel really good about APAC.

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

Erin Wright

Okay. And then how should we be thinking about the quarterly progression of the gross margin from here
and the run rate going forward? Is this -- is there anything to call out in terms of mix or ASPs or some of
those seasonal dynamics you were talking about that we should be thinking about as we think about the
third and the fourth quarter gross margin trend?

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Nothing of major note, Erin. I mean we've seen that as we drive utilization, have more coming through
our factories, very productive for us, we're very mindful of the trade-offs that affect our margin, and
you're seeing that come through. So as we look at some of the investments that we're making and how
we're going to market, products that we have, how we view things, there's nothing that should be too
different than what we've seen from a gross margin standpoint.

Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird & Co.

Jeffrey D. Johnson
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

A couple of questions here, I guess. One, on the seasonality -- and again, I hate to keep harping on
that. But typically, by this point, late July, you guys now know July numbers. You probably know pretty
much what's lined up for August given cases that are in treatment planning phase right now. So are the
seasonality comments driven by something you're seeing so far in the numbers? Is it something that
you're just expecting could come in late in the quarter? Is it focused on the adult side? Just kind of any
more color there would be helpful as well.

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Jeff, it's just -- it's based on our experience with the season. I think you know. You've been following our
business long enough. Third quarter is a real transition quarter, from a vacation standpoint, teens coming
in here, European vacations, which are really big. And our comments is just reflecting what we're hearing
from our customer base, our doctor bases not just in the United States but all over the world, and we're

just trying to share that with you. But at the same time, the guidance that we've taken up, you have to
remember we're at the upper end of our growth modeling for the second half. And when you think about
it, we had 2 real strong quarters last year, Jeff, third and fourth quarter. So it shows a lot of confidence in
what we see and what we feel.

Jeffrey D. Johnson
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Yes. Understood. And then on ASPs, John, maybe for you, it sounds like some of the rebating or some of
the promotional activity, I guess I should say, maybe has stepped down just a little bit. Obviously, you're
running some bigger trade-in programs in that late last year and the early part of this year. Is that an
opportunity then for ASPs to float a little bit higher into the back half of next year? Or does -- do other
promotions pop up and just think about ASPs kind of straight-lining from here?

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Yes. I would say the latter. I mean, look, there's always promotions that we're running to drive that right
utilization and you try to find that right mix. And what we talk about and I think everybody gets is it has
to translate to gross margin, and we feel good about the gross margin that is ultimately driving -- and our
op margin that it brings to our bottom line. So there'll be some trade-offs, but I don't expect too much of
a change in ASP. And the way we've looked at it -- and just because some grow faster than others, you
look at it from a comprehensive standpoint versus a non-comprehensive standpoint to be relatively stable.

Operator

Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.

John Charles Kreger
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Maybe just one more follow-up. I would assume the seasonality comment is mainly sort of one about
adults, but curious if you've got any thoughts on how the teen season might differ this year. Is it shaping
up to be sort of a normal year as we assume schools are open again or maybe more spread evenly across
the second half?

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

I think you look at it, John, just from the standpoint that there are unknowns around COVID and vacations
and other things. COVID is one of them. Some places -- we hear some of the countries and regions,
schools going to open up earlier. Some are saying that it's later. So we're just trying to be mindful
that there's going to be changes that happen to this and try to give as much information about that as
possible.

John Charles Kreger
William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division

Great. And then maybe one follow-up on ASP. It seemed like the year-over-year trend was different
in comprehensive versus non-comprehensive. Could you just explain that again? Why would that
comprehensive change have been greater than a non-comprehensive? And when you think about that
metric longer term, do you assume the trajectory is similar across those 2 buckets or not?

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Yes. The biggest change from last year to this year is really around the additional treatment that doctors
were providing. So remember, last year, they didn't have as many new patients coming in, but they were
still keeping existing patients along in treatment. And it doesn't count as a new case. It really just counts
as additional revenue. And therefore, ASPs are higher as a result of that. Conversely, as now they focus

more on primary cases and new patients coming in, we see that shift. We saw that shift really started in
the third quarter of last year. It's kind of been -- progressed relatively steady from third quarter on. And
that's kind of how we think of it. There's not a -- it's not a promotional change or there's nothing of that
nature. It's really more just on how we're recognizing revenue between a primary shipment and then an
additional treatment that a doctor provides.

Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.

Elizabeth Hammell Anderson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

So my question is in terms of the second quarter, could you talk about how you saw volumes progressing
maybe in the U.S. across the 3 months?

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

I think when we look at it -- Elizabeth, this is John. We saw strength across our business. We're not going
to get into kind of month by month, but I think what we saw and you saw in the print for the second
quarter, very strong across geographies, products and so on. And what we're seeing is a reflection of that
with our guidance.

Elizabeth Hammell Anderson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. That makes sense. And then turning to the cash flow, I appreciate the CapEx increase this year
is largely a function of the new facility in Poland. Is that something that should continue on at that kind
of pace going forward? Or do you see kind of all of that wrapped up in this year's expense and then we
should go back to sort of more normalized levels afterwards?

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Yes. I think what you'll see with kind of the convergence of what we have now, we have a lot of capacity
that we're adding to meet the demand in the markets that we have. And we have that unique event with
Poland kind of going on from the land purchase, building and equipment that goes in. So this year will be
a little bit heavy from that standpoint. And then going forward, it should just be more about the expansion
and growth that way but not as much as this year with the building as well.

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Elizabeth, this is Joe. When you're thinking about -- we're talking about 200% growth rates, right? And
now here, we're talking about growth rates on the upper end of what our revenue models -- we've given
to you guys. So it requires capacity and that kind of investment and -- it's a good question. But like John
said, we hit it hard this year, built some more capacity, and this will lay in over time.

Elizabeth Cristina Mari Garcia
Wolfe Research, LLC

So I guess just digging into kind of how you're thinking about the exocad expansion with the Ivoclar
Vivadent and kind of how you see the opportunity building there, you've mentioned a couple of things. But
also, should we view this kind of as like a first move for exocad and going forward, the strategy into more
CAD/CAM?

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Liza, it's a good question, right? When you think about -- we talk about the GP segment. We talk
about ortho-restorative. And I think most people, if you study this -- that exocad is one of the few
companies out there that actually offers a digital type of restorative platform for dentists all around the
world. Our vision for our business is we become a big part of restorative in saving enamel and moving
teeth. Before you actually do implants, you need to do different things. And that's what -- that, we think,
is the revolution of orthodontics because that wasn't a tool that was really used before. And so exocad and
iTero plug in really well behind that.

Never forget that our strategy is always about selling more Invisalign. That's what exocad is about. That's
what iTero is about, too. But they also have to have credibility as units in those segments. And that's when
we talk about what we're doing with exocad and iTero. We're expanding that technology but always with
the thought of how we can be more effective in ortho-restorative. John actually runs the business so I'll let
him [ talk about that ].

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

No, I think you summarized it well. I mean this is a -- it's been just over a year. We're very pleased with
how the business stands -- as it stands alone and then the technical and commercial integration that's
been going on. And we see more and more synergies and feel good about the digital platform that this
helps us move forward. So more to come on this, but after a year, we're very pleased.

Elizabeth Cristina Mari Garcia
Wolfe Research, LLC

Great. Awesome. And then I was just wondering if you're hearing any indications from your customers
about staffing as a potential issue that's kind of limiting their availability anywhere. It doesn't -- obviously,
the report doesn't certainly seem that way, but channel checks have kind of indicated some more limited
staffing.

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Liza, it's Joe again. I think -- I wouldn't call it a hindrance right now. They have to pay more to find
these people. There is concern out there in the sense of how much people have to pay to bring them in,
but we haven't had that as an excuse of doctors saying, "I can't do more cases because I can't find staff."
It's just harder to spend more time doing it.

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

The one thing that you do here, and it's just the reality when we talk about some of that seasonality,
people take vacations. There's doctors on vacation as well as staff and patients. So they might fall into
that bucket as well to limit some of that staff at their offices.

Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.

Jaime Lynn Morgan
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

It's Jaime on for Rich. A quick question from me. On teens, obviously, our checks, specifically within the
ortho channel, have been very bullish over the last couple of months. And now with it representing greater
than 1/3 of total case shift, is it fair to say now that teen adoption is finally hitting that inflection point in
the U.S.? And if not, kind of what are some of the things that you think still need to happen to really start
to take on this sort of viewpoint?

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

It's Joe. Look, this is not a tipping point, as you referred to it. This is -- it's been a ground war actually.
And that ground war has basically started with product liability. And obviously, with Invisalign First and
mandibular advancement and some of our other innovations that we've had, we've really opened up that
segment and made it available to us, too. Now the work is primarily with orthodontists to make them
confident that they can service these teens, not just clinically, but from a business standpoint also. That's
why our programs like ADAPT and different things, we put it in place.

And remember, if -- the war here is not against other clear aligner companies. It's about braces and fixed
appliances. And that's what we really have to break through and get done. And honestly, orthodontists
just have to be comfortable not clinically but also from a business standpoint. And I feel like we're making
progress in educating teens and educating moms but on the other hand, educating orthodontists to how
they can properly do this clinically and also be efficient in their practices in doing it. And that's the ground
war part. I feel we're well positioned. And obviously, our numbers say we're making progress. But there is
-- we're not declaring victory here at all.

Jaime Lynn Morgan
SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just one follow-up back to kind of some of the more pronounced summer seasonality. If
I look back kind of through 2017 through 2019, it seems like you guys have seen anywhere from flat to
maybe mid-single-digit sequential improvement. Consensus is currently standing at something that would
imply a decline. So is there any reason to be thinking that it shouldn't at least fall within the bounds of 0
-- a flat to mid-single-digit improvement versus what consensus is currently implying, which would be a
decline? Just trying to get a better calibration there.

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Yes. Jaime, this is John. Look, we're trying to give you color to the second half kind of because it's implied
in our total year, and you can kind of differ what -- kind of infer what that means from third quarter and
fourth quarter. But just trying to give you as much color without giving quarterly guidance is all that, that

margin, especially on non-GAAP side. You had another really good quarter there, and you bumped the
guide a little bit, but you're still sort of -- your outlook for the second half still implies a pretty decent step
down in operating margins. I'm just wondering what's going on there. Is there any incremental spend that

you're budgeting? And just in general, sort of expand on that. Could you talk a little bit about consumer
marketing spend? How are those costs trending? How is the return on that going?

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Yes. It's a good question. I mean look, we're very pleased with our op margin that we've seen through
the first half. As you noted, it's a very strong performance, a reflection of a lot of the investments that we
made and we continue to make to help grow our business. And we look at the second half as continuing
these investments to expand from a sales and marketing standpoint. There are some -- these operating
costs that we have to be able to grow our business like we have. It reflects those investments, and we're
trying to continue to position ourselves so that we continue momentum and be able to start next year with
that momentum. So it's really more of a reflection of that. And obviously, as we go through the second
half, we'll update on what that means for margin.

Michael Leonidovich Ryskin
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And then on the gross margin line, again, just on the -- you got the manufacturing facility in China.
You're talking about the plant in Poland up in 2022. Could you give us an update, a reminder of sort of
how we should think about progression there in terms of shifting some of the manufacturing in there and
how that should work its way through the gross margin line? Sort of when do those plants reach more or
less full capacity and sort of your work through the ramp-up there?

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Yes. You're right. When we go live, there is -- until you get that capacity up -- and we're really -- we know
how to do that manufacturing. We've learned as we've gone through some of the China facility ramp-up.
That will get applied to how we ramp up in Poland. We'll move doctors over kind of country by country and
ramp things up. That will happen in the first half of next year, but very mindful of what it means from a
margin standpoint and do everything we can to minimize that inefficiency that you have when you first
start up and be able to get those facilities up and running at near 100% capacity.

Joseph M. Hogan
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And one of the things that John knows better than me on this one, Michael, is when we ramped up
China, remember, we started with a rental, temporary facility that was not even close to scale, and it just
pounded our cost. But we just wanted to get in place, get the workflow done. We built a building next to
where that area was then transitioned into it. So that was a pretty big bump that we took there. We're not
anticipating, John, like the same.

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Right. And that would happen, Michael, when -- we kind of quietly went live in Q2 of last year for that new
greenfield facility. And it's all about running that factory with a high utilization, have an efficient labor and
kind of productivity there that we know how to drive. But there is some ramp-up period, but we'll look to
that in kind of the first half and then see improvement as we go into the second half.

checks with orthos at least is that SmartTrack gives you an edge. Just curious on your view and whether
that's kind of starting to have any sort of impact or is it too early and then how you plan to maybe position
yourself to kind of keep ahead of the peers.

And then secondly, just around China, I guess it's another kind of competition question with, I guess, your
largest but still relatively small competitor going public. How are you kind of viewing that market now with
kind of another, I guess, well-funded competitor out there in terms of the ability to grow the market or
kind of go after a potential segment of that market, whether it's the more luxury-focused patients? Or how
are you kind of segmenting the population there?

Ravi, on your first question on the new polymer, remember, we do multilayer materials. So it's various
polymers that you put together, and we're balancing the equation between elasticity and overall rigidity or
tensile strength. And it's like our other competitors are starting to figure that piece out and see pieces of
it. We have strong patents around SmartTrack and obviously improvement over time. It's a real important
part about not just having the right materials but having the right kind of system in place, and that's a
treatment planning part that we talked about, 25 years of understanding how to really activate those
aligners and make that plastic actually work through those algorithms. And we don't use the displacement
methodology, which is basically building wire that kind of leads things. It actually engages with these
things in a different way.

So I expect more companies to come out and work different polymers or whatever. We have a huge
amount of experience to that, but don't forget about the entire system, the algorithms, how it works
together and how it works with attachments, the exactness of those attachments, where you put those
attachments, how they're shaped. There's a lot going on there. We feel good about our position, and
we'll continue to innovate in that space across all those spectrums. But there's nothing in the competitive
marketplace that we are concerned with that would change the trajectory of where we're investing right
now.

From a China competitive standpoint, obviously, Angelalign IPO, we watch that closely. And it gives some
clarity to everybody in that marketplace as they IPO-ed and what's going on. And I think you see they're
strong in Tier 3 cities. They're strong with public hospitals in different areas and -- but look, we -- I feel
good about our position in China. Our manufacturing is strong. Our training centers there are strong.
Our treatment planning is strong. It's close to accounts. We had good growth in the quarter overall, good
sequential growth, good year-on-year growth. I like our position there. John, anything?

John F. Morici
CFO & Senior VP of Global Finance

Yes. I mean just to add, in China, we've been competing in China with various companies since we've
been there. So it's nothing new really with the IPO. It's really more of a reflection of this under-penetrated
market in China. China is a huge opportunity for Clear Aligner business. And so we feel very good about
our positioning there. Primarily, cases are done with wires and brackets. And so this is less about share
shifting amongst clear aligner and more about growth in the category.

Shirley Stacy
Vice President of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations

Thanks, Ravi. Yes. Well, listen, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We really appreciate your time.
We look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, including
the International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany, September 22 through 25, where we'll be showcasing
Align, exocad innovations and a hybrid and multimedia exhibition space through physical and virtual
