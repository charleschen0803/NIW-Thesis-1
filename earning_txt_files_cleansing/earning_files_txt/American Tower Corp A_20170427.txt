Okay, thanks, Leah
Good morning, everyone
As Leah just highlighted, we generated another quarter of strong results posting double digit growth across our key metrics
In addition, our Consolidated Organic Tenant Billings Growth accelerated to 8.6%
We continued to delever naturally to 4.6 times net debt to its annualized adjusted EBITDA
We grew our common stock dividend by about 22% and with the resumption of our share purchase program during the quarter, we bought back more than $400 million of our stock so far this year
We also closed on our acquisition in France, which enabled us to launch operations in our 15th global market and built over 460 new sites globally
With that, let's dive into the details around our first quarter performance and updated outlook for the year
If you'll please turn to slide six, consolidated property revenue grew by nearly 26% in the first quarter, including Tenant Billings Growth of about 22% and Organic Tenant Billings Growth of 8.6%
Property segment revenue growth for the quarter was about 5% including Organic Tenant Billings Growth of 6.5% representing a 70 basis point sequential acceleration from the fourth quarter of 2016. This strong growth reflects a healthy demand environment, which drove our third consecutive quarter of record new business levels and the cash impact of our recently signed MLA amendment
Volume growth from colocations and amendments contributed just over 5% and pricing escalators just over 3%
This was partially offset by churn of around 2% on an annualized basis, just 40 basis points of which was associated with operational churn from the big four core networks
International Organic Tenant Billings Growth was over 14% on a consolidated basis, with all three international segments growing double digits
This growth was supported by the significant geographic technological and tenant diversification embedded in our global portfolio as well as positive secular global trends in wireless, including rising smartphone penetration
Contractual pricing escalators, driven primarily by local CPI indexes in most international markets, contributed nearly 7% to our growth while volumes from colocations and amendments drove an even greater contribution at over 9%
Other run rate items contributed an additional 60 basis points and this was partially offset by churn from about 2.4% primarily resulting from continued carrier consolidation in India
On the inorganic side, the day one revenue associated with the over 46,000 sites we added since the first quarter of 2016, including the Viom portfolio and our new French and Argentinean assets contributed another 13% to our Global Tenant Billings Growth
Our new build program also remained active and we constructed over 460 sites globally this quarter, predominantly in our international markets where average day one NOI yields were nearly 12%
And as you can see on slide seven, our strong revenue trends led to double digit growth in both adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO for the 16th consecutive quarter with both metrics growing nearly 20%
Growth on a per share basis was similarly strong with consolidated AFFO per share and AFFO attributable to common stockholders per share growing over 19% and over 15% respectfully (sic) [respectively] (06:59)
Turning to slide eight, let's now take a look at our updated expectations for 2017. At the midpoint of our revised full-year outlook, we expect property revenue to grow by nearly 14% to over $6.5 billion
This represents an increase of about $105 million or 1.6% from the updated outlook we reported in the 8-K issued at the end of last month
This increase reflects about $27 million in additional straight-line revenue, about $20 million of which is attributable to incremental straight-line revenue from the MLA amendment we announced in the 8-K
We also have included a couple million dollars of incremental U.S
straight-line revenue as a result of normal course extensions and around $5 million or so of incremental straight-line revenue internationally, primarily from our newly acquired business in France
Additionally, we've layered in about $73 million from positive foreign-exchange rate fluctuations relative to our prior outlook as a result of year-to-date FX actuals and our refreshed outlook rates for the balance of the year
The rest of the increase is attributable to slightly higher pass-through revenue and some slight out-performance in tenant revenue in the U.S
, EMEA and Latin America
We expect this to be partially offset by our lower revenue expectations in India due to higher churn
We continue to expect strong organic growth in 2017 in both our U.S
and international businesses with Consolidated Organic Tenant Billings Growth in the 7% to 8% range supported by our global scale and increasing diversification
These expectations are supported by our new business pipeline, our expectation that the positive demand trends underlying our first quarter results will continue for the remainder of 2017, and the meaningful contractual new business secured by the MLA amendment we signed in Q1. Given our strong Q1 results and indications of continued network investment by our U.S
tenants, we are raising our expectations modestly for U.S
Organic Tenant Billings Growth to over 6% for the year
This reflects the expectation that 2017 U.S
colocation and amendment activity will be up over 15% versus 2016. I would also like to make clear that we have still not included any meaningful leasing expectations from the completed incentive auction nor any potential impact from FirstNet deployments in our current outlook
We are optimistic about the intermediate and long-term organic growth potential of our U.S
business
In the intermediate term, aside from potential catalysts such as the 600-megahertz deployment, we expect our tenants to increasingly rely on densifying their networks to support rising mobile data usage, given most available spectrum assets have already been auctioned and given spectral efficiency within 4G is already very high
Looking even further out, the Internet of Things and other emerging technologies may very well provide additional upside for our U.S
Tower business
We have cultivated a high-quality U.S
asset base with significant incremental capacity and strategically important locations that we believe will enable us to be an important part of the solution for both this broadcast spectrum deployment and repack process as well as for other near-term carrier deployment initiatives
Over the last several years, we worked diligently to specifically augment our portfolio to help meet the needs of these important opportunities
We significantly enhanced our suburban and rural offerings through the Verizon Wireless tower transaction, and we cemented our position as the largest independent broadcast tower owner in the country through the strategic broadcast tower acquisitions we've made over the last several years
We expect this differentiated portfolio of assets will enhance our organic U.S
growth, given that they are in locations particularly well suited to serve these pending initiatives
In our international markets, we're now projecting Organic Tenant Billings Growth of between 9% and 10%, down slightly from the approximately 10% we had layered into our prior outlook
Additionally, as we have stated previously, we expect our international organic tenant billings rate to decline sequentially throughout the year, largely as a result of the calculation methodology, as Viom moves into the beginning run rate starting in the second quarter
Our underlying international business continues to be strong, supported by our increasing global diversification, and as a result, we're actually raising our expectations for the contribution for gross commenced new business by nearly 1% from our prior outlook
We do, however, expect this increase to be offset by higher assumed churn levels
Churn is now estimated to be in the low-3% range internationally for the year, versus 2.3% in the prior outlook
This incremental churn is attributable to updated expectations regarding the ongoing carrier consolidation and market rationalization process in India, which is proceeding at a slightly faster pace than we had previously anticipated
While it creates a near-term headwind, we view the consolidation process as a long-term structural positive for the market, and in the future, we expect stronger, well capitalized tenants to support an industry where wireless competition can be incrementally more rational
This scenario may be further enhanced by the increasing presence of independent stakeholders in some of the captive tower companies in the marketplace
Additionally, I would note that our revised outlook actually includes an increase of about 2% in the expected contribution from new business commencements in India, signaling continued underlying strong demand for tower space in the market as new network technologies are rolled out
So to summarize, we expect another year of solid international Organic Tenant Billings Growth as a result of increased levels of colocation and amendment activity in our international markets, despite lower CPI-based escalators and some increased churn assumptions in India
We're also raising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA, consolidated AFFO, and consolidated AFFO per share
We're raising our expectations for adjusted EBITDA by about $70 million, or 1.8%, which reflects about $42 million from positive foreign exchange rate fluctuations and about $26 million from the benefit of net straight line recognition
Additionally, we now expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue of about 7.7%, a decline of around 20 basis points from the prior year
We expect this increase in adjusted EBITDA to translate into higher consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share as well
We're raising our outlook for consolidated AFFO by $55 million, or about 2%, and now expect to generate consolidated AFFO of over $2.8 billion for the year
We're also raising our expectations for consolidated AFFO per share by 2%, and now expect to generate over $6.50 of consolidated AFFO per share at the midpoint of our outlook
Turning to slide nine, we deployed approximately $1.2 billion of capital in first quarter, including over $500 million for acquisitions and $225 million of stock repurchases
We spent over $150 million for discretionary CapEx to build new sites, enhance the capacity of existing sites, strategically invest in land, and to bring newly acquired sites up to AMT standards with startup CapEx
We also spent about $24 million on nondiscretionary maintenance and corporate CapEx, representing less than 1.5% of our consolidated revenues for the period
In addition, we declared about $291 million in common and preferred dividends in the quarter, growing our common stock dividend by around 22%
All the while we continue to delever, and ended the quarter at a last quarter annualized net leverage ratio of 4.6 times
Subsequent to the quarter end, through April 26, we've continued to buy back shares, bringing our year-to-date purchases to over $400 million
The strength of our capital deployment strategy continues to be evidenced by our strong track record of growth across our key financial metrics, as well as a rising return on invested capital across our business
In both our U.S
and international operations, ROIC expanded in Q1. Our U.S
ROIC increased about 0.6% year-over-year to 11.3%, despite the non-recurrence of $31 million in decommissioning revenue from the first quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, our international ROIC rose to 10.1%, primarily driven by continuing solid organic new business growth
This performance is especially encouraging in light of the fact that our International ROIC includes the impact of over 46,000 newer, lower initial margin sites not included in the prior year comparison
As a result, our consolidated return on invested capital expanded to 10.5% in the quarter, up over 40 basis points year-over-year
This reflects our strong Q1 results, the benefit of increased net straight line recognition for amended MLA, as well as seasonally low maintenance CapEx and cash taxes
For the full year, even without the benefit of this seasonal favorability, we expect consolidated ROIC to be above 10%
As you can see on slide 10, our capacity for discretionary capital allocation continues to grow, and we expect to use that capacity to help us drive compelling total returns for our stockholders
Given the more than $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA at midpoint of our outlook, we now anticipate having about $1.5 billion in incremental borrowing capacity for the year, which is about $600 million higher than our initial outlook
Since our expectations for our common stock dividend and CapEx program remain unchanged, we expect the vast majority of this incremental capacity to flow through to our discretionary capital allocation
About $125 million of that total has been earmarked for our entrance into Paraguay, with more than $400 million having been spent for share repurchases year-to-date
That still leaves us with over $1.1 billion available to allocate at our discretion between additional acquisitions and share repurchases
Turning to slide 11, and in summary, we extended our track record of delivering double-digit growth across our key financial metrics in the first quarter, highlighted by our 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO
At the same time, we continued to delever while growing our common stock dividend by 22% and simultaneously purchased over $400 million worth of shares, year to date, under our buyback program
Our strong first quarter results coupled with a backdrop of expected continued positive global demand and incrementally more favorable FX rates have enabled us to meaningfully raise our outlook for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share
In addition, due to the growth in the business, we have a sizable amount of incremental borrowing capacity which could be deployed to generate incremental value
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim
Yeah, Colby, I can take – the last one is easy
From an FX perspective, if the spot rates stay for the rest of the year, the math works out to be an incremental $66 million of property revenue, $31 million of adjusted EBITDA, and $22 million of consolidated AFFO
Actually, we'd expect the colos and amendments to be pretty consistent from a dollar perspective throughout the year, as well as, obviously, escalations
So we're looking at the overall
No, I would expect, on a full-year basis, 2016 versus 2017 on a colo and amendment basis, to be up probably – it's over 15%, I think, is what we had actually said
Yeah, but it's going to be pretty consistent
Maybe down $1 million for the next Q2, Q3, Q4, but at least based upon what we see right now, and to the extent that we see something differently next quarter, we'll update our outlook at that point in time
And by the way, if you go back and take a look at I think the supplemental, you'll see that we actually had quite a strong Q3 and Q4 of last year as well
So we had a rising growth coming into the end of last year, which gave us more confidence even in terms of looking at 2017. So I think that's how you get the math to work
Yeah, I mean, historically, I think it's a good benchmark for the future
I mean, both in our U.S
as well as in international we look to the churn being, on an annual basis, in that 1% to 2% range
So I think what we're seeing in some of the international markets, particularly as we talked about in India, is a slightly higher rate of churn due to this consolidation that's going on in the market which we think at the back end is going to prove to be a much stronger market from a wireless perspective
And I would expect the churn, the higher elevated churn in India probably to exist for the next several quarters, probably into 2018. But I would expect overall then going forward the international churn to be back down into that 1% to 2% range
Yeah, thanks, Batya
I think in terms of – it obviously varies by carrier, but given kind of the 4G deployments that we're having, we're still largely amendment driven in the market which differs slightly from some of our international markets which are driving colo which is really just driving new coverage
So, I would expect us to continue to be overall largely weighted to amendment activity
But as I said, it varies by carrier
From the escalator perspective, it's pretty consistent I think throughout the year
I would expect for the year it to be in that 3.1% area, just north of the 3% which is really where we landed in Q1. So it's quite consistent throughout the year
And, again, it's somewhat predictable because 95% of our contracts are actually fixed rate in the United States
So I would expect consistency throughout the year
Amir, our playbook for capital allocation has been the same for the last ten years, and it's really where can we allocate the capital to drive the highest NPV and the highest value
And so we have development teams around the globe looking at every opportunity that's out there, and there is a pipeline of activity in every market that we're doing business in
And we'll continue to evaluate and to the extent that we can drive higher value from those types of things versus a buyback, we'll continue to do it
You see we just announced another transaction in South America which fits nicely within our total portfolio
My sense is that there'll be a lot of little carve-ins like that type of a transaction
I've mentioned this before, but we own less than a third of all the inventory in the markets that we're doing business in
So our focus would be continually to look at the markets that we're in and look at the opportunities for M&A in those markets
And to the extent that it makes sense for us and exceeds, obviously, our risk adjusted cost of capital and we think that we can get better NPV there than buying back a share at this point in time, we'll move down that path
So there really are several legs to the capital allocation pool, but we're looking to do both, just as we did in the first quarter
Year to date we've bought over $400 million of shares but we did close on the transaction in France, and as I mentioned, just announced this other transaction in Latin America
So we're doing all of these things at once, and we'll continue to look at transactions in that light
No, I think that's a very reasonable expectation that we should see in that market over the next several years
We expect at the end of this year, we'll be actually merging our existing legacy business into the Viom business
We would expect even synergy opportunities there going forward
And as we continue to lease up in the market, we'll continually, just as every other model that we have around the world, continually see opportunities
We think now with the 50,000 plus sites that we've got in the marketplace, we've got that type of scale in the market that we think is important from a carrier perspective
So I think you're thinking about our future in that market exactly as we're thinking about it, and the reasons that we're so excited about the opportunity
Well, let me clarify
I think you're going to see the – because it's higher level of churn as a result of this consolidation, into 2018. So we would expect to see this for probably the next 12 to 24 months
Really, just as you said, because of the industry consolidation going on and the network deployments, we should see this higher level of churn
But what I mentioned in my remarks, what we're very excited about seeing is, we're also seeing a much higher level of colocation and amendment activity going into the marketplace
And so I think, kind of to your first point, given the demand that we see in the marketplace, it really is driving the growth in the market, given kind of the amount of capital that the carriers are putting in
But we'll see the churn probably for the next 12, 24 months in the market
Okay
It's really hard to isolate at any one specific time
But given the long-term holistic agreements we enter into are supported by all three assets, the demand from our customers, really over the last several years has been more heavily weighted towards amendments, as we mentioned before
And as a result of the technology and spectrum upgrades, our customers really have been investing across the entire footprint
The legacy ATC and GTP portfolios have certainly benefited, given their high existing tenancy compared to the Verizon portfolio
So I'd say that, over the last three years, our legacy ATC portfolio has grown right in line with the average of our U.S
And the GTP portfolio has probably grown slightly more than our legacy base
And regarding the Verizon's portfolio lower existing tenancy and the demand (53:00) for amendments, the Verizon portfolio has grown a bit slower than our legacy base
Just this year, we have certainly seen an uptick in demand for new tenancy or collocation, which we expect will be heavily weighted to our Verizon portfolio
So I think, as Jim alluded to, we believe that the macro towers are positioned to see further increase in demand for those increased tenancies, as the next layer of densification occurs across the suburban and rural markets
And I think the Verizon portfolio is really well positioned to gain strong demand during that period of time
Yeah, David, on your second question, there will be now – it's just math in terms of including the Viom base into the calculation for organic growth going into the second quarter
And so that's kind of that natural stepdown that I know you're very familiar with
But when you take a look at kind of our legacy India business which I think was what the question was, we've been looking at kind of double digit growth rates and organic growth in those particular markets
And so as I said on a consolidated basis, we're probably looking in India in the 7% range in terms of total growth going forward for the year
And, again, that's versus the high growth rate that we saw in the first quarter
And a good piece of that is a function of the math (58:57) stepdown
But also in anticipation of some of that accelerated churn that I talked about in the business going forward
Really, we'll start to see that I think more broadly in the second half of the year
And Mike, on your other question, just in terms of average remaining lease term
On a consolidated basis, average remaining lease term at the end of Q1 is 5.6 years and that's been very consistent for the last several quarters
In the U.S
, it's 5.7 years, which again, very consistent, and obviously varies by market, but in that five to six years remaining on a consolidated basis
Sure
