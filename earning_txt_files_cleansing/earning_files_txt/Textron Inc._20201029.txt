Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Textron Third Quarter Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Eric
Salander. Please go ahead.

Eric Salander
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone.

Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call
today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC
filings and also in today's press release.

On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief
Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our
website.

Revenues in the quarter were $2.7 billion, down from $3.3 billion in last year's third quarter. During this
year's third quarter, we reported net income of $0.50 per share compared to $0.95 per share in the third
quarter of 2019.

Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.53 per share for the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted
net income excludes $7 million of pretax special charges, $0.03 per share after tax, related to the
restructuring plan announced in the second quarter. Segment profit in the quarter was $189 million, down
from $297 million in the third quarter of 2019. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions
totaled $344 million up $163 million from last year's third quarter.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone.

Overall, the third quarter results reflected a strong operating performance across all our teams with strong
cash generation and improved margins.

At Bell, we had a very strong quarter with 15% operating margin on slightly higher revenues. On the
commercial side of Bell, we delivered 41 helicopters, down from 42 in last year's third quarter.

Military remained strong in the quarter, largely due to higher aftermarket volume on existing contracts in
support of the V-22 and H-1 fleets. Also in the quarter, Bell continued to increase the scope of its support
of the U.S. military aircraft with the award of a new $213 million H-1 spares contract. In the past year, H-1
aftermarket contracts now total over $1 billion.

Also in the third quarter, Bell definitized a $272 million contract on the H-1 program with the Czech
Republic for 8 Yankees and 4 Zulus. On future vertical lift, the V-280 continues to fly in support of the
Army's risk reduction program and has now flown over 190 hours as we continue to demonstrate the
capabilities of this aircraft to our Army customer.

On FARA, Bell has begun building a 360 Invictus prototype aircraft, starting with gearboxes, rotors and
airframe structure.

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

And within Textron Systems, the third quarter was strong with margins of 13.2%. In the quarter, Systems
was awarded an initial contract to support the ground-based strategic deterrent missile system as a
subcontractor to the Northrop Grumman with work beginning this year. Also in the quarter, Systems
received an additional task order for the Air Force CAPCAS program to support Eglin Air Force Base. This
award is in addition to the 2 bases announced at the end of the second quarter.

Systems also announced the successful flyaway of the first 2 Ship-to-Shore Connector Craft 100 and 101.
These 2 craft are now stationed to Panama City, Florida, where they've been placed in the testing and
operational roles by the U.S. Navy.

At Aviation, revenues were down in the quarter as expected from lower new aircraft deliveries and
aftermarket volume. We delivered 25 jets, down from 45 last year, and 21 commercial turboprops, down
from 39 in last year's third quarter. While the pandemic impacted volume in the quarter, we did see
aircraft utilization levels continue to recover, and we're encouraged by new order flow. Order activity was
strong in the quarter, reflecting an increase in new aircraft bookings that resulted in backlog growth of
$400 million to $1.8 billion at the quarter end.

On the new product front, we inducted the third Cessna SkyCourier into the aircraft certification program,
which data it had accumulated over 240 flight hours. Program is progressing well, and the aircraft is on
track for certification and entry into service in the second half of 2021.

We announced the new Beechcraft King Air 360, which recently received FAA-type certification. This
updated turboprop includes technological advancements to the flight deck and enhancements to passenger
comfort.

Moving to Industrial. Revenues were down from last year's third quarter primarily due to lower volume in
specialized vehicles, principally reflecting the timing of snowmobile deliveries and reduced demand in the
ground support equipment business.

At Specialized Vehicles, we continue to see strong retail demand in our outdoor powersports business
during the third quarter and expect revenue growth in the fourth quarter.

At Kautex, the automotive production outlook has steadily improved since the low point in May, and
demand from our customers has returned faster than anticipated. Kautex teams have responded well
in managing costs and executing through these challenging times and delivered a strong operating
performance in the third quarter.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone.

Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues at Textron
Aviation of $795 million were down $406 million from a year ago largely due to lower Citation jet volume
of $234 million, lower aftermarket volume of $95 million and lower commercial turboprop volume of $83
million. Segment loss was $29 million in the third quarter, down from $104 million of profit last year
primarily due to the lower volume. Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at $1.8 billion.

Moving to Bell, revenues were $793 million, up $10 million from last year on higher military volume,
partially offset by lower commercial revenues primarily due to the mix of aircraft sold in the period.
Segment profit of $119 million was up $9 million largely due to a favorable impact from performance.
Operating margin at this segment was 15%, up 100 basis points from last year. Backlog in this segment
ended the quarter at $5.7 billion.

At Textron Systems, revenues were $302 million, down $9 million from a year ago primarily due to lower
volume of $20 million at TRU Simulation + Training. Segment profit of $40 million was up $9 million due to
a favorable impact from performance, partially offset by lower volume. Operating margin of 13.2% was up
320 basis points from last year's third quarter. Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at $1.9 billion.

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Industrial revenues of $832 million were down $118 million from last year primarily from lower volume
of Specialized Vehicles. Segment profit was $58 million, up $11 million from the third quarter of 2019
primarily related to the favorable impact from performance of $24 million, principally reflecting cost
reduction activities, partially offset by lower volume and mix. Operating margin was 7%, up 210 basis
points from last year's third quarter.

Finance segment revenues were $13 million, and profit was $1 million. Moving below segment profit.
Corporate expenses were $28 million, and interest expense was $38 million.

With respect to our restructuring plan announced in the second quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $7
million on the special charges line.

Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we entered into a closing agreement with a state taxes authority
that will result in the recognition of tax benefits that will reduce our tax expense in the fourth quarter by
approximately $40 million to $50 million.

Turning to the balance sheet. We issued $500 million of fixed rate 10-year notes at a coupon of 2.45%
in the third quarter, and used the proceeds to pay down the $500 million 360 loan that we entered
into in the first quarter. Following the cash performance in the quarter, we ended with approximately
$2.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and we have effectively prefinanced all our existing term debt
maturities through 2021. In the fourth quarter, we expect to repay $350 million of floating rate notes due
in November and $362 million of outstanding borrowings on the corporate-owned life insurance policies
that were drawn in the first quarter for additional liquidity.

While we continue to believe it is prudent to maintain a higher-than-normal cash balance as we close out
the year, we expect to reactivate our share repurchase program on an opportunistic basis in the fourth
quarter.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Scott.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Thanks, Frank. To wrap up, our teams executed very well and generated solid results in the third quarter.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our defense businesses to continue their strong performance.
At Aviation, we anticipate a return to profitability as they begin to capitalize on the new aircraft order
flow generated in the third quarter. And in Industrial, we expect a continuation of the rebound in our end
markets.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we can open the lines for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.

Robert Alan Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

First of all, Scott, I was wondering if there's been any change to your thoughts on 2021 deliveries at
Aviation. Are you still thinking about the same as you were 3 months ago?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

I think the order flow has been encouraging, Rob. And I would say at this point, our plan is that we
probably see about half of the recovery. If you look at the dip from '19 into '20, we would expect to see
about half of that come back in demand in '21.

Robert Alan Stallard
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And then secondly from me, in terms of the fourth quarter, you gave us some end points on the
business. But I was wondering if the very strong cash flow that you saw in the third quarter can be
continued. Or did you pull some items forward into the third quarter?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

I think we'll continue to see good cash flow. It's pretty balanced across working capital and across all
segments of the business. As you know, we tend to have growth in inventory going into a fourth quarter
and then burn that down. And this year, inventory was obviously something we've been managing much
more closely, but I expect that we will continue to see good cash generation in Q4.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.

Peter J. Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Scott, just maybe good to see the backlog kind of spike up at Aviation. Can you give us a little color there
on kind of what the mix of what you're seeing there?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, it's pretty much across the board. We've seen nice pickup in jet activity, and it really is from lights
through our midsize, super-midsized platforms, which is good, and also pretty strong order activity in the
King Air family.

Peter J. Arment
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Okay. And just as a follow-up and staying in Aviation, just the lower aftermarket demand, I guess it still
seems a little surprising to us just given what we've heard about biz jet flight activity. What are you seeing
there? And do you expect that actually to start to turn the corner before we see deliveries pick up?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Well, I mean, there -- it -- sequentially, it certainly is improving, Peter. So it's still down in the sort of low
to mid-20s on a year-over-year basis. But as we've seen the flight activity continue to grow, the services
coming back with that, so it's not surprising that it would trail a little bit. But we don't think it will get back
to comparable on -- in fourth quarter, but we certainly expect to see it continue to sequentially improve.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.

Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

On Aviation, I realize there was a tough slug from the losses in Q2, but how do we think about the path to
breakeven and moving pieces that you saw in Q3 and going forward?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I think given the backlog that we've seen and deliveries that are scheduled now for Q4, Sheila, I
definitely think that we'll see profitability at Aviation in Q4. What we're trying to get that to call all the
way back to kind of a breakeven on the year, whether we get there or not, it's -- it will probably be close
depending on how the demand and service activity and whatnot happens in the quarter. But certainly,
we're expecting a profitable Q4 and getting the business back to breakeven.

Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then switching over to Bell, I think there's been a lot of noise from third parties on FARA
and FLRAA on the future of the program, which I disagree with. But perhaps you could provide us your
thoughts, Scott, on how you're thinking about that. And if there's any change with the administration next
week, how you think about the future of that program, too.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. I think we continue to have a lot of dialogue from the working level all the way to very senior
members in the Army. There is no question that they are very committed to the FVL programs. It's one of
the highest priority programs they have in modernization in the Army. They realize it's absolutely critical
to their capability and the role that they play whether that's in near peer competition or just in general. I
know they recognize that they're operating aircraft that are 40 going on 50 years old technology. And for
sure, they've been upgraded over the years, but the capability that they're looking for in FVL is something
they need.

As I said, it's a very high priority. They're like -- they're rational people. They understand budgetary
pressures, and they know there will be budgetary pressures regardless of whether there's a change in
administration or not, I'd say, over time.

But look, these are very long-cycle programs, and they're committed to the programs. And they've worked
hard to make sure that they have the ability to budget and fund these programs. And obviously, from
our standpoint, we're very focused on continuing to execute on it. As I said in the prepared remarks, the
V-280 continues to fly. It's done great.

As you know, we've been over 300 knots flight level. We've demonstrated level 1 maneuverability. So the
most critical things that they're looking for in speed and range, maneuverability, we've demonstrated now.
Hard to believe it, but we've been -- the flight test program, almost 3 years in December. So -- and on the
far front, we're making great progress. We started to build the initial critical components of the aircraft.
So I think our teams, even through the whole COVID process, continue to make great progress and work
hard at demonstrating the capability of the products that we've designed and build for the Army. So we
feel very good about the program.

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

Just wondered if you could speak about the margin performance of Bell and the productivity commentary
there. And just if you encountered any COVID-related costs and how you anticipate if you get -- if there's
reimbursement of those or just -- what it was that you saw that drove that.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

So look, on the cost front, I mean, for sure, there are some costs that are directly incurred. We had some
disruptions here and there. But I had to say that, that business, and this has been true in several of our
businesses, continue to operate through the whole COVID process. And obviously, we had to put all the
proper safety protocols in place, and I think those have been very successful. But our guys have continued
to execute.

We're getting the output. We're delivering what the customer needs. Obviously, one of the things we're
benefiting from is we've seen a significant uptick in the amount of activity on the installed base. Contracts
on V-22 and H-1, and that's driven some additional volume through some critical parts of the factory,
which has yielded good productivity. So I think that, for sure, there have been some minor -- relatively
speaking, I would say, minor costs incurred in the process of working through a difficult time. But really,
what you're seeing in terms of margin performance is just good solid performance by our teams and
executing well on some increased volume going through the shops.

Carter Copeland
Melius Research LLC

Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up on Aviation. Just with respect to Q4 deliveries, what you're
looking for there, I mean I know it's been -- there have been some challenges getting some aircraft
delivered and whatnot due to restrictions. How are you thinking about the remainder of the year just as
it's important to think about the '21 commentary you gave us earlier?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I would say there's -- like there's a -- there's risk here and there on a couple of aircraft if a customer
is unable to show up or get the -- take the delivery. Again, we're still living in a bit of a dynamic world,
obviously, in terms of restrictions around travel and things like that. But at least as we see it right now, it's
sort of one-offs here and there. It's not -- we don't expect it to be a material number.

Obviously that could change if there's a real big change in terms of travel restriction. But -- and again,
they're much like at Bell, the teams are working. We have occasional disruptions on supply base issues
and things like that, but in general, are working our way through it. So I think we feel pretty confident
that we'll be able to deliver on the volume that we're expecting to see in Q4. And obviously, we expect to
see the same in that assumption in terms of how we recover and increase volume in 2021.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Yes. Scott, you avoided answering Carter's question about specific deliveries in the fourth quarter. I mean
are you expecting somewhere around 50 deliveries in the fourth quarter?

Scott C. Donnelly

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Chairman, President & CEO

I didn't think Carter's asked for a specific number. Of course, if he had, I would have evaded the question.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Okay. So you're going to evade my question as well?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I'm sure you know we don't give a forecast of the exact numbers. And look, it's not an environment
probably where we would do that. But certainly, we feel like the order book coming through Q3, we're
pleased with the amount of activity. We're pleased with the amount of activity that we're still seeing out
there in the marketplace. And look, I think our expectations are that we'll see a decent recovery coming
out of this. This is, as you know, a very different environment than maybe what we've seen before, where
we had challenges in this end market. The used market continues to be robust.

If you look at activity in that light to mid-sized jet market in the U side is quite strong. I mean you hear
brokers talking about that all the time. We certainly see that in selling our own used aircraft business. So
again, these -- as you know, these things are all sort of subject to something crazy happening from an
overall market environment. But right now, we think the demand is looking pretty good. The fundamentals
are good, and then we ought to be able to deliver a good fourth quarter.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

In terms of orders in the fourth quarter, Scott, you expect orders to be significantly better than Q3? I
mean usually, your fourth quarter is the biggest order quarter.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Q4 can be a decent quarter, George. As you know, usually, the book-to-bill is not there because
usually our strongest delivery quarter is in Q4. So -- but as I said, I think right now, we are continuing
to see good activity. Look, some of those aircraft are things that we'll deliver in Q4. But for sure, we're
starting to see bookings and things that are -- aircraft deliveries are out in 2021 as well.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

But I mean like last year, the implied orders in Q4 were $1.5 billion versus $1.2 billion in Q3, so you did
almost $1.2 billion this Q3. Would you expect to see $1.5 billion in orders in Q4?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes, George, I don't -- I honestly don't know. I mean I think that trying to dial in on that number is
something we probably won't do and just -- because we just don't know, right?

I mean, look, our sales teams are out there. They're selling. I'm encouraged by the amount of activity.
We're seeing deals close. Aircraft are moving at a good pace. So I mean we never guided that number, but
we certainly feel good about what's going on in the end market.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

And the percentage of orders in the quarter from net jets, can you disclose that?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

We do not. But suffice to say, there are orders in the quarter, and I expect there to be orders in the
quarter for Q4. So again, look, the encouraging part about what's going on in the market is that we're
seeing increased activity in flight hours, and we're seeing increased demand when we talk to guys that
are, frankly, that are charter operators of our aircraft from companies that are guys that wheels up, that
are membership-oriented kind of companies.

And from NetJets, who, as you know, is a very important partner for us in that fractional market. The
demand in all of those areas appears to be quite strong, which is encouraging not only for deliveries this
year, but also we're building some order book and giving us some visibility into 2021.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

I guess asking George's question another way, did NetJets or has NetJets fully rebooked what they
debooked in Q1?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Okay. So we're -- we've never given backlog by aircraft and certainly not by customer. So I don't think we
would provide that guidance.

I would say from a color standpoint, we feel good about where NetJets is. I think they feel good about
where their market is, and they're seeing strong demand. And a lot of it is new customers coming to the
market, which is good for business aviation overall.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And just roughly taking, Scott, the delivery now forecast that you're talking about for 2021, it looks
like the last time you were at similar kind of volume assessment was a mid-single-digit margin business.
Is that the right place to think about for next year just, I guess, given the cost cutting that you've done
and maybe a bit of a different mix in terms of bigger airplanes coming through?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

No, look, guys, I mean, obviously, we're not doing 2021 guidance at this point. But when we get to the
call in January, we would expect at this point that we'll get back to providing you that kind of revenue and
margin expectations for the year.

David Egon Strauss
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. I guess last one then. Looking at Industrial Kautex versus vehicles, was Kautex actually up year-
over-year in the quarter? And I think you comment special -- the vehicle side would be up in Q4. Is that
sequentially or year-over-year you're talking about?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, from a revenue standpoint, we weren't back to where it was on a year-over-year basis. And
obviously, the same is true in the Specialized Vehicles business. But we did see a recovery, frankly, that
was stronger than we expected, particularly in North America and Asia, look strong. Europe is still a little
bit soft. So revenue was not up on a year-over-year basis, but it was up significantly, obviously, from
where we were in Q3 and delivered good margins.

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen.

Cai von Rumohr
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

And good results. so I was kind of surprised by how good numbers were at Industrial and Bell and as well
as the extent of the drop at Aviation. Could you maybe walk us through any favorable adjustments or
unfavorable adjustments particularly EACs? And where there any sort of catch-ups or anything in the profit
because those numbers at Industrial are kind of better than anything I can think of that you've done in a
long time?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

So sure, Cai. Well look, in Industrial, we don't -- that's not the kind of counter, so we don't do the EACs
or catch-up sort of things like that. I think that, obviously, as we went through the last 6 months, there
was a lot of focus on efficiencies and cost reductions and trying to optimize the operations. So as volume
came back into those businesses, they performed well and delivered good margin. We expected in --
for instance, in the Kautex side, we were anticipating all along getting some fairly good mix, a lot of the
newer technology particularly around hybrid vehicles and things like that, where we have a good position
and a strong product line, are contributing there as well.

So on the Industrial front, it was just delivering and converting well on volumes starting to come back into
those businesses. I don't think there's anything particularly notable on the -- like I say, I think the best
color to give you on Bell is that we really have seen nice growth in the aftermarket side particularly on the
military programs, in H-1s and V-22s. And that's driven additional volume and a critical technology for us,
right? That's a lot of our gearboxes, rotating things and blades and things of that nature, which help to
drive good productivity and efficiency in terms of utilization of the factories. And that I think falls through
as good margin business.

And then so Bell, you consistently talk of the drop in margins to 10% to 12% and the margins pretty
consistently go up. How should we think about where your margins might be next year?

I mean does 10% to 12% assume kind of the level of military aftermarket you were seeing, and therefore,
that's now too low? Or are we going to see a steep drop-off? And if so, why is it? Because it looks like you
would be headed for a cliff. Maybe talk a little bit about the trend we should expect in '21.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Cai, I think that we'll obviously give the guidance in '21 at a later time. But overall, we work again
on these, on -- in some cases, multiyear contracts. We've had additional volume come in. But as you
know, as you do future contracts, these are negotiated deals, and you expect to see some pressure on
some of those margins once that higher volume is in there and goes into your base numbers. But a lot
of it will depend, frankly, for us on what level of R&D do we continue to spend around these FARA and
these FLRAA programs, which will certainly pressure. As you know, those are cost-share programs, so the
government is funding a lot of that, but there is still a contribution for us to have to make in support of
those programs. And there's still a lot of work to do there.

So that will put some margin pressure on a go-forward basis as well. And over the long term, it will
depend a lot on how we do on volume of bringing in additional FMS cases and things of that nature. So,
okay, I still think this is a low double-digit margin business. We've always said that 10% to 12% number.
Originally, people didn't believe us and said, "No. It's going either to 8% to 9%." Now people don't believe
us and say, "It's going to be 13% to 14%." So on the average, it sounds like 10% to 12% is probably
about right.

Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

Could you -- last one, could you give us any sizing of the EACs you've been seeing there at Bell as you
come down the end on the V-22?

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

Well, not at Bell. I mean the program adjustment for the quarter was $22.5 million compared to $21
million last year. So on a year-over-year basis, total Textron, there is no big deal.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. There was no change on a year-over-year basis, really. And so, Cai, I think we had good margins in
the Systems side as well. And I think part of that is, look, we're sort of turning the corner, I would say, on
the Ship-to-Shore development program. We've started getting more craft deliveries. Production lines are
starting to run better. We're starting to get supply parts coming in at the right time.

Obviously, we've got the initial units now from the definitized production contract are starting to enter into
production. So that's a program that obviously is going to start to be a contributor to the profit. And the
rest of the business, frankly, continues to perform well, and we expect that as we see some of these new
things, like the CAPCAS programs start to roll in, again, that will generate revenue and good margins. So I
think that Systems is also going to run in that low double-digit margin area.

Next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.

Kristine Tan Liwag
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

I just wanted to circle back on Textron Aviation. For the bookings that you've had so far, can you provide
more color on the pricing environment and competitive dynamics?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

No. No, look, we had slight positive pricing in the quarter, and you'll see that. But again, the market, I
think, again, it's -- it benefits from not having this huge number of used aircraft out there, particularly not
new, young used aircraft that it puts pricing on customers considering do they buy a used aircraft or new
aircraft. So that's a positive for us.

I think -- look, I think we all know, in general, people were planning higher production rates this year than
what the demand has turned out to be in the market. So you do occasionally see deals where someone's
trying to move aircraft, and we're trying to be much more disciplined about that and instead, [ bringing ]
our production volumes and maintain reasonable pricing. And I think that's what you'll -- you'll see in the
quarter is that we had slightly positive pricing.

Kristine Tan Liwag
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

And also, as flight departments plan out their fleets, to what extent has fewer commercial airline affected
their buying decision so far? And when you think about customers who are in the cusp of ordering an
aircraft that hasn't quite signed the dotted line, what's the variable that they're looking at that would
make them more confident in ordering? Is it more visibility with the economy? Is it a vaccine? Easing
border restrictions? Can you just provide more color in terms of their decision tree?

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

It's hard to say. I mean to be anecdotal, I guess, I mean every customer is a bit different. But there's no
doubt that as an industry, I mean we're seeing a new aircraft. I believe that, again, charters and clubs and
fractional owners are also seeing this, that you have people that are coming into business aviation that
have not historically been in business aviation or owned an equity piece of an aircraft.

And clearly, the -- again, the macro environment out there right now is, is there some health dynamic
to it? There probably is. Is it also the fact that for lots of companies and individuals that aren't around
hub airports? We all know that when you see the dramatic reduction in the number of commercial flights,
particularly if you have to connect through some place, the reduction in the number of flights is making it
very difficult for people to get from point A to point B in the country without taking a whole day doing it.

So I think the convenience factor, which a lot of customers obviously have enjoyed for many, many years,
is becoming more appealing to a lot of other folks as it becomes harder to travel commercially. And look,
our view on over the long term is maybe some of that is people that might charter. I mean maybe they
go back to commercial airlines someday. But we think a lot of people, once they've experienced the
convenience and the productivity and efficiency of traveling private, they'll stick with it.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv from Citi.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Scott, just kind of big picture, what's the visibility and confidence to getting back to sort of what I'll call it
'18, '19 segment profit levels? Like what's in your control versus what's not in your control?

And your pre-COVID, at least you talked about Aviation gaining pricing to deliver better margin. Are
you seeing that pricing now? Industrial had room for self-help pre-COVID. That's still the case. So just
realistically, what's the path back here?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, look, I mean, obviously, it's different in each one of the businesses. First of all, obviously, in Bell
and Systems that have not seen nearly as much disruption going through this, have continued on
delivering good margins. I think Bell is in a very good place. Systems, we all know needed some self-help
particularly around the Ship-to-Shore Connector program, which, as I said, is steadily improving.

And we're starting to feel good about that, and not only in executing what we have, but having got the
first production contract under our belt. So I think those guys are going well. Things like the CAPCAS
program which, look, that was a nontrivial investment for us to get all those aircraft ready and now
putting them to work is -- will be a nice turn in the performance of that business.

So I think those guys are fairly straightforward. If you looked in the Industrial businesses, Kautex
generally converts well and performs well and I think are showing that as we come back through the auto
cycle. And I expect them to continue to perform well. As you know, the volume is usually lighter in the
automotive industry in Q4. But I think that, again, they're getting back into their normal stride and will do
well.

We know we had things to do in the industrial side around channel development in particular. And I think
that we're seeing the benefits of our relationship with Bass Pro on the tracker side. Our Arctic Cat channel
is also performing well, and we're seeing good retail volume through those channels. So I think the cost
structure, as we talked about before, we are consolidating some facilities and reducing footprints. And as a
result of those restructuring activities, I think we come out of this cycle in TSV in a much better place. So
that should drive improved performance versus what we've seen in the past.

Look, aviation is very much a volume game. We've obviously had to go through some very difficult
restructuring here just in terms of adjusting for a lower volume than we -- where we were. In 2018, '19

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

time frame, as I've said, I think we'll probably get half of that back is kind of how we think about 2021
and then get back to the road that we were on when we get into the future years.

I think our product lineup has never been better, right? When you look at where we are with Latitude and
Longitude, SkyCourier is coming along very nicely. So it's been a rough year for sure for that team, but
they continue to make the kind of progress in terms of the positioning of the products and the business
and the cost that we should be able to get back on our -- back on track here as we go into 2021 and
beyond.

Jonathan Phaff Raviv
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

And then just following up on the Aviation comment, you talked about getting back to the previous road
that we were on. I mean is double-digit margin in that segment a pipe dream at that -- at this point?

Or is that a realistic goal? And then -- and also, I'd just say thinking about production rate as a function of
that, you talked about getting half deliveries back in '21. What does it say about production rate in '21?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, look, guys, I mean, obviously, we've always been trying to target of getting back to double digit. We
were making good progress, I think, towards getting there. But as I said, you do need to have volume,
right? I mean we have to have a market that has got enough demand that we can get volumes back there
to do that. And I think, again, we are getting there. A big part of it was, obviously, this year having a full
year of Longitude. And obviously, that -- I mean we have a full year of Longitude, but overall, the business
has seen a dramatic reduction in demand.

So -- and as I said, I think we'll get about half of that back. So when we think about the production run
rates for 2021, it's targeting a delivery that's going to be somewhere in between where we are this year
and where we were in 2019. So we're setting production run rates to achieve that. Obviously, run rates
increase through the course of the year because we expect, again, when you think about 2022, that you're
back up maybe to where you were in '19. But this is a plan, guys, right? I mean to think that we have that
kind of visibility in this market, we haven't had that kind of visibility in this market in a very, very long
time.

So, again, I feel very good about the macro environment. The fact that there's not used aircraft out there,
the fact that we have a very nice product lineup with a [indiscernible] makes us feel comfortable that we
should be thinking that way and planning that way. But obviously, we'll make production line and volume
decisions as things play out.

Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America..

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Maybe on the biz jet side, just following up on the whole string of questions that we've had. When the
time comes to ramp back up, right, which hopefully isn't too far out, how difficult will that be, right? I
mean given the restructuring that's going on, how is your workforce in Wichita? And do you have a sense
on how your supply chain is doing?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, look, I don't think it's that difficult to ramp back up, Ron. I mean we're not -- we're certainly not
straining our supply chain, obviously. So we have to do -- we have to work very closely with guys like
Pratt and Williams and Honeywell around volumes on engines, which obviously are a pretty long lead item.
Avionics it kind of -- I mean, look, there's nothing magic about it, right?

15

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

I mean you -- we work with our supply chain all the time to do these forecasts and kind of line things up.
Frankly, if I looked at some of the things that have been the longest lead times and the most constraining
things in supply base are typically, as you know, around bearings and castings and forgings. And to be
honest, right now, there's a lot of capacity that's been freed up. I mean the -- these are common suppliers
to commercial aviation.

And so as those volumes have dropped the supply chain, frankly, our biggest struggles over the last 4 or
5 years. I mean the team works through it, and obviously, it hasn't been a problem in the end, but there's
a lot of work that goes into ensuring that we get the right supply and source of supply for a lot of those
critical items. And that was strained because of the very, very strong demand in the commercial side.

Obviously, that's not the case today. So we still have to do a good job of forecasting and working with
suppliers. But I'd say, solving those issues is easier than it has been for the last 10 years.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And then -- and maybe another question -- another Aviation question, if I may. If you look at the fleet
utilization today, do you guys have a sense on how many Citations are being used just for personal, leisure
travel as opposed to business travel?

And I guess my question is this, right? When we get to a post-COVID world, and you have people flying
for business and for all the other reasons they fly, one of the things that kind of seems to me that could
happen is business aviation post-COVID could be actually far more robust than it was pre-COVID because
of what happened during COVID. So my question is, do you see any evidence of that? Is that something
you guys talk about? Or am I completely off base?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

No. Look, I think that's the macro environment that I think is a positive, all right? The -- there -- first of
all, to answer your first question, I mean we don't have the data, right? I mean we don't -- we know all of
our Citations flying. We have very, very good information on all that stuff. But nobody checks a block that
says, "Hey, this is a personal trip or a business trip."

So I mean we don't have that data obviously to break it out. But I think we know when you see the
market coming back and you got 85% of the flight hours, we all know that business conventions aren't
happening. You guys aren't having conferences. There's -- I mean there just isn't -- we all know there's
nowhere near as much business travel happening today as there was a year ago. And so we know that --
therefore, that, that gap and that increase has a lot of personal use going on of aircraft.

And certainly, we know this from discussions with our charter operators, the club guys, our fractional.
Everybody knows that there is a lot more personal travel going on than you would normally see. I mean
if we look at Europe in August, it was over 100% of a year ago. That's not business travel in Europe in
August, right? So you see a much higher utilization of these aircraft for personal reasons right now.

And so the case we would make and certainly it's how we think about it is when you think about business
travel coming back, and it is starting to come back, right? And there's no question more people are
traveling and moving around, but not in anywhere near the scale of what you would have seen a year ago,
that just as you're seeing more people opt to use business aviation for personal reasons, you're going to
see more people choose to use business aviation for business reasons. And so you're going to have both
higher utilization in personal and higher utilization in business. And therefore, that's what I say drives a
better macro environment than we've seen in a long time.

And again, as we look at orders, as we look at customers, that it is that kind of a mix in anticipation of
people, like already using it personally and anticipating using it more on the business front. So that's the
reason, frankly, for us to feel bullish about why this will recover in a positive way.

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

And again, also, of course, you have this dynamic of not having this large used market out there. So I
think we'll see aggregate demand increase, and it will look to the new aircraft demand because you don't
have a lot of new used aircraft out there to compete with it.

Ronald Jay Epstein
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes, that makes sense. And then one last one, if I -- kind of changing subjects completely. Before the
pandemic and kind of the whole world got turned upside down, you guys have made a bunch of progress
on reshaping the industrial portfolio. Are you comfortable with where it is? Or is there still work to do
there?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Look, there's always work to do, but we're comfortable with where we are. And, look, we're very focused,
obviously, at this point on executing and operating the businesses, and that's what we're doing. And I
think it's working.

Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Scott, last quarter, you had provided the forecast that 2020 Cessna jet deliveries would decline 30% to
40% for the year. And the first 3 quarters are 40 to -- down 40% to 50%. Is the fourth quarter decline
less than that 30% to 40% to still pull you into that range for the year? Or does the fourth quarter year-
over-year decline looked more like what it's been year-to-date?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

No, I expect that we'll see some recovery on those percentage basis as we go into Q4 based on the order
book and the level of activity we're seeing in the market.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Okay. So that 30% to 40% for the year stands?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

That's still how we're thinking about the year, correct.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then -- and maybe looking at Bell commercial somewhat similarly, the unit change year-over-
year there improved nicely in the third quarter versus the first half of the year. Maybe you could just
elaborate on what you're seeing from your customers in that market and how you're thinking about 2021
at this point.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, look, I think that we've certainly seen some softness on the commercial side, and it's largely driven
by the fact that it's like Aviation and a lot of things, it's hard to get a lot of face time with customers.
It's hard to kind of just get deals done. As you know, our Bell commercial business is heavy on foreign
customers. A lot of fleet operators, a lot of our bigger aircraft are international, and it's still a challenge to

sell and do demos. And frankly, a lot of these are government or private/public kind of things. And in a lot
of the world, it's hard for -- hard to get deals done.

So I think we'll continue to see that. And again, does that -- how does that change into 2021? I wish I
could tell you the answer to that. I mean it depends on how the virus is progressing and what different
countries do around governments really getting back to work and getting deals done. So it's been a
challenge through the course of the year, and I think it will continue to be one as we go forward.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Do you feel like you have less visibility on that on sort of where to set production there for next year than
you do with how you're speaking to the Cessna jet business?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

No. I think we are pretty well set on what we think the production levels need to be. Again, these are
relatively long-cycle production especially when you get into customization and things like that. So we've
made the adjustments that we think we need to make in terms of production. Like I said, I think the only
difference that's a little more challenging maybe, Noah, is the fact that a lot of them are international
customers, so.

Noah Poponak
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Yes. Okay. And Frank, on cash flow, working capital has been a not insignificant use of cash for a pretty
long time. And in the nice cash flow number you have in the quarter, it's -- it looks to be a source.

Are you at a pivot point where, with all the new jets in Cessna and some churn in some of the other
businesses, you've had to use working capital where you can now have that as a source of cash
sustainably for a while moving forward? Or is that a bad read?

Frank Thomas Connor
Executive VP & CFO

No. It -- I mean, look, it moves around, Noah, obviously, depending on seasonality of the business and
other factors. I think the teams have done a really nice job in decelerating as we went into the pandemic
and very -- being very focused on working capital utilization and cash generation. And that's reflected in
the numbers.

As we mentioned earlier in the call, we'll continue to see, I think, some liquidation of inventory in the
fourth quarter just on the higher volumes that we would typically see in that fourth quarter. But then we
would expect working capital to kind of seasonally move around as we move into '21.

So we -- we've been very focused on it. I think we're doing a better job of managing it, but there's always
going to be some quarter-to-quarter volatility to it. But we -- the teams have been very focused on it and
done a nice job with it.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

It's been a benefit. We won't quantify it, but it has been a bit of a benefit, but it hasn't been a kind of
significantly material number on cash.

Seth Michael Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Okay. And then if we were to end the year today, what kind of change in pension expense would you be
looking at for '21? And have you given any more thought to mark-to-market accounting?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. Look, so there's lots of things that go into the pension calculation, so I can't really kind of snap a line
today because we haven't done all of that analysis. From a discount rate standpoint, their interest rates
are down a bit, so that probably creates some headwind. There's a little bit of tailwind associated with just
the averaging of various gains and amortizations and things like that over time.

So it's ultimately kind of hard to tell where that will fall out. We wouldn't expect it to be a big headwind
as we look at '21, but it may be some headwind and kind of -- I'm not going to kind of comment around
looking at different kind of accounting policies vis-à-vis pension. We'll save that for if and when we were to
do anything in that regard.

Seth Michael Seifman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then maybe one bigger picture, Scott. In the past, I feel like discussions of the business jet demand
environment have often revolved around politics and elections and tax rates and all that stuff. And we're
potentially looking at a change in administration and a higher corporate tax rate. Is all that stuff kind of
irrelevant this time given the other demand drivers that you'd talked about? Or maybe we've just made
too much of it in the past?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I don't know, Seth. It's a good question. I mean this probably -- I'd have to say, normally, when
you see uncertainty or a question -- and for sure, we've seen that before, right, where people are kind of
waiting to understand the tax policy or the outcome of an election, but with no markets like uncertainty,
obviously. It's kind of interesting, obviously, this year, because of the pandemic, there's just so much
others world going around out there, that maybe it's hard to see what role politics is playing. I mean
generally speaking, I'd say we've seen that in the past, right, where people kind of hold off until they have
visibility, and then they kind of -- look, it's kind of interesting because in the end, everybody's -- goes
kind of back to where they were, right? It's just regardless of what the answer is in terms of a political
outcome.

It just seems like this year, because of all the other noise around the pandemic, it's -- doesn't seem to be
playing as a prominent role in discussions. But I'm sure there's some of it out there. But I think what the
-- in the insight, as we know, we have seen this before in election years, even when we see it in election
years. Once you get past the election, people kind of get back to their life, you know what I mean? And I
suspect that would be a dynamic here as well.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Yes. I just wanted to follow up on the margin at Bell and Systems. I mean the Bell margin was the highest
from my record since the fourth quarter of 2012 and the Systems was the highest since the third quarter
of 2009.

TEXTRON INC. FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 29, 2020

So I guess my question is, I mean, obviously, Scott, you've said the Bell margin is not sustainable yet. But
you -- does Systems margin still seems to be sustainable? Or it's a little bit abnormally high this quarter?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, like it's probably a little on the high side, George. I think, as I said, there -- we've been seeing
steady improvement, and a lot of that is self-help around getting the Ship-to-Shore connector program
squared away. I do think the team has made a really good progress on that, and that will continue to be a
contributor.

We've -- we have had things like the CAPCAS programs, which, again, as I said, has required an
investment, which is now converting into revenue and margin which will help us on a go-forward basis.
There's also -- there's a lot of new programs. There's a lot of R&D programs that are in there around
modernization, which all that will balance out, I think, to be, as I said, I think kind of a low double-digit
margin business.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

And what gets the margin at Bell down to the range you've talked about? I mean there had been some
expectation that this year would be weaker because you had the new V-22 by, I mean, obviously, getting
some benefit by growing after support for that program. But so what happens to get the margin to drop as
much as it seems to have to drop to get kind of to your guide?

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Well, again, I think we are ramping up R&D activity, and we'll see that continue into next year as we've
got more and more resource coming in particularly on the FARA program. Though I expect, as we continue
to make progress on FLRAA, we've seen a lot of requirements work here in the -- in this early phase of the
next phase of that program, and you'll start to see more engineering and R&D as we sort of head towards
kind of a PDR capability on that platform.

And I think, look, we are getting benefits of having more volume going through a lot of these shops. And
obviously, as you renegotiate and do future contracts, that volume goes in there, and we'll get negotiated
down to a more nominal margin on some of those things. But we are certainly -- I'm sorry, go ahead,
George.

George D. Shapiro
Shapiro Research

Sorry about that. Now this is kind of a trivial question. But you delivered one Citation X in the quarter. I
think the last time you delivered one was the first quarter of '19. So is there anything unique with that
one? Was that one just sitting in inventory? If you had any color on that.

Scott C. Donnelly
Chairman, President & CEO

Yes. I mean it's just -- I mean we've obviously phased that program out, so just the last a couple of
aircraft which we've been using for other reasons are just finally selling out of inventory.

Eric Salander
