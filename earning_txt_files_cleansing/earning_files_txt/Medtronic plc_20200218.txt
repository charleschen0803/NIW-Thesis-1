Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Medtronic third quarter earnings
conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[Operator Instructions]

I would now like to hand the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President, Head of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Ryan Weispfenning
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Fiscal Year 2020 Third Quarter Conference Call
and Webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karen
Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer; and Geoff Martha, Medtronic President, will provide comments
on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 24, 2020. After our prepared remarks, we'll be
happy to take your questions.

First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial
statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides
additional details on our performance and outlook.

During today's earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking
statements, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained
in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update
any forward-looking statement.

For this call, unless we say otherwise, rates and ranges are given on a constant-currency basis, which
compares to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 after adjusting for foreign currency. References to
organic revenue growth exclude the impact of our Titan Spine acquisition and currency. Reconciliations
of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on
our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or
gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.

With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar
Ishrak. Omar?

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported results for the third
fiscal quarter. Revenue growth was light this quarter, reflecting a series of largely transient issues, which
I'll walk you through in a minute.

The good news, however, is that this was more than offset by 90 basis points of operating margin
expansion, well ahead of our expectations, resulting in strong EPS and free cash flow growth, both ahead
of plan. Importantly, despite the top line shortfall this quarter, our Q4 outlook is unchanged as we expect
significant revenue growth acceleration excluding any impact from the coronavirus.

Q3 revenue grew 2.9% constant currency and 2.6% organic. Revenue growth fell short of our
expectations, driven in part by customers curbing their purchasing ahead of our new product launches,
principally in CVG and RTG. In MITG, we upgraded the group's ERP system in the U.S. and Canada to our
company-wide system, resulting in a temporary slowdown in our ability to supply customers, which, in
some cases, resulted in lost procedures and lasted longer in the quarter than we anticipated. That upgrade
is now complete, and as of early this quarter, we're in the process of returning to full supply.

MEDTRONIC PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

All of these items led to our quarterly revenue underperformance. We weren't able to offset these issues
given that many of them emerged late in the quarter. I'm not happy with this top line performance, and
we are focused on quickly addressing the dynamics that led to this result. Geoff will provide a little more
color on this later in the call.

Looking down the P&L. We drove significant operating leverage despite the softer top line. Our adjusted
operating margin expanded 90 basis points as we continued to see the benefits of our enterprise
excellence initiatives, particularly on the SG&A line. We also had strong financial leverage, driven in part
by the debt refinancing that we completed earlier this fiscal year. This resulted in an adjusted EPS of
$1.44, which was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 11.6% year-over-year.

Let's take a look now at the drivers for our group performances, starting with our Restorative Therapies
Group, which grew 3.6% organic this quarter. RTG's performance was affected by customer buying
patterns in BMP and the continued market slowdown and slight share loss in Pain Stim ahead of our DTM
therapy launch. On an organic basis, our overall Spine division was flat this quarter, reflecting customer
drawdown of Infuse inventory.

Despite this, our Core Spine business grew 2%, both globally and in the U.S. In addition, when you
include sales of enabling technologies sold by our Brain Therapies division, which is how our competitors
report, Core Spine grew 5% organically both globally and in the U.S., well above market.

Our Surgical Synergy strategy is resulting in increased sales of our Core Spine implants, driven by
surgeons' use of our capital equipment, in particular our Mazor robot. It is also benefiting our Brain
Therapies division, which sells the capital equipment used in spine surgery. Brain Therapies delivered
another above-market quarter of 9.2% growth. In Neurosurgery, which grew low double digits, we had
strong growth in Mazor robotics where we are meaningfully outpacing the competition as well as in
StealthStation navigation, O-arm imaging and our new Midas Rex MR8 systems.

In Brain Therapies, our market-leading Neurovascular business had another strong quarter with mid-teens
growth driven by mid-20s growth in ischemic stroke on strong adoption of our Solitaire X stent retriever,
Riptide Aspiration System and React catheters. In pain therapies, the pain Stim market had another
sluggish quarter, and we had some slight share loss ahead of the launch of the Stimgenics DTM therapy on
our Intellis platform.

We're excited about the response we've received from physicians and the broader SCS community
following the acquisition announcement and Stimgenics data presentation last month at NANS as well as
on our 9-year battery warranty on Intellis. We continue to be optimistic about the outlook for the Pain
Stim market and have begun training physicians on the DTM waveform.

Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 3.2% organic, including flat results in the U.S. MITG's
performance this quarter was affected by the upgrade of its ERP system in the U.S. and Canada, which
caused some temporary slowdown in our ability to supply customers with the full breadth of our products
and, in some cases, resulted in lost procedures. This was, however, a transient issue. The ERP upgrade is
now complete, and the related supply slowdown are behind us as of this month.

Within MITG, our Surgical Innovations division grew 3.6% this quarter, driven by our Advanced Surgical
business, particularly in Advanced Energy, which grew in the high single digits on strength in our LigaSure
franchise and sales of our Valleylab FT10 energy platform. Respiratory, GI and renal division grew 2.2%,
driven by low double-digit growth in our GI solutions business and high single-digit growth in pulse
oximetry sensors and advanced parameter sensors.

In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, we grew 1.8% this quarter, which was below our expectations, due
in part to customers holding back their purchasing ahead of new product launches in CRHF. We saw high
single-digit declines in our High Power business as customers awaited approval of our Cobalt and Crome
devices, which have launched this month in Europe and are expected to launch in the U.S. during Q1. In
heart failure, although our LVAD business has anniversaried the headwinds we faced over the past year,
the business declined in the low single digits and hasn't returned to the growth levels we were expecting.

MEDTRONIC PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

The other driver of our below expectation CVG performance was our U.S. TAVR business, which grew
13% this quarter, below the market growth rate. While the TAVR market has been rapidly expanding, we
currently have fully experienced field support coverage in a little more than 2/3 of the approximately 700
U.S. centers performing TAVR. We began aggressively hiring and training new field personnel months ago.
However, our data shows that it's taking longer than expected for our new reps to reach full productivity.
We plan to certify an additional 70 field personnel by the end of this fiscal year.

We expect our U.S. TAVR performance to improve relative to the market going forward as our expanded
field organization reaches full productivity and we focus the market on the hemodynamic benefits of Evolut
PRO+ platform and the launch of our new Confida sheath. Outside the U.S., our TAVR market share grew
modestly in Q3.

Our pacing business grew in the high single digits, well above the market, driven by our exclusive Micra
leadless pacemaker and AZURE family of conventional pacemakers. We announced the Micra AV approval
in the last week of our quarter and are excited about its growth potential as it expands the Micra target
population from 15% to 55% of pacemaker patients. While we did not have revenue from Micra AV in the
third quarter, we are already seeing strong interest and early adoption of this new technology in the fourth
quarter.

In Diabetes, we grew 0.8%, slightly ahead of expectations. Our U.S. business declined in the low double
digits, which is anticipated and resulted from competitive challenges while we await our new products.
We're seeing strong enrollment in our Next Tech Pathway program, which allows purchasers of the
MiniMed 670G to upgrade for free to our next-generation pump when launched. Keep in mind that as a
result of this program, we are currently deferring a portion of the revenue for our pump sales, which we
will recognize when patients trade in their 670G for the next-generation pump.

In markets outside the United States, which represents just under half of our Diabetes revenue, we had
solid mid-teens growth, driven by the continued adoption of the MiniMed 670G. This demand is not only
driving strong growth in our installed base. It is also resulting in double-digit growth in recurring revenue
from CGM and other consumables.

Now turning to emerging markets, which represented 17% of our revenue. In Q3, we grew emerging
markets 14% with contributions from geographies around the globe. China grew 14%, as is Southeast
Asia. And Eastern Europe grew 16%, which included 39% growth in Russia. In addition, South Asia
grew 13%, as did the Middle East and Africa. And Latin America grew 12%. We continue to drive strong
growth in these markets as we optimize the distribution channel and, in certain markets, localize R&D and
manufacturing.

Regarding the coronavirus, our top concern is the health and well-being of our employees in China and
across the globe. We have activated response teams in China, the Asia Pacific region and globally, and we
remain vigilant in monitoring the virus and taking action as necessary. All of our manufacturing operations
are up and running in China. We're committed to helping the Chinese government and Chinese physicians
address this crisis.

As the Chinese health care system is focused on containing the spread of the virus, hospitals in China
have experienced a slowing of medical device procedure rates, and we are seeing procedure delays. We do
expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth quarter financial results. But given the fluidity of this
situation, the duration and magnitude of the impact are difficult to quantify at this time.

Now turning to our product pipeline. As we look forward, we're excited about what lies ahead as the
investments we've made in our product pipeline begin to pay off by accelerating our revenue growth and
creating value for our shareholders. We have recently received approval or launched a number of new
products that we expect to contribute to our growth going forward.

I mentioned earlier the U.S. approval of our Micra AV pacemaker and the launch that is now underway.
We also received U.S. approval for our IN.PACT Admiral AV fistula indication, which expands the market
potential of our drug-coated balloons. We received U.S. approval and are launching our Stealth Autoguide
cranial robotic system. In Europe, we recently received CE mark approval for our Cobalt and Crome

portfolio of BlueSync-enabled high-power devices, our InterStim Micro rechargeable implantable sacral
neuromodulation device and InterStim SureScan MRI leads as well as our Percept PC DBS device with
BrainSense technology.

And over the next few quarters, we expect approval and launch of a number of additional new products.
We expect U.S. approval of the Cobalt and Crome high-power devices, Reveal LINQ 2.0 insertable cardiac
monitor, InterStim Micro and InterStim SureScan MRI leads and our Percept PC DBS device. We're also
expecting European launch of the MiniMed 780G and our DiamondTemp ablation catheter.

Regarding our MiniMed 780G in the U.S., we intend to file our adult clinical data with the FDA in March,
which will push expected approval beyond the fiscal year-end. In Pain Stim, we unveiled DTM spinal cord
stim last month at the NANS conference and are now training our field force on this novel waveform, with
an expected limited launch in Q4 and full launch in Q1.

In MITG, we continue to make progress in our soft tissue robotics program. Last week, we announced the
acquisition of Digital Surgery, a pioneer in artificial intelligence and analytics for surgery. They lead the
industry with their unique Touch Surgery ecosystem of products, including AI that identify surgical steps
and instrumentation. These products can be leveraged to provide insight into the procedure time, cost
and process to improve surgical care. We're excited about utilizing the strength and capability of Digital
Surgery to advance our minimally invasive and robotic surgery platforms.

We also have a number of important upcoming data presentations, starting with use case data under
extreme conditions for our advanced hybrid closed-loop algorithm at ATTD later this week. Next month,
ACC will be a big conference for us. Data from our OFF-MED renal denervation pivotal trial will be
presented as well as data for both low-risk bicuspid and leaflet immobility for our TAVR program. Also,
we will share risk stratification data for our TYRX anti-infection product. And finally, in June, at ADA, we
expect to present the U.S. pivotal data for our MiniMed 780G advanced hybrid closed-loop system.

This is just some of the near-term highlights from our pipeline. Importantly, we're continuing to invest in
building out a robust long-term pipeline of continuous innovation, invention and disruption.

I mentioned earlier that we expect significant acceleration in our fourth quarter revenue growth, driven in
part by our pipeline and excluding the impact of the coronavirus. And as we look to FY '21, we expect our
top line momentum to continue as we get the increasing benefit of the FY '20 product launches as well as
the products slated to launch next fiscal year.

With that, let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials and
forward outlook. Karen?

Karen L. Parkhill
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you. As Omar mentioned, we delivered third quarter organic revenue growth of 2.6%, and adjusted
EPS was $1.44, growing 11.6%. We ultimately came in $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance and
would attribute $0.02 to better-than-expected foreign exchange and $0.04 to operational outperformance,
including tax.

Our adjusted gross margin was 69.7%, down year-over-year due in part to increased China tariffs. We
more than offset that decline with strong operating leverage as we continue to implement and drive
efficiencies and improvements across the company while, at the same time, making investments ahead of
upcoming product launches. This led to an adjusted operating margin improvement of 90 basis points or
70 basis points excluding the impact of currency.

Below the operating profit line, our adjusted interest expense declined 36%, driven by our successful debt
issuance and tender transactions that we completed last spring and summer. Our adjusted nominal tax
rate was 13.6%, lower than we expected, due to increased deductions from the exercise of employee
stock options and benefit from finalizing taxes owed on certain returns.

MEDTRONIC PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

As you know, generating strong free cash flow remains a priority across the company, and you are seeing
this focus come through in our results. Third quarter free cash flow was $2.1 billion, up 21% from last
year. And year-to-date, free cash flow was $4.9 billion, representing a conversion ratio of 90%, well above
our full year target of 80%-plus.

We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing investment in R&D and tuck-in
acquisitions to drive future growth while returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our
shareholders, and year-to-date, we've returned $2.8 billion or 57% of the cash we generated, resulting in
a total shareholder payout of 51% on adjusted net earnings.

Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we are comfortable with current Street consensus on
organic revenue growth and EPS prior to any impact from the coronavirus. We expect overall organic top
line growth of approximately 4.5%. By group, we expect CVG to grow 4.25% to 4.5%; MITG, 6.25% to
6.5%; RTG, approximately 4% organic; and Diabetes to be flat to down low single digits. And based on
recent rates, currency would have a negative impact of 80 to 140 basis points.

On margins, we continue to expect our full year operating margin to expand by roughly 40 basis points on
a constant-currency basis, driven by our enterprise excellence initiatives. For the fourth quarter, we expect
our operating margin to be up slightly, including the impact of currency, or roughly flat on a constant-
currency basis as we invest to support current and upcoming product launches.

Below the operating line, we expect our fourth quarter interest expense to be approximately $160 million
to $165 million and our fourth quarter adjusted nominal tax rate to be around 16%, which would put our
annual rate at approximately 15%, lower than we originally expected and reflecting the benefits we have
had so far this year. We are raising our fiscal year '20 EPS guidance to a range of $5.63 to $5.65, up from
$5.57 to $5.63 and reflecting our third quarter bottom line outperformance. For the fourth quarter, we
expect $1.62 to $1.64.

As mentioned upfront, all of the guidance I just gave excludes the impact of the coronavirus. Because the
situation is so fluid, it is difficult to truly quantify the impact just a few weeks into our quarter. And for that
reason, we plan to provide an update for you later this quarter. Finally, I would like to note that we plan to
hold our Biennial Institutional Investor and Analyst Day on Tuesday, June 2 in New York City.

Back to you, Omar.

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Karen. I'd now like Geoff to make some remarks on the quarter and the outlook. Geoff?

Geoffrey Straub Martha
President & Director

Thank you, Omar. There are a number of positive things from the quarter that I want to highlight, but
first, I'd like to address our top line performance.

Even though much of it was transient, we did not perform at the level we were expecting, and the drivers
surfaced at the end of the quarter. We just can't have surprises like this, for us nor for you. And we are
making changes. At our upcoming Investor Day in June, I'm going to walk you through what innovation-
driven growth means for Medtronic and the comprehensive set of initiatives to take full advantage of the
pipeline. These initiatives are meant to ensure we see the acceleration of our revenue from the pipeline
and to improve our predictability.

On that note, I want to discuss an aspect of our plan to address the surprise we saw this quarter. One
issue is the weighting of our revenue to the final month of the quarter, which leaves us susceptible to
surprises late in the game, like what happened this quarter. Too often, our largest orders come in at the
end of the month. This dynamic makes the business challenging to manage, it stresses our operations,
and it really makes it difficult to mitigate headwinds that pop up within the quarter. So to fix this, we will
change our current operating mechanisms, certain internal metrics and some incentives as well.

MEDTRONIC PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

And I want to flag the opportunity coming up with our extra week in Q1. The impact of the changes that I
just mentioned likely won't be contained in a given quarter, so I'd like to use a good portion of the benefit
that we would get from the extra week in Q1 to launch these initiatives. So when we guide to the first
quarter, we will give you guidance on an underlying basis excluding the benefit of the extra week, and
we'll give you an estimate of the benefit of the extra week net of these changes. Like I said, we plan to
discuss these and other changes during our Investor Day. But I want to assure you one thing, that I'm on
this and we are taking the appropriate actions to improve consistency and avoid future surprises.

Now before I close and we get to Q&A, I've got to highlight a number of good things that occurred this
quarter, accomplishments that I believe can't get lost in this quarter's narrative. First, we drove a better
operating margin despite the light top line and free cash flow was outstanding. These are 2 things that
we've been working on for a long time. Over the past couple of years, we've taken action on both of
these areas, and we feel really good about the operating rigor and the culture we put in place to drive the
bottom line and improve cash flow.

Also, emerging markets growth continues to be strong for us. They represented 17% of our revenue and,
once again, grew strong double digits, 14% this quarter. We think of emerging markets actually as an
independent growth vector for the company, and we have to acknowledge the progress with our pipeline.
We are starting to see approvals and launches come through for important and innovative products, and
there's more to come. Yes, the slow purchasing ahead of these launches hurt us in some businesses this
quarter, but this is going to turn. Customers are really excited about our new offerings.

I'd like to end by saying that the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong. We have a full
pipeline that will accelerate our revenue growth and take share not just next quarter but next year and
beyond. We're very excited about the future of the company, the new technology that we're bringing
to market, the impact this will have on patients and physicians and the value we're going to bring and
generate for our shareholders.

All right. Back to you, Omar.

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Geoff. I couldn't agree more with the approach that we are taking, and I'm just as excited about
our outlook going forward. Before we start Q&A, I'd like to briefly note that we currently anticipate holding
our Q4 earnings call, which will be my last earnings call, on Thursday, May 21.

Let's now move on to Q&A. In addition to Karen, Geoff and me, our 4 group presidents: Mike Coyle, Bob
White, Brett Wall and Sean Salmon, are also here to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] If you
have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call.
Operator, first question please.

Question and Answer

Operator

Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.

Robert Adam Hopkins
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just I'll state both questions upfront to make it easy. First, I was wondering, in CVG, if we could drill down
a little bit on ICDs given the weakness in the quarter. And I asked because Boston Scientific also saw
weakness in the quarter in their high-power ICD business, and the timing of your new launches shouldn't
really be a surprise. So I guess my first question is how can you have confidence that this isn't just a
slower market? So that's question #1.

And then the thing I'd also love a quick comment on is -- I realize it's too early for formal fiscal 2021
guidance, but you guys have talked a lot about accelerating growth in fiscal 2021. So are you still
comfortable accelerating off of that 4.5% that we'll see hopefully in the fourth quarter on a same selling
day basis?

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

Thanks, Bob. Mike Coyle is the right person to address the ICD questions. Go ahead, Mike.

Michael J. Coyle
Executive VP and Group President of Cardiac & Vascular Group

Yes, Bob. We're not seeing anything that would cause us to have a concern that the overall market for
ICDs is somehow slowing significantly. Most of the challenges that we have on ICDs remain the issue
associated with the replacement cycle and the fact that we were seeing essentially mid-teens declines in
year-over-year comparisons on replacement. As I've mentioned before, that actually gets better as we get
through the year and into next year, especially in the CRT-D area, and that is going to help us in terms of
acceleration in the ICD side.

But the other point -- and you pointed out the surprise to us in terms of weakness in the number for the
quarter. It was really in EMEA, in Europe and Middle East and Africa. That was where, essentially, we
believe customers were holding off given the imminent launch of our Cobalt/Crome product families, which
now have launched into the market. And those products will be coming to the United States during the
first quarter.

The other thing that depressed the overall performance relative to where we thought we would be during
the quarter is the fact that the TYRX anti-infective envelopes get captured under the ICD numbers when
we report externally. And I think -- you may recall, last quarter, we had a fairly major quality-driven
back order situation that we expected would be resolved completely during the course of Q3. We actually
lost a number of -- lots of product -- manufacturing lots of product early in the quarter, which now has
stabilized. In fact, through the second half, we're completely out of any kind of constraints on supply.

So we expect that will flow through into the numbers in Q4 and obviously into next year, especially as
we have new data that we'll be presenting at ACC on risk stratification for TYRX. So we think all of those
things are going to help us accelerate the ICD market, not only in Q4 but into next year.

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Thanks, Mike. I think, Karen, you're the best person to take the question about '21.

Karen L. Parkhill

MEDTRONIC PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Yes. Thanks for the question on '21, Bob. Yes, we're really excited about our pipeline and what it has to
offer for FY '21. I'd love to talk a lot about it, but we're close to finalizing our plan so we'll give the official
guidance on our Q4 call, as you know. That said, I would think about accelerating growth for next year
off of a full year basis as opposed to off of a sequential basis. And we're very confident in our growth
acceleration of FY '21 over FY '20.

Ryan Weispfenning
Vice President of Investor Relations

Okay. Thanks, Bob.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.

David Ryan Lewis
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Just maybe just one question for me here. Karen, just to confirm from your last question, is the right way
to think about fiscal '20 -- I'm assuming a sort of 3.5% to 4%. But my one question, I'll keep it to one,
is just thinking about 4Q guidance. I appreciate it's in line with consensus, but when I think about Omar
and Geoff's comments about RTG and CVG, it seems like the 3Q dynamic is getting better into the fourth.
Should the fourth quarter be stronger as we see some of this catch-up revenue? So can you just help us
quantify the third quarter issues and offer some clarity of what fourth quarter implies in terms of recovery
and drivers of acceleration?

Karen L. Parkhill
Executive VP & CFO

Okay. So let me take the beginning of it, and then I'll let my colleagues jump in, too. So in terms of FY
'20, David, our fourth quarter guidance would imply FY '20 growth of 3.6%, 3.7%-ish. And then on fourth
quarter, clearly, because of the transient issues in the third quarter, we expect some of that to come back.
If you look at MITG and the ERP issues that we've talked about, we fully expect that to come back. And
that's one of the reasons that we've guided MITG to above trend for the quarter. But we have lost some
procedures, and those won't come back.

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

Yes. I think -- I don't know if I can add anything to that. Really, the procedure losses in a business like
MITG where the procedures happen, that just isn't going to come back. We'll recover fully. I think in other
areas like in the MCS business, or LVAD business, that was share loss. And there is pressure there, and
our growth is probably going to be lower than we were originally anticipating.

So in balance, we felt that holding the Q4 sort of previous guidance was the appropriate thing to do at this
stage. We're obviously doing everything we can to maximize that number.

Ryan Weispfenning
Vice President of Investor Relations

Okay. Thank you, David.

the U.S. Your competitor did a lot better than this. Maybe talk to exactly what happened in the quarter,
the dynamics in the U.S. and how you expect this continue throughout fourth quarter and '21.

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

Mike, do you want to take that?

Michael J. Coyle
Executive VP and Group President of Cardiac & Vascular Group

Yes, Robbie. Obviously, we were very disappointed with the performance in the U.S. If you look outside
the U.S., we -- the implant growth rates were in the high teens and pretty much in line with the overall
market, actually a little better than the overall market because of the Japan influence, but in the United
States, obviously well below market with implant rates in the mid-teens, whereas we would estimate
the market in the quarter probably grew on the order of the low 30s. As we dug into that, we obviously
headed into the holidays actually feeling pretty good that we were looking at implant rates in the low 20s.
Obviously, in retrospect, that turns out to be lower than the market.

But as we headed into the end of the year and into January, we saw a pretty meaningful decline in overall
growth rates for implants, and we dug deeply into that to figure out which accounts and where we were
having the issues. And basically, I think learning from that analysis was that it takes longer than we
thought to have our reps become fully competitive in this market. It's probably a 9- to 12-month training
exercise, which, in retrospect, we probably should have ramped up in advance of this several quarters
earlier than we did.

The good news is that as we look at the hiring that we did do, this quarter, we expect to bring on 70
new sales reps and support personnel, which is going to help us go from -- given the 700 accounts that
are selling ICD or selling -- that are servicing this market, we probably have seasoned sales reps, that
is those who have a year or more experience in about 2/3 of those accounts. By the time we exit with
these new certifications, we would expect to be closer to 80% in terms of supporting that. And we're also
accelerating new hiring based on driving support for our next fiscal year.

So we think those just catch up in terms of training and deployment. Plus we're pushing much more
closed interval management of the reps that are out there to make sure that we're staying on top of
developments in these accounts. We think that, coupled with, obviously, our new product launch around
Evolut PRO+; the launch of the Confida sheath, which really improves the performance of our overall
device systems; and then new data that will be coming out here at ACC around both bicuspid and leaflet
immobility, should basically give us an opportunity to accelerate from where we were in Q4 -- or in Q3.

And basically, looking at just the daily sales rates here as we've headed into the new quarter with this new
focus on rep productivity, we are seeing some acceleration from those numbers that you see in terms of
the mid-teens implant rates. And so I'm confident we're going to see acceleration. Whether we'll get all
the way back to market, given that we have 2 competitors who are driving share in those accounts, it may
take more than a quarter to do that. But on the other hand, I do expect to see acceleration during the
quarter.

I had 2 quick ones. One, on Surgical Robotics, I think you mentioned some software updates, just on time
line there. MITG, you have sequential acceleration. Is there anything baked on the robotic side there?

And second, on margins. I appreciate the comments on FX hedge gains. When you look at next year, I
think Geoff made some comments on changing incentives. So maybe just talk about margins for next
year. Are we still looking at constant currency in that 40 to 50 basis points of expansion?

Omar S. Ishrak

Okay. Let me -- Bob will probably answer this, but I'll just say off the bat that robotics is not in our
financial numbers yet. And the overall program is more or less on track, so...

Robert John White
Executive VP & President of Minimally Invasive Therapies Group

Yes, that's right, Omar. Thanks, Vijay, for the question. To reiterate, first off, no update from what
we talked about at JPMorgan relative to the program. So it's just good news. And then the sequential
acceleration of MITG's business is really all about us coming out of the ERP implementation now that we've
got that back on track and the system is running smooth. So hopefully, that does it for you, Vijay.

Vijay Muniyappa Kumar
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. And then on the margins, guys?

Karen L. Parkhill
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. Thanks, Vijay. On margins, for next year, we're going to continue to look at margin expansion as we
drive bottom line growth above top line growth every year. At this stage, we haven't changed our long-
range guidance of 40 basis points constant-currency margin expansion so you can assume that at this
stage.

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

I can tell you, Vijay, there's a focus in the organization around that. We've worked very hard to get an
accountability around that, and we're going to -- that's going to stay. We just need to fix our top line

MEDTRONIC PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Executive VP & President of Minimally Invasive Therapies Group

Yes. Let me take that, Omar. Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. The impact of the ERP transition affected
all of the MIT product lines as we migrated into the single SAP system for Medtronic. And certainly,
we lost some procedures when we weren't able to ship products to customers. So while we think we
lost procedures given the middle months of the quarter, we don't believe we necessarily lost significant
amounts of share. But certainly, now that we're back on track with the ERP system, we're back to fulfilling
those customer requirements.

Matthew Charles Taylor
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And just a follow-up for Mike or the team here. So it sounds like you're seeing a little bit of an
improvement in the DCB trends, at least in the U.S. Could you speak to that and whether you think we
could see a kind of continued uptick there or a change in the FDA stance at some point during the year?

Michael J. Coyle
Executive VP and Group President of Cardiac & Vascular Group

Sure. We are seeing some modest improvement. Obviously, as more datasets come in, they're providing
more comfort to physicians and the FDA for that matter, I believe, that the signal that had been observed
in those first 3 randomized trials around SFA seem not consistent with the new data coming in. Obviously,
one big dataset that we filed and got approval for was the AV fistula indication for DCB, which did not
show this mortality signal in the paclitaxel arm. And we expect additional data to be coming out on that
topic, including at the ACC, where we think there will be a presentation of a major dataset based on claims
analysis.

So that is creating a greater sense of confidence in the physician base that the significant morbidity issues
that come with not using these drug-coated balloons and just using PTA balloons are beginning to get
attention. And I think what we expect to see is continued improvement as datasets provide that level of
comfort. So in this quarter, we did see, on a sort of selling adjusted basis, some sequential growth, which
is encouraging in DCB. And we expect, if the data continue to come in as positive as they have, that we'll
see that continue.

Sean M. Salmon

Sure. Thanks, Kristen. So as you know, the Diabetes business certainly has no small challenges to
overcome. But I can tell you I'm really very encouraged with how we're seeing some derisking of the
pipeline that we have going forward. In particular, that sensor pipeline, I'm convinced that we've figured
that out, and it's just a bit of time for us to get the product line flowing there.

The 780G is an important catalyst for us to drive growth, and we expect that to begin. We have filed the
CE mark for that device, and we are anticipating, as Omar said, putting the clinical data module in, in the
March time frame. That review is going well. We're very interactive with FDA. In fact, we'll be meeting

So, so far, we're happy with what we're seeing both from the algorithms, and you'll see some of that later
this week as we stress the algorithm into some challenging conditions that will be announced at ATTD;
and the data front, and you'll see the full dataset coming up at the ADA in June. So I've seen a lot of
encouraging things. There are things to clean up obviously. We've got to get the new product flow going,
and we're confident that we'll be doing that starting soon.

expand upon that? Do you think there's an opportunity to bring forward some of the sensor time lines?

Kaila Paige Krum
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

So one quick one to clarify and then a question on the business. So on the coronavirus, I think you may
have mentioned this, but again, just to clarify. Will you give full transparency on your China business
performance in the fourth quarter?

Karen L. Parkhill
Executive VP & CFO

Yes, we will. And we did disclose our growth rates in China already so we will continue to disclose that. We
will be transparent about the impact of the coronavirus.

Kaila Paige Krum
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division

Perfect. And then there's obviously a lot of new product launches coming in the next few quarters. But --
I mean obviously, it can be challenging to predict the timing and the impact of when those new launches
contribute. So I'm just curious how you're modeling new product contribution in the fourth quarter as part
of that reacceleration in the business.

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

Well, there are some that are pretty clear. Things like the Micra AV, which launched last quarter, is now
in full steam and moving ahead well, and that one, we're projecting a strong success. There are others,
like the -- in the spinal cord stimulation market, we just launched the Stimgenics waveform on the Intellis
platform. That's picking up. That's -- we're a little more guarded about that because that's newer, but for
sure, that's going to help us in the spinal cord stimulation market.

MEDTRONIC PLC FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  FEB 18, 2020

Things like Cobalt/Crome in Europe, again, we have a history there, and we can project historically what
such -- that kind of improvement has caused and we're going to put that into our model. So there's a mix
of the level of sort of confidence intervals we have in these projections, some very tight, and Micra being
one of the biggest drivers is very tight. The other is a little more unknown but positive nonetheless.

I think that's the best I can do. I don't know, anyone else here, any products I've missed or any
comments, you guys?

Brett A. Wall
Executive VP & Group President of Restorative Therapies Group

Well, we've recently launched the Micro, which is the new public health product in Europe, which -- we're
excited about that and the possibility for that looking to a late spring launch in the United States. And then
Percept, which is the new DBS device with BrainSense technology, has just launched in Europe. Similar
time frames in the U.S. approval and we're getting good uptake on that. So those are 2 very interesting
platforms for us in the neuromodulation space.

Michael J. Coyle
Executive VP and Group President of Cardiac & Vascular Group

The other thing I would mention is the DiamondTemp ablation catheter CE mark that we expect during the
quarter, which would obviously be even more of a benefit in Q1 of next year. As well as we're just in the
early stages of the launch of the AV fistula indication for the IN.PACT Admiral balloon, so those will now
get full quarter benefit during Q4.

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

I think to your question about how we project this, there's a historical sort of comparison that we can
make against similar such launches. And based on that, we make a judgment in our planning, and from
that, we derive guidance and our plan going forward. So there's a variety of that, but there is some
judgment involved with this.

competitor? And what are your expectations for that business before Micro is approved in the U.S. in late
spring, which is what I heard you say a minute ago?

Michael J. Coyle
Executive VP and Group President of Cardiac & Vascular Group

So Larry, on Cobalt and Crome, we would expect that in the first quarter of next year, probably in the first
half of that quarter. And then for LINQ 2.0, we would expect that product also in Q1 but in the second half
of the quarter.

with that particular product given the competition. The Micro itself in Europe has been received very
well. Just as a reminder, it's about half the size of the competitive device. The recharge experience is
significantly better. And with the SureScan leads, it is 1.5 and 3 Tesla full body conditional. So we're very,
very excited about that product when it comes to the market in the United States.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Crédit Suisse.

Matthew Stephan Miksic
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

So I just have one on coronavirus and one on sort of the Symplicity Spyral time line and post the data at
ACC. So on corona, I understand it's a little bit early to put a finer point on the impact for Q4, but if you
could maybe give us some sense of what the major moving parts are. I think we have about $2 billion in
China revenue round numbers, an approximately kind of an annual run rate there. Obviously, it's a moving
target, but things like -- would an impact in Q4 likely, based on what you know now, sort of come back in
early Q -- how transitory is that impact? And then on Spyral, just maybe walk through for us the time line
of what happens after OFF-MED and what that looks like as you continue to develop that program.

Omar S. Ishrak
Chairman & CEO

Okay. Let me take the coronavirus question first. First of all, we're pretty clear about what our China
business is. It's roughly 7% of our global business, so you can do the estimate there. The variables right
now -- one variable is that we've got to get our factories up and running so that we can supply different
places in the world, including China, and that is actually progressing well. But the main factor driving the
number there will be the procedure uptake in China. China was in a complete shutdown mode for the
first half of February, and they're just beginning to start. And even now, even in places like Beijing and
others, procedures are only just beginning. It's too early to tell how they will ramp up through the rest of
the quarter. We know that in Hubei province, for example, obviously, it shut down, but that's only 5% of
China. But the rest of China, in places like Beijing and Shanghai, right now, there are procedure delays.

In addition to that, a lot of physicians are being asked to actually go and help with the virus. And so there
are many dynamics here that are really difficult to predict now. Once things stabilize, there could well be
a ramp back up. And because people need the procedures, they will get them at some point. When that
happens is very difficult to predict right now. So that's why we're saying that wait until a little later in the
quarter when we have some more data and see how things progress and we'll give you a full update.

So with that, I'm going to ask Mike to take the renal.

Michael J. Coyle
Executive VP and Group President of Cardiac & Vascular Group

So our renal denervation, obviously, the first big milestone will be the pivotal trial on the OFF-MED, which
will be presented here at ACC. But there is the second trial that is ongoing in parallel, which is the ON MED
trial. Unlike the OFF-MED, it has a 6-month efficacy endpoint. So if I were to set expectations for when
those data were to become available, I would expect that about a year from now, so about this time next
year.

In terms of the FDA interaction, the ON MED -- or the OFF-MED data will be used in a modular submission
as we -- along with, obviously, the device-supporting materials. So we think we can get the process with
FDA to move forward. We do think we need the OFF-MED -- or excuse me, the ON MED dataset in order

to get final approval for the product, and certainly, it will be very important in terms of reimbursement to
have those data. So that would be how I would set expectations.

Obviously, I think you know the Spyral product is available in Europe currently. It does have CE mark. So
as these datasets become available, customers can evaluate them and decide how they want to use that
product.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.

Christopher Thomas Pasquale
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Mike, I just want to circle back on the 4Q CVG growth outlook. It sounds like some of the headwinds
there, like LVADs and TAVR, may take at least another quarter to address. I'd imagine that there's
potentially some risk that U.S. ICD growth slows ahead of those launches, just like we saw in Europe. So
Micra AV should help. There's a couple of other things that go your way, which is the confidence in driving
that acceleration in the fourth quarter.

Michael J. Coyle
Executive VP and Group President of Cardiac & Vascular Group

Sure. I think as you point out, we have lowered our expectations for the LVAD numbers just based on
not seeing the sequential share capture in Q3 that we had seen in Q2 and some competitive indications
approvals. But on the other hand, obviously, we got the Micra AV early in terms of we expected that it will
be later in the quarter when we were setting guidance last quarter. And the customer response has been
strong in terms of interest in the technology.

And as a reminder, this is a product that carries a 3x price uplift relative to a standard dual-chamber
system and our indications for use cover all AV block patients. So we expect an opportunity to drive this
product meaningfully into the market above what we were thinking a quarter ago when we were giving
guidance for Q4.

In addition, although, obviously, the Cobalt and Crome products won't be in the U.S., they will be in
Europe. And so unlike last quarter where we really had no meaningful new products and we saw the
customers pausing and -- while waiting for new products, now we have a number of new products globally
that are obviously going to make a difference for us. And so net-net, we're pretty much holding our
expectations for growth where we were a quarter ago despite the moving pieces in this quarter.

Christopher Thomas Pasquale
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

And does the guidance contemplate a pause in U.S. ICD orders ahead of those launches?

Michael J. Coyle
Executive VP and Group President of Cardiac & Vascular Group

Yes, it certainly shows no meaningful acceleration in those numbers, so something along the lines of what
we've had. But as I said, we're also seeing some improvement in the replacement cycle generally because
of the CRT-D side of things. And the other thing I should mention is, obviously, we will anniversary in
March the paclitaxel issue, which was a big step down in the prior year quarter, which gives us just an
easier comp to work with as we've seen sequential growth on a selling days basis the last couple of
quarters in DCB.

have sequential growth over the quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.

Philip Chickering
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

To follow up on Robbie's question on U.S. TAVR. I understand the sales rep issues are holding back growth
of new accounts. But are the sales reps really holding back growth in established accounts? Is that where
the growth is falling? Is it from the new accounts or from the established accounts?

Michael J. Coyle
Executive VP and Group President of Cardiac & Vascular Group

Yes. It's a great question. Actually, what happened was there was a tremendous focus on launching the
Evolut PRO+ as well as opening up the NCD accounts. And what we wound up doing because of the
relative immaturity of a good bit of our field force is pulling reps who are supporting large accounts to help
with that expansion into new accounts.

And obviously, with a new competitor entering the market and some complex messaging having to come
in as low-risk patients were approved, it just proved to be too much. We were spreading our field too
thin. And so obviously, we've refocused back into those large accounts to make sure that our messaging
around improved hemodynamics, the benefits of the Evolut PRO+ in terms of both profile and now adding
the pericardial wrap into the large device segment and then, obviously, just selling the benefits of the
hemodynamic data that was presented at ACC a year ago. Those are things now that we believe are
helping to show this acceleration in growth that I referenced as we head into this quarter versus where we
were in January.

of these things on the top line? Is there going to be better pricing so there could be a little bit of gross
margin pressure longer term, so there's some free cash flow impacts here? So just how do we think about
some of the puts and takes here of this new program?

Geoffrey Straub Martha
President & Director

Yes. Well, look, I didn't -- just one clarification on what I spoke about. I think this is the second question
around will some of these changes impact our margins. And the answer to that is no, right? We're talking
about focus on increasing our revenue and the overall revenue growth as well as the consistency and
predictability of that revenue growth, but we don't want to take a step back on the margin improvement
that we've built up and the cash flow conversion improvements that we had done over the last couple of
years as a result of our -- these are sustainable changes from our Enterprise Excellence Program so we
don't want to take a step back on that.

What I mentioned this morning -- on this morning's call was the very specific changes that we want to
make to improve orders that are coming in late in the quarter. We have a couple of our larger orders,
some of our -- coming in late in the quarter, which stresses our system, and we've got to execute better
really to get those in earlier. We're putting too much pressure on the last month, and that's specifically
what I spoke of this morning. And when I hinted at for Investor Day was more on what are we doing to
realize the full benefits of the pipeline.

Look, like the fundamentals of the business are strong. What I mean by that specifically, you guys know
the markets are doing well, we have good market share positions. But more importantly in terms of
momentum, the product pipeline is coming to fruition here. So we need to make sure that we put the right
programs in place to realize the full benefits of that pipeline around commercial execution. So that's --
we'll get into more of that on Investor Day. What I talked about this morning was more having a regular
-- moving some of our back-end loading of our quarter and spreading that more evenly throughout the
quarter, but nothing regarding -- nothing changed regarding margin.

gross margin is the increase in China tariff, and as long as those stay, that will be a continued pressure.
Gross margin is obviously impacted by mix. And as we introduce some of our key new products, that
should help gross margin going forward.

And as we think about the net other expense or income line item, we had a benefit this quarter. That was
primarily driven by a swap program that we have in place to hedge the gains and losses that are part of
our deferred compensation program and SG& A. And so it was really driven by that. Our SG&A line would
have been even better if it didn't have a loss that was effectively offset by a gain in net other.
