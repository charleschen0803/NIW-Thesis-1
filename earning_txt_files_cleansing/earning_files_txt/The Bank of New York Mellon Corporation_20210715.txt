THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the 2021 second quarter earnings conference call hosted by BNY Mellon.
[Operator Instructions]

Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material.
You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.

I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Marius Merz
Head of Investor Relations

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the BNY Mellon's Second Quarter 2021
Earnings Conference Call. Today, we will reference our financial highlights presentation available on the
Investor Relations page of our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon's CEO, will lead the
call. Then Emily Portney, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation. Following Emily's
prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session.

Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP
measures. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings
press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor
Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July
15, 2021, and will not be updated.

With that, I will hand it over to Todd.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Thank you, Marius, and good morning, everyone. Now I'm going to touch on a few of the highlights before
I hand it over to Emily, and she'll review our second quarter financial results and the outlook for the
second half of the year in more detail.

So if we refer to Slide 2 of the financial highlights presentation. We reported EPS of $1.13. That's on $4
billion of revenue. And we generated a return on tangible common equity of 19%. Fee revenue was up 4%
year-over-year, and it was up 10% excluding the impact of money market fee waivers.

Average deposits were down 1% quarter-over-quarter. This, together with strong capital generation, drove
an approximately 20 basis point increase in our Tier 1 leverage ratio. And we are pleased with the results
of this year's supervisory stress tests, which once again demonstrated the resilience of our business model
and the strength of our balance sheet even under severe stress. And we also welcomed the Fed's decision
to lift the recent restrictions on common stock dividends and share repurchases at the end of June.

Now taking a step back for a look at the broader operating environment. We continue to be impacted by
the significant amount of excess cash in the system. We welcomed the Fed's decision to raise the IOER
and the overnight reverse repo rate by 5 basis points last month. That provided a bit of support to short-
term rates, although they continue to be exceptionally low by historical standards.

Money market funds' take-up of the Fed's reverse repo facility increased from approximately $500 billion
prior to the Fed's action to north of $750 billion, and they actually spiked to almost $1 trillion at quarter
end. This means that somewhere between 15% and 20% of total U.S. money market fund assets are
being parked at the Fed, earning 5 basis points. Now given the significant amount of excess cash in the
system and the expectation for further Fed balance sheet expansion, bank balance sheets will continue to
be under pressure, but money market funds may provide some relief.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Now let's turn to a few highlights across the franchise, and I'll start with Asset Servicing. In Asset
Servicing, we continue to see good momentum as clients increasingly transform their operating models
and are looking to us for open, modular front-to-back solutions, including our leading Data and Analytics
solutions that they can build their own businesses on. As an example, we were awarded new business
from Lockheed Martin, and it was led by Asset Servicing but it really leveraged our capabilities across the
enterprise.

We were awarded custody and a full suite of related services as Lockheed was looking to consolidate
providers across custody and hedge fund administration. This large corporate asset owner win
demonstrates the power of our OMNI offering to bring a wide breadth of services, which includes Data and
Analytics, leading FinTech partnerships and other capabilities from across the enterprise together, which
happened to differentiate us from our competitors in this process.

We also continue to drive innovation in digital assets. We are excited to have recently been mandated
by Grayscale, that's the world's largest digital currency asset manager to provide fund accounting and
administrative services for the Bitcoin Trust. Once conversion to an ETF is SEC approved, we will be able
to service the product as an ETF as well while also providing our unique transfer agency and ETF basket-
creation services. On ETF more broadly, we continue to see good momentum in ETF servicing with ETF
AUC/A reaching $1.1 trillion at the end of June, and we've now helped to launch over 100 ETFs year-to-
date.

We've also continued to strengthen our capabilities through additional partnerships with leading FinTechs,
and last week, we announced the acquisition of Milestone. This acquisition will help us advance the
digitization and automation of core accounting and asset servicing capabilities. If you recall, roughly
about a year ago, we formed an elite alliance with Milestone to address an industry need for greater fund
oversight and resiliency. Following on the success of this alliance, we saw an opportunity to build on the
strategic relationship and further our capabilities in OCIO services, cash allocation and fair value controls.
I'd also like to highlight our recently announced partnerships with Saphyre and Evisort because both are
terrific examples of how we are using open architecture to automate and digitize operations, improve the
client experience and driving efficiencies.

Moving on to our Markets Infrastructure businesses. Pershing had another strong quarter, benefiting from
equity market strength and continued strong underlying fundamentals. The number of clearing accounts
continues to grow at a healthy clip. And we saw strong net new asset flows, and the sales pipeline there
remains robust.

In May, we reshaped Pershing's operating model into 2 segments: Institutional Solutions and Wealth
Solutions. And we did that to organize around our clients and align our expertise to best serve their
needs. Aligning around these 2 segments enables us to focus our people, tech investments and process
improvements to fuel growth.

Institutional Solutions serves capital markets firms, investment banks, hedge funds and alternative
investment managers. Pershing's institutional platform provides clients with a single seamless experience
backed by the strength and scale of BNY Mellon, offering financing, collateral management, global trade
execution, securities lending and syndicate capabilities.

Now Wealth Solutions addresses the evolving and converging needs of our wealth-minded broker-dealer
and RIA clients by delivering improved lending, digitized account opening and streamlined asset transfers.
Given the rapid growth in the wealth advisory segment, we are making significant new investments to
further build out our advisory capabilities.

In Markets, we were able to offset some of the headwinds from meaningfully lower volatility and
narrowing spreads by growing our client volumes significantly, reflecting the success of the initiatives
we've put in place to strengthen our capabilities and improve client targeting across our Investment
Services business. In fact, last week, Euromoney ranked us #1 in 18 categories of its 2021 FX survey. And
for the first time, we claimed the #1 spot as “Real Money Overall Market” leader globally.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

In Treasury Services, we saw strong growth in quarterly payment volumes compared to the prior year.
And the business experienced healthy client wins in payments, liquidity and trade across all geographic
regions. In June, we introduced cross-currency sweeps, the latest addition to our rapidly expanding
liquidity management product suite, and earlier in May, we launched the first-of-its-kind real-time e-bill
and payment solution that we talked about in the past.

We're the first bank leveraging the New York Clearinghouse's real-time payments network to provide
corporations with an instant digital consumer bill pay service. And today, we're actively collaborating with
multiple billers and retail banks to drive the adoption of this new functionality. Our production pilots will
continue this year, and we're planning to scale them more broadly into 2022.

In Investment Management, we had our fifth consecutive quarter of net inflows into long-term products.
We continue to see strong net inflows in cash products, and we ended the quarter with record AUM. We've
been making good progress in our realignment to transfer Mellon capabilities in fixed income, equity and
multi-asset and liquidity management to Insight, Newton and Dreyfus Cash, respectively. And that was --
the purpose is to bring specialist investment capabilities at scale, and we remain on track for completion of
this in the third quarter.

We're pleased to see that we're already starting to drive efficiencies, and feedback from clients and
industry consultants has been quite positive. And last month Euan Munro joined us as the new Head
of Newton. Euan brings 3 decades of experience with a proven track record in the investment industry,
including extensive experience leading one of the U.K.'s largest asset managers with a presence in
institutional, intermediary and retail markets.

And finally, in Wealth Management, we saw another quarter of strong client asset flows, and client assets
exceeded $300 billion for the first time. The Financial Times named BNY Mellon the “Best Private Bank for
Digital Wealth Planning in North America”, and they are recognizing there our Wealth Online client portal
and our proprietary goals-based planning tool we call AdvicePath.

Taken together, we're pleased with the increased momentum that we're seeing across the franchise, which
is resulting in organic fee growth in excess of our 1.5% outlook for the year. Our strong performance in
the first half of the year and significant capital generation have put us in a position to further accelerate
investments in a number of meaningful growth and modernization opportunities in the second half.

Now before I turn it over to Emily to review our second quarter results and the outlook for the second
half of the year in more detail, I'd like to provide a quick update on our plans for the return to the office
and the future of the workplace. Starting in September, we're planning to begin safely opening our offices
around the world, although dates and details may vary by location as we continue to monitor and as
conditions evolve. We believe that in the process, we have an opportunity to create a new and better way
of working that makes us feel more connected, balanced and productive while maintaining flexibility. The
majority of our almost 50,000 colleagues around the world will therefore follow a hybrid model that allows
for a flexible mix of remote and in-person experiences going forward.

With that, I'll hand it over to Emily.

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the
quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.

Beginning on Page 3. Total revenue was lower by 1% due to lower net interest revenue and higher money
market fee waivers, partially offset by strong fee growth. Fee revenue grew 4% or 10% excluding the
impact of fee waivers. This reflects the positive impact of higher market values, the favorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar and higher client activity. Other revenue was $91 million and included approximately
$30 million of investment disposal and other income gains. Net interest revenue was down 17%.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Expenses increased 3% with about 2/3 driven by the weaker U.S. dollar. Provision for credit losses was
a benefit of $86 million, driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast. EPS was $1.13, and
pretax margin was 32%.

Moving to Page 4, which shows a trend analysis of the main drivers of our quarterly results. Investment
Services revenue was $3 billion, down 4% year-on-year, mainly driven by lower net interest revenue
and higher fee waivers. Excluding fee waivers, Investment Services fee and other revenue was up 5%,
reflecting increased client activity and organic growth in assets from existing clients, higher liquidity
balances and market levels and the benefit of the weaker U.S. dollar.

Investment and Wealth Management revenue of $1 billion increased 13% as higher market values and
the benefit of the weaker U.S. dollar more than offset the impact of fee waivers. Excluding fee waivers,
fee and other revenue was up 21%. Money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense
were $252 million in the quarter, up $64 million from the prior quarter, which impacted pretax income by
approximately $40 million sequentially. Higher waivers were driven by lower T-bill and repo rates as well
as higher average balances.

Turning to Page 5. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong and well above internal targets and
regulatory minimums. Our CET1 ratio was 12.6%, flat to Q1 under the standardized approach. And our
Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is our binding capital constraint, was 6%, up approximately 20 basis points
sequentially due to net capital generation and a 2% quarter-over-quarter decrease in average assets.
Average deposit balances declined by 1% as we've been successful at curtailing deposit growth by working
with our clients to move excess deposits to off-balance-sheet vehicles, namely money market funds, which
were up roughly 9% sequentially, outpacing the industry. Finally, our LCR was 110%, flat to the prior
quarter.

Turning to Page 6. My comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Q2 net
interest revenue was $645 million, down 1.5%. The decrease was largely driven by the impact of lower
short-term rates, continued elevated prepayment speeds and lower reinvestment yields.

Turning to Page 7, which provides some color on deposits and our securities portfolio trends and mix. As
mentioned, average deposit balances declined by a little over $3 billion sequentially despite the Fed adding
$360 billion of liquidity into the system through its bond purchase program and the Treasury General
Account having declined by about $300 billion in the quarter. Our deposits remained elevated versus
a year ago, up $42 billion or 15%. We estimate that a portion of this growth is excess in nature and is
expected to run off when rates rise.

Turning to the securities portfolio. On average, the portfolio was flat to the first quarter and up
approximately $7 million or 5% over the prior year. Average loans increased about 7% both sequentially
and year-over-year, with growth primarily driven by Pershing margin loans, Wealth Management
collateralized loans and capital call financing as well as term secured loans to global financial institutions.

Turning to Page 8. As I mentioned earlier, expenses of approximately $2.8 billion for the quarter were
higher by 3% versus the prior year, with about 2/3 of the increase driven by the unfavorable impact of
the weaker U.S. dollar. The remainder was primarily driven by volume and revenue-related expenses and
investments in efficiency and growth initiatives.

Turning to Page 9. Total revenue in the Investment Services segment declined by 4% versus the prior
year. FX revenue in Investment Services declined 7% year-over-year, driven by lower volatility and
spreads, partially offset by strong growth in client volumes. On a sequential basis, FX revenue declined
21% on lower volumes especially in emerging markets, lower spreads and volatility. Assets under custody
and/or administration increased by 21% year-over-year to $45 trillion, driven by higher market levels, net
new business and a favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar.

As I discuss the Investment Services businesses, I will focus my comments on total fees in each business.
Within the Asset Servicing line of business, we saw growth on the back of higher client activity and market
levels, which more than offset lower FX revenue. The growth was offset by a roughly 400 basis point
impact from fee waivers.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Fees in Pershing were up, reflecting higher market levels and solid organic growth, partially offset by
higher fee waivers and lower transaction volumes compared to an exceptional quarter a year ago. Clearing
accounts were up 6%, mutual fund assets were up 33%, and we saw continued strong net asset flows of
$40 billion in the quarter. Waivers impacted fee growth by approximately 800 basis points.

Fees in Issuer Services had underlying growth in DRs, which saw resumption of client issuance and
dividend activity to pre-COVID levels as well as in Corporate Trust on the back of higher CLO, MTN and
mortgage refi activity. This growth was offset by the impact of fee waivers in Corporate Trust. Treasury
Services fees were up 11%, driven by higher payment volumes and a continued shift to higher-margin
products. In fact, on June 30, the business processed a record $3.2 trillion in U.S. dollar payments.

Finally, Clearing and Collateral Management fees were down slightly as continued strength in collateral
management was offset by lower clearance volumes and lower intraday financing fees. Elevated levels of
U.S. money fund AUM and international demand for HQLA collateral are both providing long-term tailwinds
for our Collateral Management business. Page 10 summarizes the key drivers that affect the year-over-
year revenue comparisons for each of our Investment Services businesses.

Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 11. Total investment in Wealth Management
revenues increased 13% versus the prior year. Assets under management grew to a record $2.3 trillion,
up 18% year-over-year, primarily due to higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S.
dollar principally versus the British pound and net client inflows. We had net inflows of $25 billion in the
second quarter, driven by LDI, fixed income and cash strategies. As Todd said, this is our fifth consecutive
quarter of long-term inflows.

Investment Management revenue grew 13% due to higher market values, the benefit of a weaker U.S.
dollar, higher performance fees and net inflows despite a 9% negative impact from fee waivers. Wealth
Management revenue also grew 13% due to higher market values, investment performance and growth
in collateralized loans. Client assets in Wealth Management were a record $305 billion, up 20% year-over-
year. Page 12 includes the results of the other segments.

I'll conclude with a few comments about the outlook. As we think about the second half of 2021, based
on the current forward curve, we now expect NIR on a full year basis to be down approximately 14%
compared to 2020. Also using the forward curve and assuming flat balances, we estimate fee waivers, net
of distribution and servicing expense, to be approximately $225 million in the third quarter, slightly better
than the $252 million this quarter, driven by the slightly higher short-term rate outlook. This is estimated
to have a modest pretax benefit of $15 million next quarter.

With regard to fees ex waivers, recall that we guided at year-end for growth to be about 3%. Given the
strong first half of this year, we now expect full year fees ex waivers to be up between 7% and 8%.

On expenses, we now expect the full year to be up closer to 4%, excluding notable items. Approximately
half of the year-over-year growth is expected to be related to currency, and the other half is pretty
evenly split over higher volume and revenue-related expenses and incremental investments in a number
of attractive growth and efficiency opportunities. We still expect our full year effective tax rate to be
approximately 19%.

And with respect to capital return, our Board just declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per share for the third
quarter, representing an approximately 10% increase; and authorized up to $6 billion of common stock
repurchases over the next 6 quarters through the end of 2022. Considering the $2 billion of excess capital
that we've accumulated and the significant amount of capital that we're generating, we expect to buy back
well in excess of 100% of our earnings in the near term. And remember, the SCB framework allows for
additional capital actions over time if and when appropriate, subject to additional authorization by our
Board.
With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Thanks for taking away like 17 of my questions with that outlook. That was helpful. I guess a follow-up on
the expense question. So if you look at year-on-year, it was up 3%. I heard your guide. It was -- expenses
were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. Can we talk about the growth opportunity piece you mentioned?

What growth opportunities are you investing in? And what kind of payback can we expect? How do you
think about that given your huge excess capital? I'm just -- my real question is why not invest more. So
that's where I'm going with it.

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

It's a great question, Glenn. Thank you. So as you have rightfully pointed out, we have been
extraordinarily disciplined on expenses, and we've actually held them flat over the course of the last 4
years.

Everything that we're talking about here are investments in growth and efficiency. Just to name a
few, so certainly, digital assets and all the things we've talked about around digital assets, Data and
Analytics, advisory services in Pershing as well as the managed account space. I'd highlight also electronic
payment and collection services in Treasury Services. And then the remainder would be modernizing and
automating our -- both our risk management and our operations infrastructure.

And really, as you alluded to, we had a very strong half. We have a very strong capital-generative model.
There are interesting opportunities. All of these have been properly vetted and truly will drive incremental
growth and efficiency. So we feel now is an important time to invest.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Glenn, are you still there? I think we lost you.

Glenn Paul Schorr
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Oh, yes. Sorry about that. I appreciate all that, Emily. Maybe just a quick follow-up on Pershing.

So in the past, you spoke about some -- maybe some headwinds in the second half. Are you able to
quantify that just to give us that heads up on what to expect in the second half? And maybe at the high
level, talk about the competitive backdrop there because it seems like some -- yet another competitor is
poking their nose and trying to get involved on RIA clearing side.

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. I can start, and I'm sure Todd can add. Just in terms of the impact of the lost business that we had
talked about in the past, it's going to be about $20 million per quarter going forward. And that is, by the
way, Glenn, baked into the forecast. So that is embedded in there.

And yes, it is a competitive space. And actually, that particular piece of business that we're talking about
was really we were on the wrong side of some M&A activity. So we do -- although we see a lot of growth
and a lot of opportunity, there's certainly further consolidation as well.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. And I would add that the consolidation that we've seen is actually a positive for us. So we've got a
very robust pipeline. We continue to add a significant number of accounts over the course of the quarter
and as well as seeing significant growth in funds. And we think there's opportunity to actually invest more.

So what we did this quarter is we actually separated the businesses into 2. One is the institutional side,
where we have some unique capabilities with some very large clients and we've got some pretty good
leads there that we're excited about. But also, on the advisory and the broker-dealer side, we think we
can invest there and garner some more of what's a very fast-growing industry.

There is some competition there, but the consolidation has also provided some opportunity for us. So we
do get -- every now and then, you get a lumpy loss due to an M&A. We've looked at it over history. That
really -- it hasn't changed. We probably won more than we've lost, but we have pointed out that will have
an impact in the third quarter.

Operator

Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.

James Francis Mitchell
Seaport Research Partners

Can you speak to your efforts on deposits? It seems like you had some success keeping deposits flat to
down. Is that deliberate efforts on your part with less demand for your balance sheet? Maybe you could
just speak to the deposit growth in the quarter and how you think about it going forward.

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. I'll take that. So you're right, we have been proactively managing deposits and very successfully.
We've been working with our clients, and you can see that in our trends. So despite the Fed and --
continuing to pump excess liquidity into the system, ultimately, we have managed our deposits and
they're down 1% sequentially. This has been very much a coordinated effort with our salespeople and our
clients.

And in terms of looking at what's excess on our balance sheet, we probably think we have about $25
billion to $50 billion that's still excess. But what we have been doing is looking at what is excess and
actually working with our clients to move it to off-balance-sheet vehicles such as money market funds.
That's partially why you see a 9% growth in our money market fund balances that were driving waivers.

And we're fortunate, too, in that we have a very robust liquidity solutions business. We offer both in-
house as well as third-party solutions, and that has been certainly very attractive to our clients as we've
endeavored to manage the balance sheet. And look, going forward, we will continue to do that. It's --
we're comfortable where we are, but certainly, we will continue to do that considering there still will likely
be more liquidity coming into the system.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Jim, it's a very disciplined process that Emily leads along with the salespeople and treasury function. And
we look at it client by client. And the good news is we've been able to capture most of that in our money
market funds or our Liquidity Direct offerings.

And so we are gaining market share there. And we've got a little bit of benefit when the Fed did increase
the interest rate on excess reserves and the reverse repo. That have made that alternative -- they
provided a bit of an outlet. So we think even though the Fed will probably continue to provide liquidity and
build their balance sheet, that we should be able to manage it.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Seaport Research Partners

Right. No, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up to that, if you think -- you've had success on the
leverage ratio. When we think about the buyback that you're targeting over the next 18 months, can you
front-load that? How do we think about the cadence of buybacks?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Sure. Emily?

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So certainly, the cadence of buybacks is going to be determined by lots of different factors:
our capital position, our forward outlook for earnings, et cetera. But you can definitely assume that
considering we have about $2 billion of excess capital now, and that's just against our binding constraint
of Tier 1 leverage. Frankly, we have more excess capital when you actually think about what a normalized
balance sheet size probably is when some of those excess deposits recede. So assuming -- taking that
into account, taking into account the fact that we've also committed to our shareholders that we will
return 100% of earnings over time, it's safe to assume that we'll probably front-load that $6 billion of
authorization that we've received from the Board.

Operator

Next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So maybe just starting with the NIR guide for the back half. It looks like the amount continues to kind
of grind lower a little bit, and maybe given what the forward curve has done relative to last quarter, not
particularly surprising. But curious if you guys feel like most of the pain is now in the run rate. Is this the
right sort of jumping off point to think about as we sort of start to pencil out into 2022?

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So I hesitate to call it trough because every time we do it, it's not accurate. But in terms of just our
forward -- our outlook, we just use the forward curve when we project NIR. We don't try to get cute.

Short-term rates are a bit lower in the forward curve than they were a couple of months ago. Likewise,
as you all have seen, the long end has come down and the curve is flattening. And likewise, in terms of
prepayment speeds, they have been elevated. And although we do expect them to slow down by the end
of the year, they're probably going to still be more elevated than we had originally anticipated. So all of
those things are just baked into the 14% down year-on-year.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. A couple of things. I mean one of the key drivers is -- are the short-term rates when you look at
LIBOR and obviously, when you look at the Fed funds rate or the IOER. So the fact that, that has stabilized
and it stabilized a bit in the forward curve, at least out the next 6 months or so, so the downside drag to
that from where we are is probably not likely to be much unless something else were to change.

And then we're going to have to look at the impact of term rates as we do reprice assets as they come
out of the investment portfolio. But our best guess right now is we're pretty close to the trough. And as
we think through money market fee waivers, it does feel like the support in the reverse repo program has
probably bottomed that out.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Chief Financial Officer

Yes.

Alexander Blostein
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Great. That's helpful. I was hoping to dig through a couple of business line items as well. Maybe just
focusing on Asset Servicing for a second.

It seems like the business is seeing pretty decent momentum here. When I sort of back out money market
fee waivers from the Asset Servicing line, it looks like it was up 2% quarter-on-quarter, 7% year-over-
year, so -- despite obviously moderating industry volumes backdrop. Can you help us bridge maybe what
sort of the source of growth here are sequentially?

And as we're sort of thinking ahead over the next sort of 12 to 18 months, what do you expect to be the
bigger contributors to growth here? I know there's a bunch of things that sort of go in there, right? There's
the custody and admin business, but then there's also tri-party repo and a couple of other things.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. So let me start with the more traditional custody business. I think we are having quite a bit of
success there. We've got -- we won a couple of very nice mandates this year. Our sales growth is ahead
of where it's been. The ETF business is growing very nicely. We captured -- it's up significantly on a year-
over-year basis. Our capabilities there are quite good.

In our venture with CIBC Mellon, we've actually won 11 of the 16 ETFs that have been listed on the TSC
(sic) [ TSX ]. And so we're seeing healthy growth there. We've got about 100 opportunities in our digital
asset space, so that is getting some traction. And we've got really good flows across a number of our
existing organic flows with our existing clients. So it's a combination of all of that, Alex.

Operator

Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

I'd like to start with the balance sheet. You touched on the estimate of excess deposits. That was really
helpful. Curious about what drove though, on the funding cost side, the improvement quarter-over-
quarter.

Was there any noise in that? Or do you think that's sustainable? And then when we think about squaring
the guide for balances, what are you assuming for deposit growth from here for the rest of the year?

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So just on the funding side, really, there was a benefit of also lower rates there. So that was what
was driving it. Nothing else really notable.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. A lot of our debt is swapped to floating. So as we saw lower LIBOR, we saw that -- through that as
well.

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Exactly. And then I think the other question was -- what was the second part of the question?

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

About balance sheet growth.

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Oh, balance sheet growth, yes. We -- similar to what I had alluded to before, we will continue to monitor
and proactively manage the balance sheet. We do have room should deposits go up further. But of course,
like I said, based on the excess that we have, we'd like to kind of stay where we are and frankly, manage
it down further.

Brennan Hawken
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And then when we think about servicing -- the servicing revenue, and Alex touched on this a
little, what was the contribution of activity this quarter? What was the benefit of new business?

Was there some -- did that come in late in the quarter from a -- I know we -- it's an imperfect way to
model, but the way we all model this, it looks that the fee rate got hit this quarter. So what were some of
the dynamics there? And how should we be thinking about that going forward?

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

I mean if you're talking about like Asset Servicing versus AUC/A, which I think is kind of what you're
alluding to, AUC/A was up 8% sequentially. It's about 1 -- 1/3 of that was market and currency driven,
and the remainder was really organic growth. So some really good signs of organic growth.

When you look at that though against asset servicing fees and revenues, like when we think about it, it's
generally helpful, rather than look at the 8%, to probably look at the spot -- sorry, rather than look at the
spot, to look at the average growth in AUC/A, which was about 5%. And then when you look at the Asset
Servicing fee line, it was flat. But ex waivers, it was up 2%.

And actually, as we've kind of reminded folks in the past, when we look -- asset servicing fees, only 50%
or so are truly driven by asset levels. The remainder are driven by account-based fees and transaction
fees. So hopefully, that helps.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. When you get under it all, if you look at really what is the organic growth rate underneath -- across
the businesses, especially in the Investment Services business, when we look at fees only, if you exclude
market appreciation or depreciation, the currency impact, waivers and some of the extraordinary volumes
that we had in the second quarter of last year due to COVID, that's -- if you net that out and net the
fee waivers out, we're seeing probably something like 2% or slightly better than 2% in the core organic
growth.

Operator

Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Emily, on the fee side, ex waivers, you talked about the improvement on your outlook to plus 7%, 8%
from plus 3%. And I'm just wondering how much of that was just a pull-through of the first half, as you
mentioned and/or if you are actually more confident in what you're seeing in some of the core businesses,
following on the last few questions, about the underlying growth that you are seeing in other fee areas.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Chief Financial Officer

Sure. So ultimately, the 7% to 8% is fees, ex waiver, growth over the course of -- year-on-year. So if --
you have some of the numbers to do the math. In the first half, we had about 8% growth. In the second
half, it will still be very, very healthy but probably closer to 7%.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. All right. So it was more of just how good it's been and then stays is the way to think about it.

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Exactly.

Kenneth Michael Usdin
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Okay. Got it. And just coming back to the -- you laid out a lot of new product intros. You've been talking
about this for a while. I guess the challenge for us is to understand how these product intros turn into
revenues and the time frame by which they do convert.

And you've talked about the organic growth improving directionally over time. But how do -- how quickly
can we start to see some of these improvements and new intros really starting to roll into the income
statement? And are there other ones that you can give examples of, which -- where they're live and now
starting to be meaningful contributors?

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Sure, Ken. So as we've described in the past, if you looked at our organic growth over the past few years
before last year, it was basically flat. And so now we are starting to see -- we're starting to get some
traction as we've improved a number of our services, invested in our Data and Analytics capabilities. And
we've talked about our digital assets capability.

So we're already starting to see some benefit in these numbers now that we're seeing an underlying
growth rate of more like 2%. We're already starting to see some benefit to things like our custody and ETF
servicing business around some of the digital assets. Our investments in the ETF business is starting to
come through and show up in the numbers a bit. Some of the longer-term investments that we're looking
to make like Pershing, where we're really investing in the platform, we don't expect that to really turn into
revenues for as long as 2 years. So it's -- some of these are very -- are longer term, and some of them
are coming through as we talk about them.

On the Treasury Services side, where you see us gaining some market share and we've had pretty healthy
organic growth there, the multicurrency sweeps, it's caught a lot of attention when we announced that.
We have clients in it today, and we think that will gain some traction over the next year or so. And I would
say the same thing with what we're doing with real-time payments and collections.

So it's -- we've mapped it out. It's kind of all over the board. Some of them are as far as 2 or 3 years out.
Some of the investments that we're making in custody, we would expect to have a return maybe a year
out. And some of them are starting to bump into and help us generate a positive organic growth rate of
the 2% that we're seeing today.

Operator

And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Just want to come back to the AUC/A up to $45 trillion from the $41.7 trillion. You mentioned about 2/3
of that was organic. Can you parse that out a bit between organic from the client base in terms of net
inflows at your clients? It seems like $2 trillion is a large number. So I just wanted to sort of understand
new business won by BNY Mellon versus the underlying client growth.

And then, if you can also comment on the demand for cryptocurrency servicing. Obviously, you have the
Grayscale mandate, which is great. Are you seeing an increase in that demand in the second quarter
versus what -- I know that began to spike up in the first quarter.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Okay. So Brian, when you look at our flows and the growth on a year-over-year basis, about half of it
is flows that would include net new, new business, and it would also include any lost business and any
organic flows from existing clients. So hooking on some winners, as they do -- as they generate new
funds, that would be new business for us. And then the combination -- a little more than half is market
and currency, and the rest of it is coming from the client flows.

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

I'm sorry, I meant on a sequential basis, from $41.7 trillion to $45 trillion.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Okay. On a sequential basis, that number is -- it's pretty similar. It's probably...

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Actually, a bit more. On the sequential basis, it's about -- more of it is based on net new business than
currency and markets than it was year-on-year.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Yes. It's about 50-50, not quite. And then you asked a question around demand for Bitcoin services. And
what we have mentioned earlier, we have initiated quite a few ETFs in Canada where they can be traded
on the TSC (sic) [ SEC ]. So we've got 11 of the 16 ETFs that exist there and there is activity there.

And Grayscale, which is the largest asset manager of digital currencies, we've teamed up and partnered
with them, both to help them with the existing trust and when and if they get approval from the SEC to
list the ETFs, they'll take on our TA and other capabilities there as well. So we are seeing some interest.
And then we're also seeing some interest in -- on, what I'd say, the high net worth side. So there is some
retail interest that we're hearing through some of the Pershing clients as well as other Wealth Management
players.

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

It's worth just adding to that, that we have been mandated on the 6 of the 13 filings that is out there.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

For the U.S.

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Yes, in the U.S. that are in front of the SEC now.

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Brian Bertram Bedell
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division

Okay, okay. That's great. And then just a quick follow-up on the assumptions for NIR and the money
market fund fee waivers. Just you mentioned trying to move more of those excess deposits into money
market funds. Just in the assumptions of the guidance that you gave, are you assuming some of that
transfer from those excess deposits in terms of both the fee waivers moving down, which would be good if
you were expecting an increase in money market fund balances?

And then same with the balance sheet side. As we move into year-end, given that guidance, is there an
assumption of conversion of deposits to money market fund balances within that guidance?

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Sure. I'll take both. And I'm sure Todd will chime in. On the waiver side, really we're just using the forward
curve, and we're just assuming balances stay flat.

As we just -- as we talked about a little bit before, the Fed actually taking some action with technical rates
and raising the repo rate by -- the reverse repo rate by 5 basis points has been extraordinarily helpful,
and that has put a bit of a floor in terms of gross fund yield. And so that is largely what's driving the
improvement that we expect in the second quarter from a run rate of about 200 -- what was 250 this
quarter to about $225 million.

So in terms of going forward, of course, as we start to recoup some of that, it's very dependent upon --
obviously, it will be very dependent upon balance levels, but that's going to be some time in the future.
From a deposit perspective, we're -- as I mentioned before, we have a material amount of excess still on
the balance sheet. We're fine in terms of where we are, but yes, we'd like to manage that down a bit.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

So Brian, what I would add to that is -- so yes, we're projecting that those balances are going to come
down a little bit in the number for NIR. And you got to remember, when we had all this excess capital and
there was nothing we can do about it. It wasn't particularly in our interest to push those balances away
because they did make up -- even though it was modest, they did make a little bit of incremental income
but the return on capital was very poor. So now that we have the flexibility to manage our capital base
through the new regime, we very much want to be much more efficient with the usage of the balance
sheet.

Now we didn't try to marry that with how much of the balance sheet comes down, how much of that is
going to pour -- is going to come into fee waivers. And remember, if we are growing the money market
funds, we are waiving a pile of the fees as well. So fee waivers go up a little bit even though there is some
net benefit to us from that. We didn't try to solve that in the guidance that we gave you. We just made it
simple, but it's not going to be material in -- a material number.

Operator

Our next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.

Robert Henry Wildhack
Autonomous Research LLP

Just wanted to follow up on a couple of the business lines you called out. Particularly noticed that Issuer
Services and Treasury Services performed well. You mentioned some of the drivers, particularly the new
product in Treasury Services. But wondering how sustainable you think the growth rates seen in this
quarter are going forward.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 15, 2021

Yes. I think we continue to see -- as we continue to invest in our payments platform and volumes are
moving nicely and we're capturing a little bit of market share, as we look out, we think it's sustainable that
we can see some decent growth. And we're introducing some new products that are getting some take-up.
So our -- the real-time payments for collections is going to be a very interesting product, and we've got a
pretty robust pipeline for that. And we look forward to announcing something in the not-too-distant future
around opportunities there.

And so I think the team has done a good job of capturing that high-margin business. I think the sales
effort globally has been strong, and I think we're well positioned to be a provider of services around the
globe. We've got great relationships, and I think we're benefiting from that. So I think there's a little bit of
room for continued growth there.

When you look at issuer -- when we look at Issuer Services, that includes Corporate Trust as well as the
DR business. Corporate Trust, we've made good inroads in the CLO business. Frankly, a few years ago,
we lost a little market share. We're capturing that. We've rebuilt our platform there. And then very good
growth in kind of the conventional debt servicing. And DRs, they were very much impacted by COVID. And
so now that we're seeing some of these global companies paying dividends, again, we're seeing a little
more activity there. And so I think there's room to sustain where we are and grow a bit off of it.

Emily Hope Portney
Chief Financial Officer

Just 2 quick things I'd add. On the Treasury Services space, it's a very fragmented market. So it's
ultimately -- even a little bit of share gain actually moves the needle considerably. And in DR, as Todd
alluded to, just the third quarter tends to be seasonally our best quarter. We had a very strong second
quarter, again, as Todd alluded to, with the resumption of dividends and certainly issuance activity. So the
step up will probably be a little bit less in the third quarter.

Operator

And our final question comes from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar.

Rajiv K. Bhatia
Morningstar Inc., Research Division

Just a quick question on your margins. So your investment servicing margin was 34%. Curious if you can
provide any color on the pretax margins of your -- of the various LOBs within there. So for example, I
think several years ago, you spoke about Issuer Services and Treasury Services being higher margin.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Okay. Rajiv, we don't disclose the operating margins across the various businesses. And we did benefit in
that margin, obviously, from the reserve release because a lot of that is related to it, but we did see a little
bit of underlying margin improvement. But the operating margins of the various businesses, most of them
are similar to what we see across the total, but for example, clearance and collateral is a bit higher.

Operator

And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the
call back over to Todd with any additional or closing remarks.

Thomas P. Gibbons
CEO & Director

Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I know it's a very busy day so we
appreciate the engagement, and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you very much.
