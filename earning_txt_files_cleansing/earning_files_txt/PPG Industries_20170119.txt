Thank you, Vince
And before we start with my prepared remarks, I would like to take a minute to recognize the announcement today that we made that Frank Sklarsky will be retiring on March 1. Frank joined us 4 years ago and came to us with a very diverse background, serving as CFO for several companies in different industries
Frank has applied that past experience since he has arrived and has been truly a great thought leader, change agent and steady hand that has guided us through financially very strategic actions
Both internally and externally, including with our shareholders, Frank has brought a tremendous amount of skill and energy to the job
Frank, thank you for your many contributions to PPG and congratulations on your well-deserved retirement
I also want to congratulate Vince on his announcement appointing him as CFO, March 1. Vince has been an integral part of the PPG family for more than 30 years, served in a variety of internal and external facing financial roles
Over that time, he has proven to be a broad thinker, leader and valuable contributor to the executive team as we transform the company
His deep knowledge of PPG and our businesses, the coatings and chemical industries and the capital markets will serve him well in the new role
So once again, congratulations to both of you
And so now I want to talk a little bit about our fourth quarter performance
Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2016 results
For the fourth quarter, our net sales were $3.5 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.19. This represents an EPS growth rate of 3% for the quarter and we achieved an EPS growth rate of 7% for the year
While these figures fall short of our EPS growth goals, both numbers were noticeably impacted by persistent unfavorable currency translation
For the fourth quarter, our reported net sales were down 1.5% while our sales in local currencies increased by more than 1%
Supporting the higher local currency sales were increased volumes approaching 2% in our coatings segment
This figure matched our highest quarterly growth rate in 2016. Also minimally impacting our net sales in the quarter were our portfolio optimization actions as acquisition-related sales modestly exceeded the absence of sales from the divested businesses, we are still including in our continuing operations
As I mentioned, foreign currency translation remained a significant factor affecting our financial results with fourth quarter net sales unfavorably impacted by approximately $100 million and pre-tax income impacted by about $25 million
For the full year, this impact was about $400 million on sales and about $70 million on pre-tax earnings
Looking at some business trends in the fourth quarter and from an end market perspective, our highest volume growth rates was achieved in our industrial coatings segment with each business unit matching or exceeding industry growth rates by delivering at least a mid-single-digit percentage volume growth
Sales volumes continue to expand in automotive OEM coatings and were consistent with overall mid single-digit percentage global industry build growth
Our above-market performance in the faster growing regions of Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America was in contrast to the lower industry and PPG volumes in the U.S
and Canada
We also continue to grow sales, volumes in general industrial coatings, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of above market growth rates, with positive year-over-year contributions from each region
In addition, packaging coatings growth volume remains strong as customers continue to adopt our Innovel interior can coatings products around the globe
In performance coatings, automotive refinish volumes grew a low single-digit percentage as the growth returned to Europe following lower year-over-year demand in the third quarter and volumes continued to expand in Asia
Aerospace and architectural coatings EMEA sales volumes were in line with prior year as industry growth remained tepid for both businesses
Specifically in architectural coatings, sales volumes grew in Europe, with the strength in the UK, Ireland and Benelux countries, but was offset by declines in Africa where many economies are closely linked to the depressed commodity prices
Sales volumes improved in architectural coatings Americas and Asia-Pacific as gains in the U.S
and Canada company-owned stores was partially offset by lower demand in the independent dealer network and uncertain national retail accounts
Sales growth in Mexico continued despite comparison to strong prior year growth
Sales volume growth was also positive year-over-year in the smaller markets, Central America, Australia, China and Brazil
In contrast, significant low double-digit sales volume declines occurred in protective and marine coatings as further weakness in marine shipbuilding activity more than offset PPGâ€™s specific growth in protective coatings
We are continued to aggressively manage our costs in this business to neutralize the earnings impact of these expected market-based activity level declines
Glass segment volumes declined 3% in North American fiberglass business, principally due to lower wind energy product demand
From a regional perspective, sales volume growth was led by emerging regions
Asian demand growth was broad-based across many of our businesses, but was partly offset by significant declines in regional shipbuilding as previously mentioned
Volumes in Latin America were also positive despite comparison to strong prior year growth in several businesses, including PPG Comex
Volume growth also improved in Europe after a relatively flat comparison to prior year in the third quarter 2016. Growth in this region was also broad-based, which was more comparable to the growth patterns we experienced for most of 2015 and the first half of 2016 when our volumes expanded for six consecutive quarters
From an earnings perspective, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.19 improved by 3% versus the prior year quarter
Aiding our earnings growth were higher sales volumes and lower overall costs, which included a positive impact from our prior year restructuring program
In addition, earnings per share benefited from our ongoing cash deployment actions
This included the impact of our repurchase of $650 million of PPG stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year 2016 share repurchase to $1.050 billion or nearly 11 million shares
In the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 2.8% lower versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Now, I would like to comment quickly on our full year results from continuing operations
These results do not include the divested flat glass business financial results, which have been classified as discontinued operations
On a full year basis, our sales from continuing operations were $14.8 billion, consistent with the prior year despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of approximately $400 million or about 3%
Our full year sales volumes grew about 1%
Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $5.82, up 7% versus the prior year
We were able to grow our full year earnings despite modest and uneven global economic growth for the second consecutive year
We accomplished this by another strong year of operational excellence
Our more significant actions included commercialization of new products and technologies allowing us to deliver above market growth in several of our businesses, continued successful integration and earnings accretion from prior and current year acquisitions, completion of our previously announced restructuring program including achievement of savings commitments and lastly, a hallmark of improved productivity and aggressive cost management and our manufacturing operations and within our overall administrative and business support cost structure
In addition to these operational items, we allocated more resources and investments to our growth related opportunities and expect that this will continue to yield dividends in our organic growth rate going forward
Over the course of the year, we continue to execute on our strategic objectives to strengthen the company
We further optimized our business portfolio with the acquisition of MetoKote, a global leader in coatings applications and Univer, an Italian architectural coatings company
In addition, we closed on the acquisition of Deutek, a Romanian architectural coatings leader in early January 2017. We were equally active in addressing the non-core part of our portfolio as we completed the divestitures of our flat glass business, our European fiber glass business, our ownership interest in two Asian fiber glass joint ventures as well as our minority interest in Pittsburgh Glass Works
These divestitures, which most occurred later in the year, provided us with almost $1 billion of gross proceeds
We fully intend to deploy these proceeds in an accretive manner that will create value for our shareholders
As a result of these portfolio actions, 97% of our 2016 net sales was composed from revenue from our core coatings, coating services and specialty material businesses
Our revised business portfolio has a broader geographic reach, more opportunities for enhanced customer intimacy and technology dependency
It also delivers strong and consistent operating cash flow, requires less capital intensity and we expect it to be more resilient to overall shifts in the economic activity
In addition to the portfolio moves, we continue to reduce legacy related risk by fully funding our portion of Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust and by annuitizing a significant portion of our U.S
and Canadian pension obligations
We are pleased to have put some of these significant non-core obligations behind us, thus reducing volatility in future earnings and cash flow
We also continue our strong cash generation with about $1.2 billion generated from continuing operations for the year
This included a reduction associated with a net after-tax cash flow related to the full funding of Pittsburgh Corning Asbestos Trust
Excluding this impact, cash flow from operations was almost $1.9 billion for the year
One of the key enablers of this cash performance was our continuing effort to be more efficient with working capital
This year, we reduced our working capital by another 120 basis points as a percentage of revenue, including noteworthy improvements in inventory efficiency
The company has averaged more than 100 basis point annual improvement in this metric for the past 4 years
In addition, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we continued our legacy returning cash to shareholders with nearly $1.5 billion in share repurchases and dividends
Regarding dividends, 2016 marked the 117th consecutive year of dividend payouts and the 45th consecutive year of annual payout increases after an 11% per share increase in April 2016. As we look ahead to 2017, we are operating in an evolving macroeconomic and regulatory environment
Our expectations are for improved momentum in the overall global economic growth with â€“ including gradually higher growth rates in developed regions and continuing but uneven growth in emerging regions
We anticipate economic growth rates to improve in the U.S
and Canada, including a modest acceleration in industrial production and GDP rates versus 2016. We expect construction markets to expand at a continued measured rate
Lastly, we believe that regional automotive industry builds will be flat or decline modestly year-over-year after several years of post-recession expansion
In Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion in Mexico
And in South America, we expect to return to flat or slightly positive year-over-year economic growth following a multi-year contraction in economic output
Growth rates in Asia are expected to remain generally consistent with 2016, with continued industrial production growth in China as well as gains in Southeast Asia and India
Automotive build growth is expected to remain positive in the region, but at a more modest growth rates in comparison to 2016. Economic growth in Europe is expected to continue but remain varied by sub-region and country
Favorable end use market trends are expected to continue, particularly in automotive OEM coatings as industry build growth rates are expected to remain positive
Despite our cautious optimism for 2017 economic growth, the timeline for this growth remains uncertain
As such, we will aggressively manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions
We recently initiated an almost $200 million business restructuring program focused on reducing our costs where business conditions remain the most uncertain and we will continue to support the momentum in our recent growth related initiatives
Additionally, we have initiated targeted selling price increases to combat recent inflationary cost pressures in several markets and regions
We will continue to closely monitor our input costs and we will work with customers in a collaborative and equitable manner
Finally, we remain in a position of strength as we ended the year with nearly $1.9 billion of cash and short-term investments and this provides us with significant financial flexibility going forward
Supported by our strong cash generation, we reached the top end of our cash deployment range for 2015 and 2016 combined by deploying over $2.5 billion on share repurchases and acquisitions
Today, we announced a new 2-year cash deployment range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases for the years 2017 and 2018 combined, reflecting our continuing focus on shareholder value creation
We continue to believe that the coatings space remains a consolidating industry and acquisition pipeline remains active across geographies and end use markets
And of course, share repurchases will also remain an important element of our capital allocation strategy
I will conclude by saying that 2016 was a good year for PPG and we delivered record adjusted EPS despite uneven economic conditions and against a volatile currency backdrop
We have completed many strategic actions to make the company stronger and more resilient in the future
We look forward to another successful year, 2017. Now, I will turn it over to Frank, who will cover some 2017 financial assumptions
So David, we have announced price increases in a number of regions
So, just Canada, U.S
, Mexico, Brazil, Central America, UK, Ireland, the Benelux as well as select countries in Central America or Central Europe, excuse me
So we have been aggressive in doing that
As you know, historically, we have always told people that we work with our customers on a proactive basis
We expect that as they start to see the price increases coming through, they can expect us to come and talk to them
I think they can see it coming now and so we are in discussions with a number of our customers
Well, I think gross margins are â€“ you could see that we went down a little bit in industrial
Iâ€™m sure somebody will ask a question about that
And then raw materials will have some pressure
If you think about where we were in the first quarter last year with oil at $35, now we are at all oil at, letâ€™s call it, $55 to round it up
So, you can expect that even though sequentially, raw materials are going to be rather flattish from fourth quarter to first quarter on a year-over-year basis, raw materials are up
So, I would say margins are going to be challenged in the beginning, but we have our restructuring program we announced and that will certainly provide us some benefit in the second half of the year
Yes, Frank, clearly, we are still not happy with â€“ it maybe our best quarter yet call it slightly under 2% for our coatings portfolio
So we have told people that we expect to be GDP and when we are performing at a high performance, we would be GDP plus
So you probably saw in the corporate line that corporate costs were down
That was partly driven by us not hitting our volume goals
So, you could expect to see us continue to push organic growth as a key lever for us in 2017 and I think we will continue to get better as the year goes by
So Kevin, I will take the second half of the question, which is how do we think that will â€“ mix will be
Right now, I would describe our acquisition pipeline as similar to what we have seen in the past
So we did slightly under $400 million the last couple of years in acquisitions
Obviously, the prices of acquisitions have gone up
We have adjusted our thinking on our own whack and those returns
At the end of the day though, we do see a lot of people think we see them paying exceptionally high prices for acquisitions
So we are going to continue to be disciplined and I would expect to see a similar type relationship between acquisitions and buying back shares
Well, I think the way I would describe that Ghansham is that we have always said our large, global, sophisticated customers typically kind of ply more price pressure than our businesses that go through distribution
And you saw some price degradation across the company
So you could probably make a pretty good guess of where that would be
What I would tell you though, is we have already started talking to all our customers about raw materials
So this is the early innings of that
I would tell you that overall though, they are paying for technology
So when you think about the industry, we have been growing at a faster rate than the industry in three of the four regions
And most of that has to do with technology, where we have captured additional share due to our Compact Process as well as bringing better productivity in their own OEM shops
So I think overall, our growth has been pretty much driven by meeting or exceeding our customer requirements
Well, itâ€™s such a choppy environment over there in Europe
We have a number of countries, I mean you take UK, Ireland, I mean they have just consistently performed at a very high level
Germany doing pretty well
The laggards â€“ I would say Southern Europe is also improving
So five quarters out of the last six quarters, we have had positive growth in Europe
And I would anticipate that we would have positive growth, but uneven in 2017. What also is in that number that has held it back, of course has been Middle East
Middle East is an important market for us and that market has certainly been under a lot of pressure as well as Africa
So Continental Europe, I am constructive on it
I think it is improving
And of course, from the automotive builds, I would say that we are probably in the sixth or seventh inning
We have a long way to go
They only made 13 million cars in Western Europe and we can see 16 million or 17 million cars easily, so more growth there to come
By the way, I misspoke as 14 million in Europe, builds
Okay
So letâ€™s think about it this way, Dmitry
We typically paint a ship 9 months to 15 months after the order is taken
This year, orders in Korea are down 85% from the peak, and across Asia they are down 60% from the peak
So there is still more downward pressure in that market, but I donâ€™t think orders are going to get worse
So I think from an order standpoint, itâ€™s probably nearing the bottom
Now, the good news is we are aggressively managing our costs
So we can see as the order book thins, that we are taking aggressive action in that area and thatâ€™s part of the reason why you saw the fourth quarter announcement about restructuring
That was one of the businesses that was significantly impacted by that
Youâ€™re welcome
And Jeff, let me just add
We are â€“ I want to disabuse you of the thought that earnings would be flat
Thatâ€™s not our base case at all, not only are we going to have volume growth thatâ€™s going to be a positive
We are going to have earnings accretive cash deployment, that will be a positive and we have the self-help from our restructuring program
So, thatâ€™s also a help
So, we will see positive EPS growth year-over-year
Thanks, Jeff
So PJ, itâ€™s always hard to draw inferences from the fourth quarter
Obviously, we have line reviews going on
One of the major differences â€˜15 versus â€˜16 if you remember â€˜15 we had a very warm October, early November
We had very good stain sales in that regard
It did not repeat in 2016. We had positive POS
So, the sell-out is better than the sell-in
That gives us some good feelings going forward
Like I said, fourth quarter and first quarter are always difficult to think about it from the standpoint that the home centers can make adjustments in their inventories
But when we look at the POS data, weâ€™re â€“ I would say we are still optimistic
Well, I donâ€™t think I want to tell you my comfort zone, because people might know where we want to bid
But obviously, when you look at the Dunn-Edwards number, I would tell you that Nippon was aggressive, overly aggressive in our opinion
Clearly, they were wanting to get a toehold in the U.S
market
They viewed this as an opportunistic way to get in and they took advantage of that
So, I would tell you that the multiples are clearly higher, but we are just going to have to adapt to the changing environment
So, let me address a couple of those questions, Dan
The first one is we have taken the Comex model into Central America
We gave guidance that it would be $60 million to $70 million in new sales
We are tracking above that growth rate
We said that would be over a 3 to 5-year period
Central America for us grew a very small business obviously, but it grew nearly 40% year-over-year
So, it was an outstanding performer from that regard
The Comex team, we have said it would grow more than 2x GDP, has exceeded that significantly, so another good year by the PPG-Comex team
The current unrest because of the raise in gasoline prices, we have lost about 300 store days, which through the first, whatever, 20, 19 days, itâ€™s really insignificant
Itâ€™s less than 1% of our total store days being opened
I looked at the sales through the first 19 days
The sales are ahead of last yearâ€™s pace
So we are tracking pretty well in that regard
So obviously, we are not happy with the unrest
But overall, it has not impacted our business
I am more concerned about the consumer sentiment
Right now, consumer sentiment in Mexico remains solid
And so we anticipate another good year
Last year, we opened 212 stores, which is more than one store every other day
We are up to 4,213 stores
We have a plan to open almost another 200 stores this year
So overall, we expect to have another very good year in Mexico
I would say right now, it does
Itâ€™s certainly below the company average
But like many acquisitions, we do marine was cobbled together through various acquisitions
It appreciates over time
This business was pretty much at the company average prior to the downturn in the shipbuilding business and we fully expect it to be back at or above the industry or the company average, but certainly not until the industry recovers
Thanks
John, I donâ€™t sit in either Atlanta or Charlotte or D
from a regulatory standpoint
So I really would be total speculation
I think I should stay away from speculating
But I think they are all looking at it and they will all make their best judgments depending upon how it all works out
Well, glass will continue to be a reported segment while we have in our portfolio the North American fiber glass business will continue to be in continuing operations
We stated before that the glass businesses are not necessarily part of the core business, but the businesses did well in 2016. Itâ€™s expected to continue to improve in 2017 based on the actions that the business has taken
They have done a good job
And it will continue to be reportable segment and continuing operations until otherwise
So the first question deals with the acquisition
So we owned 50% of Univer
So there is zero integration except that we have lower costs now with the former ownership and some additional layers that we are able to take out post the prior owners leaving
So zero, totally integrated, already performing at a higher level than previously
Deutek in Romania, this is a standard PPG deal, where we go in and raw materials get brought in day 1. So January 4, raw material prices went down there
And then we are going to bring in our additional products
They can sell in Romania
So that will be a positive
And then we will roll the back office into our various back office centers in Europe
So that integration we expect to go very smoothly, and there are more opportunities in Europe to acquire
This is still a very regional business
We are constantly talking to families that own coatings companies in Europe
They are always part of our pipeline
And we just canâ€™t predict when one generation will decide to sell
In regards to a pan-European brand, we have looked at that
We have also been asked by several of our larger DIY customers in Europe about that
We are expecting that they will roll out something similar but not quite pan-European in the early 2017 with one of our products
So we will wait to see how that launches
But by and large, it is still a very regional business
Well, I would tell you that historically, we have been fairly accurate on the paint projections
We said last year in 2016, it would be 2% to 3%
I think that was borne out
I think people still underestimate the size of the maintenance business
I mean itâ€™s letâ€™s call it 70% to 80% of all paint is applied in a maintenance mode and so despite how strong housing looks in the house formation as well as new home sales, that doesnâ€™t move the needle as much as the maintenance side of the business
So I would tell you that we expect to see 2% to 3% growth again in 2017. And I might add one other item to your prior question and that is we donâ€™t participate in a number of countries in Europe, so there are still more growth opportunities in those countries that we donâ€™t participate in
So when I think about Europe there is obviously elections in France, election later in the year in Germany
I donâ€™t know when the elections in Italy will come because itâ€™s a very complicated country for that
But consumer sentiment still is what I would call modest and most of our customers are kind of put that other back of their mind
They say, hey, we are going to continue to perform
We are going to continue to push our own customers to grow
And so thatâ€™s why we are thinking that Europe is going to grow 2 plus kind of percent next year for us
So I think thatâ€™s our sentiment there
For Mexico, from the supply chain standpoint, we paint cars in Mexico and we paint cars in the U.S
So whatever consternation may or may not be out there, we will paint cars wherever they are built
So for us, that is a bigger question for our customers than it is for us because they know we will be there whenever and wherever they need us
We donâ€™t really see a significant share shift from DIY to pro
I mean, obviously, the bigger issue is pros are full up
There is not a lot of new painters coming in the market
So, I would say there is probably a little bit of a drag if anything from the professional side, because I donâ€™t see a lot of young painters out there
Thatâ€™s correct, Tom [ph]
So this is a little history lesson
We saw a little modest second quarter and third quarter increases in 2016. In the fourth quarter, no increases except a little bit in China
So we still believe this is a supply-demand driven business
Supply is slightly up
Demand is slightly up
So they are pretty much in balance from that standpoint
The only thing we can see is that we see some of our smaller companies that we have been looking at buy-in, some of them do price buy-in
Obviously, thatâ€™s an artificial demand
Itâ€™s not a good business practice, but they feel like they need to protect themselves because they are not like some of the larger coatings companies that can negotiate hard in this regard
So we donâ€™t anticipate significant upward pressure
But again, itâ€™s a supply-demand driven business and we will react accordingly
I think the way I would describe that is we are in the third inning of a nine-inning ballgame
We have a number of trials still going on
We have a number of conversions that we have to get accomplished in 2017. And of course and then there is still more work to be done
They canâ€™t take on all that work overnight and there are still a number of countries around the world that they havenâ€™t converted
So like I said, we are in the third inning
And we have been winning more than our fair share
The brand owners really love PPG
They love the technology that we are bringing and thatâ€™s been a real positive for us
James, we had covered this in previous calls
We had to make a choice on where to take business going into 2016 and we preferentially picked up business in Asia and Europe, where we saw the growth rates at a higher level
And so we have grown so much faster than the market
Our large customers wanted to make sure that we didnâ€™t get too large in that space
So thatâ€™s what happened
We would â€“ you should expect another one to two more quarters of negative comps versus the industry
And then we will anniversary it
Actually what I anticipate going forward is that they have not moved the Compact Process yet in the U.S
And when they decide to do some Brownfields in the U.S
, we will then start to win at a very good rate
So I am optimistic going forward starting in 2000 probably â€“ Brownfields will probably be a 2018, 2019 kind of initiative
Well, I would tell you that thatâ€™s highly speculative
It takes a while for policy changes to work its way through the executive and legislative branches
Infrastructure is good, so if it happens, we will be all over it
It does take a while to gear up to do some of these things
So we have not put that in our forward-looking plan for 2017.
