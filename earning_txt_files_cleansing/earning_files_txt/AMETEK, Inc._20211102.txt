Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AMETEK Third Quarter 2021
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin
Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Kevin C. Coleman
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Angie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to change
based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from
expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is
contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements.

Any references made on this call to 2020 or 2021 results will be on an adjusted basis after-tax,
acquisition-related intangible amortization and also excluding the gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in
the first quarter of 2020 and the realignment charges taken in the first quarter of 2020. Reconciliations
between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of
our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for
questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another outstanding quarter with better-
than-expected sales growth, strong operating performance and earnings above our expectations. We
established records before sales, EBITDA, operating income and earnings per share in the quarter.
Demand remains strong across our diverse set of end markets, leading to robust order growth and a
record backlog. While the global supply chain and logistics networks remain challenging, our businesses
are doing a tremendous job navigating these issues and delivering results, which exceeded our
expectations.

Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our sales
and earnings guidance for the full year. This strong overall performance reflects the exceptional work of all
AMETEK colleagues as well as the strength, flexibility and sustainability of the AMETEK growth model.

AMETEK's proven business model was central to our focus on creating a sustainable future for all
stakeholders. We are very proud of the important steps we are taking to further sustainability across
AMETEK. And last week, we published our latest corporate sustainability report to highlight our efforts in
this area. This report provides information on our sustainability initiatives, the strong progress we have
made and the commitments we are making to create a better future. I welcome you all to read our latest
corporate sustainability report, which is located on our website.

Now let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.44 billion, up 28%
over the same period in 2020 and above our expectations. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions
added 11 points and foreign currency was a modest benefit in the quarter. Overall, orders in the third
quarter were $1.55 billion, an increase of 37% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up an
impressive 31% in the quarter.

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.62 billion, which is up over $800 million from the start
of the year. Third quarter operating income was a record $338 million, a 25% increase over the third
quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 23.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core
operating margins were 24.7%, up 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA in the third
quarter was a record $415 million, up 25% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 28.8%. This
outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.26 per diluted share, up 25% over the third quarter
of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.16 to $1.18. We continue to generate strong levels of cash
flow with third quarter operating cash flow of $307 million and free cash flow conversion of 109% of net
income. Overall, tremendous results in a challenging operating environment.

Next, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments
Group. Sales for EIG were a record $982 million, up 31% over last year's third quarter. Organic sales were
up 15%, acquisitions added 16% and foreign currency was a modest headwind. While growth remains
broad-based, growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies and our Power &
Industrial businesses. EIG's third quarter operating income was a record $245 million, up 20% versus the
same quarter last year and operating margins were 25%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were
excellent at 27.2%, in line with prior year margins.

The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating
performance. Third quarter sales increased 21% versus the prior year to $459 million. Organic sales
were up 20% and currency added 1 point to growth. Growth remains strong across all of EMG with our
automation businesses again delivering notably strong growth in the quarter. EMG's operating income
in the quarter was a record $115 million, up a robust 36% compared to the prior year period. EMG's
operating margins expanded an exceptional 270 basis points to a record 25%.

Now switching to our acquisition strategy. AMETEK has had an excellent year with a record level of
capital deployment, leading to the acquisition of 5 highly strategic businesses. AMETEK has deployed
approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far this year, reflecting the strength of AMETEK's
acquisition strategy and our ability to identify and acquire highly strategic companies.

Our proven operating capabilities allow us to drive meaningful improvements across our acquired
companies, resulting in outstanding returns on capital. Generating strong returns on capital deployed is
critical to long-term sustainable growth, an important element of AMETEK's strategy. AMETEK's strong
cash flow generation continues to support our capital deployment strategy.

Our acquisition pipeline remains very active. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, identifying
attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain busy over the coming quarters. We also
remain focused on investing back into our businesses to support the organic growth initiatives, including
in support of their new product development efforts. In the third quarter, we invested over $75 million in
RD&E, and for all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $300 million or approximately 5.5% of
sales.

Through these investments, our businesses developed unique and highly differentiated solutions to
help solve their customers' most complex challenges. One such example is a new product introduction
from AMETEK Gatan. Gatan is a leading provider of direct detection technology for electron microscopy,
supporting high-end research and materials and life sciences applications. Gatan recently introduced
the Stela Hybrid-Pixel Camera, the only fully integrated hybrid-pixel electron detector with the Gatan
microscopy suite.

This new product reinforces Gatan's leadership position providing the highest quality TEM defraction
camera, allowing the user to perform 4D STEM analysis with rapid speed and high dynamic range. Gatan's
new camera builds on a long history of disruptive and award-winning technology. In August, the Stela
Camera was awarded the 2021 Microscopy Today Innovation Award and called one of the 10 game-
changing products and methods. I would like to congratulate the team at Gatan for the recent launch of
the Stela camera and for the support of important research applications.

Now let me touch on the supply chain issues. The global supply chain remains challenging. We see
extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components with logistics issues and labor

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

availability adding to the complexity. While these difficulties exist, we exceeded our sales estimates for
the quarter and are navigating the challenging environment well, given our agile operating approach.
These supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, given our differentiation, we were able
to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing leading to a strong price inflation spread. While we
expect these challenges will continue into 2022, we remain well-positioned to navigate the issues given
the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model.

Moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the third
quarter and the continued strong orders momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021
sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up in the low 20%
range versus our previous guide of up approximately 20%. Organic sales are now expected to be up low
double digits on a percentage basis over 2020 as compared to our previous count of approximately 10%.
Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.76 to $4.78, an increase of
approximately 21% over 2020's comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.62 to $4.68 per diluted
share. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the low 20% range versus last
year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $1.28 to
$1.30, up 19% to 20% over last year's fourth quarter.

In summary, AMETEK's third quarter results were excellent. Our teams continued to execute and our
businesses are performing well. Our performance through a challenging environment shows the resilience
and strength of the AMETEK growth model. The asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions
in attractive niche markets and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable
success. The proven nature of the AMETEK growth model continue to drive long-term success for all of
AMETEK take orders. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the
quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?

William Joseph Burke
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter with
continued strong sales growth and orders growth and outstanding operating performance. Let me provide
some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses
were $22.1 million, up $4.8 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense.
As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the prior year. For 2021,
general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately $18 million, driven by higher
compensation costs or approximately 1.5% of sales, also unchanged from the prior year.

Third quarter other income and expense was better by approximately $4 million versus last year's third
quarter, driven by a $6 million or approximately $0.02 per share gain on the sale of a small product line
in the quarter. This gain on the sale was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate in the quarter of
19.5%, up from 17.5% in the same quarter last year. For 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be
between 19.5% and 20%. Actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively,
from this full year estimated rate.

Working capital in the quarter was 14.9% of sales, down 210 basis points from the 17% reported in the
third quarter of 2020, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in managing working capital. Capital
expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be
approximately $120 million for the full year. Depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter
was $75 million. For all of 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $295
million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $138 million or
$0.60 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business
model and working capital management efforts. In the third quarter, operating cash flow was $307 million
and free cash flow was $281 million, with free cash flow conversion 109% of net income.

Total debt at quarter end was $2.65 billion up less than $250 million from the end of 2020, despite having
deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far in 2021. Offsetting this debt was cash and
cash equivalents of $359 million. And at quarter end, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x and our

net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with
approximately $2.25 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.

To summarize, our businesses drove outstanding results in the third quarter and throughout the first 9
months of 2021. Our balance sheet and tremendous cash flow generation have positioned the company for
significant growth in the coming quarters and years. Kevin?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

A couple of questions. First, Dave, can you talk about where you were with realized pricing in the third
quarter on a year-over-year basis? What the spread looked like? You mentioned it seems pretty favorable,
and then what your thoughts are in terms of how much price you might need to take in '22.

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Sure, Matt. In the third quarter, our pricing continued to more than offset inflation. As I said in the
prepared remarks, pricing was about 3.5% of sales and inflation was about 2.5% of sales. So we've got a
spread of about 100 basis points. And we expect in Q4 that will be similar to Q3 with slightly higher pricing
and inflation, and the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK's product portfolio and
our leadership position in niche markets around the world. In terms of next year, we haven't done the
detailed planning, but a key for me is that we're going to stay up ahead of inflation, and I expect that to
be true next year. So we'll stay ahead of inflation with price. Does that answer your question, Matt?

Matt J. Summerville
D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division

Yes. And then just as a follow-up, if I just look over the last 2 years, EMG margins have really migrated
into a completely different ZIP code versus where they were at. I know divesting with Reading is a
component to that. You did some structural cost-outs during the COVID outbreak. Is there still leverage
to drive margins higher in that business? How do we think about how we should think about that going
forward?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. EMG has done a fantastic job in margin development, and you mentioned some of the key drivers.
We divested Reading. But more fundamentally, I mean, we have an automation business that's firing
on all cylinders, that's very profitable. We have a thermal management system as part of our defense
industry, defense businesses. It's doing well and it's high margin. And then we have some part of our
EMEA business that's accelerating. So it isn't a new ZIP code, but I expect it to stay there and there's still
room for margin expansion.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Unknown Analyst

This is actually Gustavo on for Josh. So looking at backlog, where it stands today, how much of that would
you call, call it, excess backlog kind of based on supply chain issues? And how much should we expect that
contribute to 2022 growth here?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. We have a record backlog of $2.62 billion and I wouldn't categorize as excess. I mean I mentioned
in our earlier call that customer behavior is to give you more visibility into future months and quarters
because there's so many issues in the supply chain. So you have more visibility, but I would not consider it

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

as excess. And I would not view us as not keeping up with demand. So really, you have a situation where
there's strong underlying demand. It's resulting in a higher backlog. It's giving us further insight into
2022, and we feel real good about it.

Unknown Analyst

Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. So what are kind of the biggest inflation and supply chain issues
that we should kind of watch for AMETEK as conditions potentially do start to improve? Is it on the
material side, freight or labor? Just kind of what should we keep our eyes on?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes, that's a good question. And during the quarter, we continued to experience challenges with our
supply chain, logistics, inflation, labor availability and it was one of the more dynamic environments
I can recall. And these conditions were a bit worse in Q3 than Q2, and we expect those conditions to
persist in the fourth quarter. And I would characterize our overall effort in response to these challenges as
outstanding. We're clearly showing the agility necessary to navigate these supply chain disruptions. A key,
from my view, is the distributed nature of our business model, where we have committed P&L managers
running their businesses with their own supply chain teams, which allow them to react quickly to changing
conditions. And at the same time, these dedicated business unit teams are working seamlessly with
our overall corporate supply chain team that acts with a combined leverage in the authority of all of the
AMETEK.

And this overall approach has been effective for us. I mean you asked where we had some -- the biggest
issues we had, as I mentioned last quarter, it's in semiconductor, chip available. It's an area that's
particularly challenging because we use a lot of electronics in our businesses, obviously. And we're using
our purchasing leverage, the relationships that we built up over decades, our engineering capability in
terms of qualifying second sources, in terms of changing designs to solve problems. And we don't expect
to anticipate improvements in the availability of semiconductors until sometime in late 2022. So it's a
tough environment and -- but we're reacting well to it, and I was very pleased with our teams. And I point
to one thing, it's a distributed business model, where we have very experienced P&L leaders, making sure
that they're going to satisfy their customers and not letting the supply chain get in the way.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.

Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

I just want to keep in line with this -- because, obviously, you guys are a bit unique in that you've
certainly been managing this quite well. Is there a sense -- I mean, organic growth is very strong in our
organic quarters are very strong. Is there any tempering of maybe what growth could have been because
of some of these supply chain issues or really not impactful to you guys in terms of what that expected
growth could be or the volume that you were anticipating this quarter?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. That's a good question, Allison, because what we do is we set our plan based on material availability,
and we executed that plan extremely well. In fact, we beat our expectations. But we did at the end of
the quarter. I look at it as, if the stars aligned, what could we have shipped without some of the material
availability issues. And it was about an additional $50 million that shifted out of Q3 to Q4. And I feel
like we're going to have the same kind of shift of Q4 into Q1 so we're able to meet demand. We're able
to juggle the schedule. Once we lock into the schedule, we're very good at executing it but there was
about $50 million that slipped out. Now we're not a big labor business. We have -- labor is not a big cost
driver for us. So labor availability is tough, but we're able to get the products manufactured with the labor
available. So your answer is $50 million in an ideal world.

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the acquisition environment, you obviously deployed a significant
amount at the beginning of the year. And it sounds like the pipeline, as always, is pretty active. Any color
on kind of what you're a little bit more focused on or what we could see maybe near term over the next
few months if the stars align there?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. We are very focused on some deals right now. And I don't know if they're going to happen next
month or 3 months from now, but we're very active over the next few months. I mean the thing you have
to be careful of right now is there's a lot of businesses that are out there, and you have to sort through
them and find the quality -- find a gems within those pipelines, and we're good at that. And I just feel
the pipeline remains strong. We're very active on exploring opportunities. As Bill mentioned, we have a
meaningful level of financing capacity and strong cash flows. And we also have -- so I think 2022 is going
to be a good year for us. And we're going to have a tailwind from some of the deals we got done this year.
So we're feeling pretty optimistic about what we've got done this year, the quality of businesses that we've
acquired, and we're feeling good about our pipeline for 2022.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Really solid execution this quarter when many of your peers have struggled. I think it was interesting on
Allison's question there, we actually had to drag it out of you, that there was a $50 million pushout on
revenues. We've seen that and also have seen where that is like a rolling pushout in from 4Q into the first
quarter. But I like how the fact that wasn't an excuse. You still put up strong numbers, so congrats there.

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Thank you.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

A couple of questions. There's this thought here on the supply chain issues for companies like AMETEK
that are higher up the value chain. You're not doing raw material conversions. You're more final test and
assembly. So it's the component supply might be -- the impact might be felt later. So that -- this might
become more of an issue for component supply in the coming quarters. We know it's chip-related already,
but is there any sense we think it gets worse from here, again, where you are on the value chain?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. I don't see it getting worse. As I mentioned, it was worse in Q3 than Q2, but things seem to have
stabilized. The comment that I'd make is it's a good one, of your question. And inflation is a concern
related to our backlog, but we think it's manageable even with the high-level components. And the first
key for me is that you have firm supplier pricing for items in the backlog as much as possible. So you
know what your costs are going to be.

And then we do have some commodities that we use in various areas, and when possible, when we have
firm orders, we'll buy forward certain key commodities to lock in costs where appropriate. We're using
surcharges to handle increases in shipping costs, increases in transportation costs, higher energy costs,
et cetera. We shortened the length of our quotation validity, the valid time our quotations are out there.

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

So items can be repriced, if necessary. And then you take into account the higher cost. And when you can,
and it's necessary, you're -- our customers have been fairly receptive to get to -- to get a price increase
due to what's happening right now.

So I put that whole package together. And if we're a bit later than some of the component businesses that
may be true. But at the same time, we're willing -- running well ahead of inflation with our pricing and we
plan to stay there. And that's going to be a big part of our budgeting process that we're going through and
to understand what's happening in the market, to understand inflations. And with 3.5% of price and 2.5%
inflation across our entire businesses, I think we're focused on it, and I think we're doing a good job of it,
and I think we'll stay in front of it.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's really helpful. And you mentioned budgeting process. I'd be interested in hearing how the
budgeting process for 2022 might be tempered given the circumstances on the supply chain? Would it be
the top line kind of being -- these rolling pushouts? Would it also be margins with the labor issues? Just
how does this all change your planning assumptions for 2022? And then maybe if you could just give us a
comment on October, that would be helpful also.

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Okay. Yes, I'll talk about, I guess, our preliminary thoughts on 2022. And as you know, Deane, we operate
in niche markets, and we have a comprehensive budgeting process that allows us to understand the
market dynamics of these niches in a detailed level. And we begin that process later this month and that
process is going to inform our guidance for 2022. In terms of the macro setup, we believe the economic
recovery continues. We think, overall, it's a good macro environment for us. We think the mid-cycle
recovery continues. We think that we'll start to see longer cycle improvement in our commercial aero
businesses. Our process industries will continue to recover. We're expecting a stable defense spending
environment.

In terms of some of the headwinds that you mentioned, the challenges from inflation are going to
continue, and we're going to have to continue to offset inflation with price. And the supply chain make a
[indiscernible] in growth, mainly in the first half of the year. And as I mentioned before, semiconductor
availability is a key issue for us. And we remain -- the final thing is we remain active in capital deployment
with significant balance sheet capacity with a primary focus on M&A. So we're really bullish about what
we're going to be able to accomplish in 2022. And there's a couple of challenges out there, headwinds,
mainly the supply chain that we're actively managing on, but we're still feeling good about 2022.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

And comments on October?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. The comments on the cadence though quarter in October. Yes, September was the strongest month
of the quarter. It was also the strongest month of the year-to-date and sale -- in orders and sales grew
sequentially through the quarter, with September being the strongest month of the quarter. And October
was very solid. It was supportive of the trend required to meet our guide for Q4. So we're very pleased
with how October turned out and it showed no slowdown at all.

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Can you give some additional color on revenue by end markets
and geography?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Sure. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that it was a broad-based growth. And I'll take a walk around
the company, David. And you look at our process businesses, they were up high teens on a percentage
basis in the third quarter, and they were driven by low teens organic sales growth and the contribution
from the acquisition of Magnetrol. And our process businesses continue to see broad-based growth
with particularly strong growth within our Ultra Precision Technologies businesses as new products and
their differentiated measurement technologies are really driving solid demand across a wide range of
markets, including the semiconductor and optics market. And for the full year for process, we now expect
to be up low double digits versus the prior year. Our next major market segment is the aerospace and
defense market. And overall, we were up 55% in the third quarter, driven by solid organic sales and the
contribution from the acquisition of Abaco.

Organic sales were up high single digits on a percentage basis versus the prior year and solid growth in
our commercial aftermarket business and our business jet businesses. Those were the 2 areas of strong
growth. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our aerospace and
defense businesses. And we expect our defense businesses to be up high single digits and our commercial
businesses to be up low singles. So the defense business is still stronger, but it's moderating a bit, and
the commercial business has had a good quarter. Go to the Power & Industrial market segment next.
Up nearly 40% in the quarter driven by mid-20s organic sales growth so they had a very good quarter.
Also, acquisitions from NSI and Crank Software contributed. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-teens
organic growth for our Power and Industrial businesses.

And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. And both overall and organic sales were up
approximately 25%, accelerating from the prior quarter. Sales across our automation businesses remained
robust with strong demand continuing in their end markets. And for all of '21, we now expect organic
sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis
with stronger growth across our automation businesses and our Engineered Solutions business. So the
automation business is doing very well.

As customers want to remove labor from their processes, they want to move things contamination-free.
We're at capacity. We've invested in the past in the right technologies that are winning share. So -- and
we're very good at moving things quickly and precisely. So the automation business is in a really good
position with a strong backlog and we're bullish about the future. You mentioned geography. I'll go around
the geographies. So we've had strong broad-based growth across geographies, where every geography
was up. The U.S. was up 15%. Europe was up 15%, and the star for the quarter was Asia, it was up 25%
with broad-based strength and notable strength in our process and automation businesses in Asia. Does
that answer your question, David?

David Emerson Ridley-Lane
BofA Securities, Research Division

Perfectly. And then just a quick follow-up. You sort of alluded to it earlier in talking about mid-cycle. This is
a pretty strange cycle. So maybe just can you talk about some of the areas that you are looking for better
organic growth in 2022 versus '21? imagine that the -- some traditional longer cycle areas like commercial
aero and oil and gas but also maybe in this particular cycle, things that are tied to patient volumes and
that sort of stuff.

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. I mean it's -- you mentioned 3 of the areas that I think are improving our commercial aerospace
business. So we'll definitely improve our oil and gas business, it's only about 5% of AMETEK now, but
it was up mid-teens in the quarter. And given where oil and gas prices are, we're beginning to see the
signaling of the project business returning in 2022. So we're feeling good about that. And in terms of the

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

health care business, health care is 15% of AMETEK now. So it's our largest end market vertical. We were
up mid-teens in the quarter. We had really solid growth in our Rauland business and our record business
really driven by new products in record.

And the electrosurgery business, it picked up for us in Q3. So we were up in the quarter. It wasn't
up 15%, it was up high single digits, and we're benefiting from elective surgeries in things like
neurostimulation, cardiac-mapping, catheters, all that stuff as people are going back to hospitals, getting
those procedures done, and we expect that to grow -- this quarter was a high single-digit kind of number.
We expect that to grow more next year. So you hit the key issues, commercial aerospace, oil and gas, the
medical elective surgeries. But I don't think the mid-cycle is not growing yet either, and we're starting to
see acceleration in that business across some of our process businesses.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.

Christopher D. Glynn
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Dan, so results really answer a lot of questions in principle. I was actually curious, any particular areas of
share gain or areas of market space creation you want to comment on? You mentioned automation a little
bit, just kind of looking to expand on those.

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. I mean the -- I would say that when you tend to deliver, your customers give you more orders. And
that's the key issue that's driving our business right now. And when I look at the automation business, I
talked about that earlier, that business is doing extremely well because the broader macro, people want
to remove labor from their processes. They don't want to be dependent on labor because, in some places,
you can't hire labor and difficult to maintain. You're at capacity now. So there's more automation in both
discrete automation and factory automation. We've invested in the right technologies in the last few years
and acquired the right businesses. And when we put them together, we have a really compelling value
proposition, and we can design, customize subassemblies that do automation very quickly and efficiently.
And that business is doing the right things right now. So we're pretty bullish on the outlook for it. Does
that answer your question, Chris?

Christopher D. Glynn
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division

Yes. I was curious if there were any other particular areas, even if more illustrative than moving the
top line by themselves because maybe it's in a discrete niche business but might speak to illustrate the
AMETEK growth model?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Right. I think another area that we're starting to see traction in is some of our sustainability solutions.
And if you look at our sustainability report, we've done some good work highlighting them. But in the case
of greenhouse gas emissions and trying to understand that, we have some instrumentation that's very
unique in helping researchers understand the trajectories. So in terms of China, the pollution generated
from heavy industrial processes requires very durable emissions equipment. That emissions equipment
is selling very well for us now in China. So the sustainability solutions will be another thing that we're
starting to get our hands around but it's growing pretty rapidly.

Unknown Analyst

Congrats on the awesome quarter. I'm on for Nigel Coe. So really around M&A, do you see any updated
thoughts around M&A accretion in fiscal year '22 from your deals this year?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

No, I think the -- we had talked about the M&A accretion being about $0.18 from deals this year. And I
think that we're still in line to deliver that. And the businesses that we have acquired, we're very pleased
with them. And they're -- each of these businesses is going to benefit from a custom playbook developed
for them as part of our integration process, and we'll also benefit from AMETEK's global footprint.
And it's early in the ownership, but so far, they're integrating nicely and we're very bullish with all the
businesses. I think in terms of 2022, I'm going to throw that in the bucket of we're going to go through
and analyze everything from the -- all of our business units with our detailed budgeting process. And once
we understand everything, we'll come back and communicate that to you.

Unknown Analyst

Got you. And then around EIG sales for the quarter, do you see that normal seasonal uptick in sales for
fourth quarter?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

There is a bit of seasonality for EIG in the fourth quarter, so you'll see a bit of that.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Shlosh with Vertical Research.

Andrew Shlosh

It's Andrew Shlosh for Jeff Sprague. Just a couple of quick ones for me. You said the elective surgery
business was up high single digits. Do you have a great feel for where elective procedure volumes are
versus 2019?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I can't comment on that right now. I can tell you that the business in the first half of the year was -- it was
about flattish for us to down a bit. It picked up in Q3 in the high single-digit range, and we expect further
growth from here, and that's probably the best I'm going to be able to give you.

Andrew Shlosh

Right. No, that makes sense. I apologize if I missed it. Did you kind of give ratable of some of the end
market detail on the research business?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

I didn't specifically give the research. It's within our Process segment. The research business is about
10% of AMETEK. And what you see in that business is it's starting to grow again as people -- industrial
research has been strong, but the university research has been impacted by COVID and people are getting
back to the university research environment and is starting to function normally. And I think the product
introduction that we talked about with Gatan is perfectly targeted in that market. So it's a good market for
us. It's not up as much as the AMETEK average, but we're bullish on that market as it begins to heal and
they get back to more normal business after COVID.

AMETEK, INC. FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 02, 2021

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Ken Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

It's Ken Newman on for Steve. I think you had mentioned an increase in the RD&E guidance for the year.
I'm curious if you could just talk about how much growth was driven by new products in the quarter. And
any color on what the Vitality Index has been?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Right. It's a good question, Ken. In the quarter, our Vitality Index was 24%, so a pretty healthy level
for us. And as I mentioned last quarter, we increased our spending on R&D and also on the sales and
marketing initiatives that we have. And we have a lot of things that we're funding, and we're bullish
and optimistic on them. So we're spending about 5.5% of sales. It's a healthy amount for an industrial
business, but we think it gives us a couple of things. One is in these new sales from -- new product sales
but also it gives us the ability to raise price because we're investing for our customers, and we're going to
have the latest products that have the most value for our customers. So the investments that we make,
we also link to the pricing capability in our business. So that's an important factor for us.

Ken Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Okay. And when I think about the impact of shifting sales from out of the third quarter into the next one
because of supply chain issues, does that impact the mix of new products coming to market at all? Or
would you still expect any kind of material expansion in that Vitality Index?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. I think 24% is a pretty good level, but I'd like to say it -- mid-20s is probably what we're targeting.
And I think the -- in terms of new product introductions, to the extent that a new product introduction
relies on electronics or semiconductors, it could be delayed, but it's more broader than new products.
It's across -- the semiconductor chip availability is the one area, in particular, that we're very focused on
because of the challenges with this constrained supply.

Ken Newman
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Right. And that kind of segues pretty well in my follow-up question. Just on the semiconductor shortage.
Obviously, you've got a very diverse set of businesses that spreads the gamut of computing needs. As we
think of the kinds of chips needed for the embedded compute business in Abaco versus your automation
business, can you just give us an idea of how much of the semi exposure is toward more of the bleeding
edge chips versus the trailing edge?

David A. Zapico
Chairman of the Board & CEO

Yes. I think the microprocessors and the higher-end chips or the ones that are particularly -- the chip
availability is particularly an issue right now, but we have such a broad-based portfolio of products. And
we're using different chips in different businesses. So there's really not one chip or one product. It's just
-- it's not in the passive components. It's an active component, and it's in more of the microprocessors
but it affects our EIG business more than EMG. But that's something that we're focused on, and we did
a great job managing it in Q3. And as I said, we have a lot of people that we have relationships that will
build over a long period of time. We're using our purchasing leverage. And probably most importantly, if a
product's not available, we use our engineering capability to qualify second sources, to find alternatives.
We set up a group within our company. It's both our Bangalore engineers and some of our engineers in
Europe and some of our engineers and the U.S. And there's a team that's quickly going through these
things when product availability comes through. So one of the things that we've been able to differentiate

versus maybe some other people in the market is we have the strong engineering capability that can work
on these problems as they come up and solve them quickly.
