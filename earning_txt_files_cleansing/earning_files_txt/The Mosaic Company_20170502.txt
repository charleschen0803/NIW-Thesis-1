Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you all
Today, I'll briefly review our segment performance for the quarter and take you through the reasoning behind our second quarter guidance
In Phosphates, shipment volumes were at the top end of our guidance range due to continuing strong global demand and expectations of a strong spring application season in North America
Prices were in the middle of our guidance range and our operating rate was 79%, which was also in line with our expectations
The Phosphates margin rate was below our guidance primarily due to an unplanned mechanical issue at our Faustina Louisiana ammonia plant where we experienced a failure in a converter two months before a planned turnaround
The plant was down for several weeks towards the end of the quarter, so some of the costs related to the downtime are reflected in our current quarter's results
Additionally, we had to buy more ammonia on the spot market just after ammonia prices had risen significantly
The combined negative impact on gross margin was $14 million or 1.7 percentage points
The plant will complete its scheduled turnaround and is expected to be up and running by mid-May, so ammonia costs will continue to run higher in our Phosphates segment in the second quarter
Our guidance for the second quarter reflects the higher selling prices we are seeing in the market today and robust shipments with continued strong global demand as well as higher operating rates
We expect the second quarter margin rate to increase compared to the first quarter, but we also expect that it will be negatively impacted by the higher ammonia costs I just reviewed and, to a lesser extent, the weather-related issues that have hampered our operations at our joint venture mine in Peru
The western coast of South America has experienced record rainfall over the past two months which resulted in severe flooding that had major impacts on infrastructure and the people living in the area
The Miski Mayo mine, which was down for parts of March and April, is back to production now
As the weather issues played out, we and our joint venture partners have joined together to provide critical relief for the mine's employees and the surrounding community
To ensure that we could keep our Louisiana plant running to meet demand, we purchased third-party rock
This was a temporary development and we do not expect long-term implications for rock supply or for costs
For the second quarter, we expect realized DAP prices to range from $320 to $340 per tonne with volumes in the range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes
We expect gross margin to improve to approximately 10%
As we get into the second half, we see a continuation of gradual improvement in Phosphate margins, as we realize the benefits of higher industry stripping margins, improving cost control and more normal operating rates at Faustina and Miski Mayo
The second half margins will also reflect purchases of ammonia under the CF contract as we expect to begin taking product in early September
In the Potash business, our operating rates were lower than expected because of the incident with a skip at the Esterhazy K2 mine
K2 is back up and running now, but we expect the incident to reduce our second quarter shipments by approximately 200,000 tonnes
Our Potash shipment volumes were below guidance for this quarter because of a Canpotex train derailment and weather-related port loading delays
Approximately 150,000 tonnes that we expected to recognize in the first quarter have been recognized in the second quarter
Our Potash gross margin rate fell short of our guidance
There are two main reasons for the shortfall in margin rate and margin dollars
First, roughly $22 million of costs associated with the skip incident were reflected in the current quarter's results
And second, lower than expected sales volumes due to the Canpotex-related logistics issues I just highlighted reduced per unit profitability
Otherwise, as Joc noted, our excellent cost control in the Potash business unit continued
For the second quarter, we expect Potash shipment volumes in the range of 2.0 million to 2.3 million tonnes, with strong demand persisting
Prices are expected to rise modestly to a range of $170 to $185 per tonne, and margins are expected to improve to the low 20% range
Moving on to the International Distribution segment, results were generally in line with our guidance
We sold 1.3 million tonnes of product and realized a gross margin per tonne of $21 in our international markets
International Distribution sales volumes are expected to be in a range of 1.4 million to 1.7 million tonnes in the second quarter, while margins are expected to remain in the $20 per tonne range
Our full year guidance ranges have not changed
Beginning in 2017, we have changed our depreciation method from straight line to a units-of-production method for certain mining assets to more appropriately reflect the utility of these assets
The change in depreciation method to a units-of-production method is consistent with our peers and will be more comparable going forward
In connection with the change, with the increased focus on mechanical integrity and capital expenditures, we have taken action to allow us to operate our assets over a longer period of time and have extended the lives where appropriate
As a result, we expect an approximate $70 million non-cash P&L benefit in 2017 from a reduction in depreciation expense
Before I conclude, a couple of notes on the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition
First, we are planning to issue debt to finance the cash portion of the purchase price in the late summer timeframe
And second, we expect to change our segment reporting post close
We will give you plenty of notice before our first reporting cycle under the new structure and we plan to provide adequate historical detail
To summarize, we are continuing to focus on the things we can control
We are controlling our costs and we are making prudent capital decisions to ensure we can deliver strong shareholder value in the future
We expect meaningfully better results in the second quarter and the second half of this year
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks
Joc?
Vincent, I think that absent some of the issues that we saw in Louisiana, we probably would have had a couple of percentage point improvement to gross margin
As we look forward to the second quarter, our guidance for the gross margin rate of approximately 10% does take into account some of the additional costs that we will incur in the second quarter related to that same issue
And then going forward, we do see an improving market environment on a gradual basis on the pricing side and, hopefully, some tapering off of the recent run-up in raw material costs
And so, as we look towards the second half of the year, I think 10% in the second quarter or something hopefully a little bit better than that in the second half is what we would be expecting
So, Don, just a reminder, this is a producer-type sharing relationship that we have with CF and so there are going to be times where we're going to be in the money and there will be times when we are out of the money
And as Corrine just said, not long ago, ammonia prices were $40, $50 lower than where they are right now
And in that environment, we were probably out of the money relative to what we were going to be paying CF under the contract
But it's a very volatile market and, with that uptick, now, it's closer to parity is what I would say
I think the bigger issue that we want to keep in mind here as well is we just are commissioning a brand new ammonia vessel and tug, and that's been a project that has been long in the works
Those pieces of equipment are in the water in a testing mode right now
And we believe, long-term, that is going to be very beneficial for Mosaic to arbitrage and basically keep down where world ammonia prices go for the betterment of our overall phosphate business
Because as you know, the relationship that we have with CF is only for about 1/3 of our ammonia requirements compared to the additional 1.2 million tonnes that we're still buying in the marketplace
This is a project that has been in the works for a long period of time
Obviously, you can't make a change like this without a lot of work that goes into the analysis
There's no simple one answer to your question because asset categories change and they vary
And we had a comprehensive review of all of our asset classifications and what the estimated useful life was for each of the categories
Some of them changed
Some of them were lengthened
Some of them did not change at all
And so, it really depends on what you're looking at
I would say, when you take a look at how we went about reviewing this and the move to the unit of production methodology, we're probably still far more conservative than some of our peers are in terms of the useful life that we would assign to our assets
And the fact of the matter is, is that we've been through a significant mechanical integrity program over the last several years
We have maintained our assets very well
We are reducing our capital expenditures across the board as you know
And it's our full expectation that we're going to be using these assets for a longer period of time in the future
And that's just some background and color in terms of the depreciation change
And, Adam, just one
This is Rich
One thing to supplement, keep in mind that these plants, it's not like you turn a key and all of a sudden you're producing 3 million tonnes of product on an annual basis
The modern project will start producing phosphate some time during the second half of 2017. We probably estimate anywhere from 300,000 tonnes to 500,000 tonnes of production this year and then that project will be ramping up for the vast majority of 2018. And so, if you take the first project as any example in terms of how that has progressed, it's going to be a period of time before that is operating at, call it, 85% or higher operating rates
Silke, the first quarter, we have made the change and you see about $20 million of benefit in terms of reduced depreciation
And in terms of the mix, keep in mind that we had the skip failure, which resulted in some downtime in the potash business in the first quarter and therefore, that's probably why you're seeing more of the benefit on the phosphate side
Howard, I'm just taking a look at it here
So, in Q1 of 2017, our D&A was $159 million and the same quarter a year ago, it was $184 million
I hope that's responsive to your question
