Well, thank you, Barb, and good morning, everyone
Thanks for joining us today
So this morning, I will give you a recap of our performance for the second quarter, including some updates on a few key developments of the company
And then, I'll hand it over to Jerry Norcia, who will provide a bit more detail on our progress, particularly at our non-utility businesses
And then finally, Peter will provide a financial review, wrap things up, and then we'll take the Q&A
So moving on to slide 5, on the first quarter call, I said that we were off to a really strong start in 2017, and I will just reiterate that at the halfway point of the year
This past quarter was successful on a number of fronts for the company, including our financial performance
So, I feel very good about our financial results over the first half of the year
And based on those results, we are increasing our 2017 earnings guidance midpoint by $0.11 a share to $5.42. I also say that I'm confident in our ability to deliver on that increased guidance, and on our ability to continue to deliver similar results longer term
So, I think many of you are aware that back in May, we announced a sustainability initiative that commits DTE to reducing its carbon emissions by over 80% by 2050 with interim commitments to reduce levels on the path along the way to that ultimate goal
So this announcement was a defining event for DTE
It set the course for our power generation investments for many years to come
Interestingly, the announcement was really widely covered in the press with over 200 articles and publications nationwide picking it up
The sentiment of the coverage was very positive, and I'll talk a little bit more about the specifics of the carbon reduction initiative here in a few minutes
Investment in our utilities, of course, is central to the growth of the company, and we continue to execute our plan to invest both to transform our generation fleet and also to fundamentally improve reliability in both our gas and electric distribution operations
A commitment to minimizing the impact of those investments on customer rates is a key part of the plan, and it's critical to us continuing to be highly ranked in customer satisfaction amongst our peers
And in that vein, I'm proud to say that our electric utility ranked second in J
Power's Residential Customer Satisfaction Study that was announced earlier this month
And that marked a seventh consecutive year that DTE is ranked in the top quartile for large Midwest electric utilities, and we've improved our absolute customer satisfaction score every year for the past five years
Moving on to the non-utility front
As I said, I'll touch briefly on a few things and then Jerry will provide more detail
Our Bluestone Pipeline achieved a considerable milestone this quarter
The pipe is now delivering 1 Bcf of gas per day, which is more than three times the amount of gas it delivered five years ago, when we put the pipe into service
It was delivering 0.3 Bcf back then
So, we've seen quite amazing growth
And that growth at Bluestone has been driven by the quality of the reserves that it serves
And this growth gives us confidence in the potential for future expansions at Link and NEXUS, which we believe serve similarly strong geology and strong reserves
Moving on to a NEXUS update, I know many of you are interested in the progress and the timing of this project
So, before I get into that, and get into the timing, I'll reiterate what I said on the first quarter call, and that is that the precise in-service date for NEXUS doesn't materially impact our 2017, 2018 or long-term EPS profile
So, we want to get moving on the project, but near-term earnings are not the driver of that desire
So that said, as you know, the FERC quorum has not yet been restored
And as I said on the first quarter call, we expected a year-end 2017 in-service date if we received a FERC certificate by the end of the second quarter or sometime within reach of midyear
We also said on the first quarter call that if the FERC certificate wasn't received within that timeframe, then the project might push into 2018. Well, that's where we are now, with a in-service date in 2018. And Jerry Norcia will give more color on the FERC dynamics in a few minutes
But even though the process is taking longer than we'd like, we're still feeling very good about the project itself
We continue to make progress on the pipeline in the interim
So we have all the materials and equipment, nearly all the right-of-way easements, we're in the final stages of obtaining the necessary permits, and our construction contracts are in place
So to put it plainly, we're completing the steps that are in our control to complete during this period
And once we receive the FERC certificate, we will go immediately to work, and we will, at that time, provide a more precise projected in-service date
Moving on to our power and industrial business, a quick summary is that, we closed on a second landfill gas plant, and are close to finalizing the agreement on the large-scale central plant that we announced last quarter
And these projects, along with a landfill gas acquisition that we announced last quarter, will help cover the REF earnings roll-off that begins in four to five years
So now moving on to slide 6, I want to tell you more about the sustainability initiative and the carbon emission reduction goals that we recently announced
So, as I mentioned, we are committed to reducing carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2050, and that's the target and the timeframe that scientists have broadly settled on
So the slide shows our CO2 emission reduction plan versus 2005 levels
2005 is the year everybody uses as the benchmark
We'll achieve a 30% reduction by the early 2020s, when we retire several coal-fired plants and start up a gas-combined cycle plant, a 45% reduction by 2030, a 75% reduction by 2040, when our final coal plant closes, and a more than 80% reduction by 2050. These reductions interestingly exceed the targets established by the now shelved Clean Power Plan
To replace our aging coal facilities, we'll add about 3,500 megawatts of natural gas-fired capacity, that will supply the 24/7 power and ensure reliability
The first of these gas plants is in motion now
So we have received several bids in response to our request for proposal for the acquisition of existing generation plants, and we're currently evaluating those bids
As we look also at a self-build option, and then compare the two to determine the best solution to meet the needs of our customers
And our final decision will be integrated into the Certificate of Necessity filing that will be made at the end of this month, so in a matter of days
We're also planning to construct on the order of 4,000 megawatts of additional renewable energy capacity over time
The next major renewable investments on that path will occur in 2018 and in 2020. As I said earlier, I believe this carbon reduction plan is a defining initiative for DTE
And I also believe that our sector more broadly would be well served to get out in front of the carbon issue and take it head-on
And I say this, because, ultimately, the transition from coal to natural gas and renewables and from oil to electricity in the transportation sector is one of the best and strongest growth opportunities that our industry has
And further, I'm convinced that we and the industry can pull off this transition in a way that maintains affordability, that maintains the currently strong competitive position of the U.S
energy complex
And I feel confident saying that, because the plan we've announced has been in the works for several years, and we have studied and modeled the transition very, very carefully
If there's anything we do at DTE, we run the numbers, and we're convinced that it can be done affordably
So, don't get me wrong, there are ways to go about this transition that could be expensive for customers
Other countries have proven that
Germany is a clear example
They blew it
But it doesn't have to be that way
And in Michigan, we're committed to going about this transition the right way to ensure that we achieve not only the sustainability goals, but the affordability goals as well
And with that, I'll hand it over to Jerry Norcia, who will give you an update on our non-utility businesses
You're talking about the increase we just gave in 2017. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC For 2017. Yeah
One thing to remember about that pipeline is it had capacity available for producers to expand into
So one of the key jobs was to fill up that volume, and as Jerry just said, we're feeling very encouraged by the pace of drilling and the level of activity in the area, and the growth we're seeing on the pipe
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
And just to confirm also that we're still at 1.75 Bcf for the, it's the backlog of interconnect agreements, right, on NEXUS? Has that number changed, or are we still two-thirds contracted at this point?
Still two-thirds contracted, and, yes, the 1.75 Bcf of interconnect agreements is what we have
Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
Thank you very much
We've got – as you mentioned, we've got significant interconnectivity along the NEXUS Pipeline, that I think will yield more firm contracts
In terms of timing, a lot of the conversations are revolving around providing those potential shippers with certainty as when the pipeline will go into service
And I think the moment that we get a FERC certificate and we start construction, we'll start to move to close on some of those firm service agreements
So I think step one in working with the commission is work we're doing on a distribution investment plan
So we were asked by the commission to file a five-year look at distribution investments
And we took that as a very positive collaborative effort
They understand that we need to invest to modernize the system, to automate the system, to improve reliability and so forth, and it's a significant investment
So, the filing is really for them to understand it better and for the commission and DTE to be on the same page
That's step one
The second question is, how to fund that construction? And I think there is some interest on both sides for alternative mechanisms for the portions of that build that are straightforward and well understood, once the plan is well understood
But I guess I'd say, I wouldn't put the cart before the horse, so to speak
We want to get a good plan that's understood by the commission
And then if we can put a recovery mechanism in place that helps both sides, that's great; if not, we'll proceed as normal
I'd expect those sorts of discussions to be – about recovery mechanisms to potentially be playing out next year, after we work our way through the distribution plan this year
Well, that would be one of the advantages, would be to spread out the time between cases and keep the cases focused on the things that really are out of normal, so to speak
So if we can have routine things covered in tracking mechanisms and the non-routine things covered in cases, that would be ideal
But, again, I think that's an agenda we'll work next year once we've got greater clarity on – an agreement on the investment agenda itself
