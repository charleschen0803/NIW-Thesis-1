Presentation

Operator

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Flowserve Corporation Third Quarter
2020 Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions]

Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]

Now it's my pleasure to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Jay Roueche, Treasurer and
Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

John E. Roueche
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, Carmen, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you participating in our conference call
today to discuss Flowserve's 2020 third quarter financial results. On the call with me this morning are
Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amy Schwetz, Senior Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer.

Following our prepared comments, we will open the call for questions. And as a reminder, this event is
being webcast, and an audio replay will be available. Please also note that our earnings materials do and
this call will, include non-GAAP measures and contain forward-looking statements. These statements are
based on forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of November 6, 2020,
and they involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. We encourage
you to fully review our safe harbor disclosures as well as the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to
our reported results, both of which are included in our press release and earnings presentation and are
accessible on our website at flowserve.com in the Investor Relations section.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive
Officer, for his prepared comments.

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Great. Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call.
We are pleased with how Flowserve is responding to the dramatic and unprecedented change in 2020.
COVID-19 continues to impact our lives on a global scale, which is impacting Flowserve's end markets and
changing the way we run our company on a day-to-day basis.

Considering the current environment, I truly appreciate the dedication and commitment demonstrated by
Flowserve's leaders and associates, and especially those on the front line working in our manufacturing
facilities and QRCs who continue to fully support our customers each and every day. While we have had
associates directly impacted by COVID, our strict adherence to the operating policies and procedures we
implemented earlier in the year, prevented any Flowserve to Flowserve transmission from recurring in our
facilities during the quarter. We are pleased with this outcome, and we remain committed to the safety of
our associates.

However, it is important to acknowledge that the additional safety protocols and the disruption and have
an incremental cost and impact on our overall productivity levels. Despite our best efforts in investment
and ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers, COVID continues to cause sporadic
disruptions within our facilities. In the third quarter, our Indian and Mexican operations were the most
challenged regions, where we have several large manufacturing facilities. However, today, all of our
locations are operational and providing support to our customers. The recent rise in COVID related cases
in Europe and the United States is concerning. We're doing everything possible to keep these facilities

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

open and operational throughout the fourth quarter and beyond, and we believe our system and processes
will continue to keep our associates safe and productive.

Before Amy covers our financials in detail, I would like to address our results at a high level. Overall, we
are pleased with our execution during the quarter. Flowserve delivered adjusted earnings per share of
$0.5, in line with our expectations. These solid earnings also reflect the significant cost actions we have
implemented this year.

End of the quarter, adjusted SG&A decreased $30.8 million year-over-year to $193 million. We continue to
track ahead of our $100 million cost-out program for full year 2020 compared to last year's cost structure.
As we communicated previously, these savings are about half from discretionary measures and half
from structural actions we have taken. In addition to the SG&A savings, we are working hard to reduce
our product cost through supply chain savings and to maintaining higher levels of productivity in our
manufacturing locations.

Our Flowserve 2.0 transformation program continues to deliver solid operational execution, limiting
the decline in our adjusted operating margin to 60 basis points on a $71.4 million revenue decrease
versus third quarter 2019, resulting in decremental margins of 19.5% in the quarter. We are confident as
additional Flowserve 2.0 process improvement initiatives are implemented within the organization, we will
capture more margin enhancement opportunities through further cost actions, manufacturing productivity
and product cost reductions.

Let me now turn to our segment level performance in the third quarter. FPD's bookings decreased 22.6%,
while sales decreased 1.8% as we executed on its strong backlog. The bookings decline was driven by
original equipment down 37%, while aftermarket bookings were more resilient at a decline of 12%. Oil
and gas bookings were down 45% year-over-year, primarily due to a nearly $60 million decline in project
awards. FPD's adjusted margins were in line with expectations, including the 110 basis point improvement
in adjusted operating margin to 14.1%. Despite the modest revenue decline, adjusted operating income
increased approximately 6.8% to $94.5 million, demonstrating solid operating performance, which more
than offset the headwind of a 400 basis point mix shift towards original equipment.

Aggressive cost actions drove a $22 million decrease in adjusted SG&A and a 280 basis point decrease in
adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to 18.7%. FCD's bookings and sales were down 16% and 18.7%,
respectively. Oil and gas, power and general industries were both primary drivers or one of the primary
drivers, down 30%, 20% and 12%, respectively.

Additionally, within general industries, the North American distribution channel continues to be challenged
as spending has been impacted by COVID and commodity price declines. FCD's adjusted gross and
operating margins were 30.3% and 12.2%, respectively. While these are not the results we typically
expect from the business, I am confident that our focus on execution, cost reduction, backlog conversion
and inventory reduction will drive fourth quarter margins above their second and third quarter levels.

Turning now to bookings. As expected, our third quarter bookings of $806 million was generally in line
with second quarter levels and represented a 21% decline year-over-year. As you may recall, last year's
third quarter included strong oil and gas project activity in the Middle East and Asia Pacific as well as a
number of smaller projects awards, which together totaled roughly $140 million. By contrast, the largest
award we received in the 2020 third quarter was $12 million. And when combined with our other small to
medium-sized project awards, the sum represented less than $60 million of project awards. On a positive
note, we didn't have any material cancellations in backlog in the quarter.

Third quarter aftermarket activity remained relatively stable with bookings of $424 million, down 32.5%,
modestly better or modestly below our expectations. While customers continue to spend to meet safety
and regulatory requirements, upgrade and productivity investment remained muted and larger scale
turnaround and maintenance activity continue to face cohort related headwinds with limitations due to site
access.

Original equipment bookings in the quarter were $381 million, down 28% versus prior year and up about
4% sequentially. Large projects, which typically accounts for 10% to 15% of our business remain the most

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

challenged. The majority of these projects have been delayed and are currently being reevaluated. Our
customers' project spending decisions will largely depend on the status of the COVID environment. The
bookings level over the last 2 quarters accurately represents the current market environment, and we
expect bookings in the fourth quarter and likely the first quarter of 2021 to be similar to this year's second
and third quarter.

Given what we know today, I am increasingly optimistic that we begin to return to bookings growth next
year as the world moves beyond the COVID crisis. We should see it first in our aftermarket bookings
ahead of an inflection in project bookings, but we expect both to be better in the back half of 2021. On the
aftermarket side, we feel there is pent-up demand building for parts and services and expect that growth
in the -- in this area to incur earlier than the project business. We are beginning to see signs of increased
aftermarket spending in 2021 as operators are planning for maintenance and turnaround events.

Let me now address our served end markets. Our oil and gas markets continue to be the most impacted
due to COVID related declines in energy demand. Third quarter bookings declined 42% year-over-year
and were roughly flat sequentially. Last year's third quarter presented a challenging compare figure due
to the strong project environment at that time, which included several larger awards related to IMO 2020
upgrade activity. 2019 third quarter included over $90 million of project awards. This quarter, our largest
project awarded in oil and gas was just $12 million.

Third quarter chemical bookings were down 21.6% in the quarter, primarily driven by FPD's 31% decline,
while FCD's bookings were down only 5%. The quarter included one smaller award of $4 million in Asia
Pacific. Our integrated customers continued to delay petrochemical investment, while specialty chemical
demand presents growing opportunities.

Turning to power. While the power market continues to be challenged, it has not declined as much as oil
and gas or the chemical markets. Third quarter and year-to-date bookings are down just 7.5% and 9.2%,
respectively. The quarter includes a few small lucrative awards totaling $9 million and a $4 million fossil
fuel award in Asia.

The digital industries market, which includes a significant level of distribution and was our most challenged
end market in 2019, continued to show signs of recovery in the third quarter with bookings up 18.6%
and up 5.9% year-to-date. FPD's 31% increase was partially offset by FCD's 11.5% decline, driven by
the continued MRO slowdown in North America. FPD's growth was driven by distribution and food and
beverage growth.

Finally, representing our smallest market, water bookings decreased $41 million or 66%. Last year's third
quarter was particularly strong, including over $20 million in awards for a large Middle East desalination
project. While the 2020 third quarter included only 1 project award of $6 million in North America, we
continue to expect investment opportunities from desalination, flood control and municipal water markets.
Regionally, our largest dollar decline was in North America, which has seen a significant impact from
COVID as well as the related downturn in energy demand.

Only Latin America has delivered constant currency bookings growth in 2020, up 6% and 9% in the
third quarter and year-to-date, respectively. We incurred double-digit year-over-year bookings declines
in all other regions. We're seeing the most potential in the Asian markets as mobility has returned to
near-normal levels, demand for processing based products has recovered and infrastructure spending
continues. With limited and highly competitive project opportunities, we continue to focus on improving
our position for winning available work, driving our cost structure lower to offset pricing pressure and
maintaining a quality backlog to increase our installed base and create aftermarket opportunities.

We believe our markets have stabilized and expect fourth quarter bookings to be in line with what we saw
in the second and third quarters of this year.

Let me now turn the call over to Amy to cover our financial results in greater detail before I return to
provide our outlook for the fourth quarter.

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Looking at Flowserve's third quarter financial results in
greater detail, our reported EPS of $0.39 included realignment and transformation expenses as well as
below the line FX charges totaling $0.11. Adjusted EPS of $0.5 was solid, considering we continued to
experience ongoing COVID related headwinds.

Third quarter revenues of $924 million were flat sequentially and down 7.2% versus the prior year. FTD's
revenue declined 1.8% on reduced aftermarket activity, which more than offset strong original equipment
sales growth of 10% through backlog execution. Consolidated OE revenues of $479 million were down
5.6%, where FCD's 21% year-over-year decrease more than offset FPD's strength. Aftermarket revenue
of $445 million was down 8.8%, with both segments down in that general range. In addition to limitations
accessing our customer sites, many of the planned refinery and chemical plant turnarounds that were
expected for this fall were further delayed in the active Gulf Coast hurricane season also caused temporary
closures and disruptions to several of our QRCs as well as our customers' facilities.

Turning to margins. Third quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 230 basis points to 31.5%, including
declines of 180 and 240 basis points at FPD and FCD, respectively. In addition to the previously mentioned
cost increases related to COVID and the associated disruption with our sites, margins were also negatively
impacted by a 100 basis point mix shift towards original equipment revenues as a percentage of our total
sales, driven by FPD's 400 basis point mix shift.

On a reported basis, Flowserve's third quarter gross margins decreased 250 basis points to 30.9%, again
due to COVID disruptions and mix headwinds and a $2 million increase in realignment expenses versus
last year's third quarter.

Third quarter adjusted SG&A decreased $30.8 million or 13.8%, demonstrating our cost control and the
aggressive cost actions we took in the first half of the year. These measures brought $193 million of
adjusted SG&A, down 160 basis points as a percentage of sales to 20.9% versus prior year, which was flat
sequentially. On a reported basis, SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 140 basis points, primarily
due to the cost actions we implemented, considering our adjusted items were relatively flat with prior
year. Third quarter adjusted operating margin decreased 60 basis points versus last year's to 10.9%. With
third quarter adjusted operating income of $100.6 million and a $71.4 million year-over-year revenue
decline, it represents an adjusted decremental margin of approximately 19.5%.

FPD's solid operating performance delivered adjusted operating income growth at the segment level,
even as its revenues declined modestly. As a result, FPD drove 110 basis points increase in its adjusted
operating margin to 14.1%. FCD's adjusted operating margin of 12.2% was below our expectations, driven
by a higher mix of lower-margin project work. With clear visibility and line of sight, we fully expect FCD's
margins to return to around the mid-teen levels in the fourth quarter.

Reported third quarter operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 9.4%, driven primarily by a loss of
leverage on lower revenues and included the benefit of modestly lower adjusted items.

Turning to the cash flow and liquidity. As many of you know, Flowserve's results are traditionally seasonal,
and most of our full year cash flow is delivered in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth
quarter. While our cash flow statement will be published in a few days with our 10-Q, I can say we feel
good -- we feel very good about our cash generation during the quarter. Based on our operating cash flow
of $70 million to $75 million and quarterly CapEx spending, free cash flow for the quarter will be about
$57 million.

This performance as well as the $300 million of net proceeds after our note issuance and tender offer,
brought Flowserve's cash and cash equivalents balanced at September 30 to over $921 million. Even
absent the net proceeds of the bond issuance, Flowserve increased its cash position, $59 million in
the quarter. In future periods, we intend to use some of this excess cash to retire outstanding debt,
considering we have maturities in 2022 and 2023. However, primary working capital as a percent of sales
grew to 30% as inventory, including contract assets and liabilities increased roughly $100 million versus
the prior year. This increase in inventory primarily relates to the strong OE project backlog we built as well
as an increase in shipping manufacturing delays due to COVID-related disruptions in a few of our larger

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

facilities. As a result, COVID has had a greater negative impact on working capital than our revenues
might reflect.

Over the last few years, Flowserve has delivered meaningful improvement in the working capital of the
sales metrics through our transformation initiatives. And despite this quarter's blip, we are confident we
are on the right track and that our performance in the fourth quarter will be much improved. In particular,
we are actively managing and taking discrete measures to reduce the inventory levels to reflect current
demand, and we also have solid visibility to upcoming shipments. It is critical for us to stringently manage
inventory more intensely during challenging points in the cycle than during high growth, and our teams
are incentivized accordingly.

Accounts receivable has demonstrated somewhat better consistency than inventory. DSO was 73 days
in the quarter versus 74 in each of the first 2 quarters of 2020. Although we still see opportunities
for improvement. Despite some COVID-driven slow pay impact this year, we have made significant
improvement in the last 3 years when DSO was 87 days in the third quarter of 2017. And we expect our
transformation initiatives will enable us to reach our target of below 70 days, which given the competitive
environment for payment terms in certain of our end markets would represent strong performance.

In addition to the $500 million notes issuance and tender offer during the third quarter, we also amended
our $800 million senior credit facility to provide Flowserve increased flexibility and ample access to this
source of liquidity.

I want to thank and express my appreciation to our partner banks for their continued support of
Flowserve. We value these relationships and look forward to our ongoing work together. In total, our
quarter end liquidity position increased roughly $370 million sequentially to $1.7 billion, which includes our
cash balance as well as nearly $750 million of available capacity under our amended credit facility, which
remains undrawn.

With the continued progress on our $100 million cost reduction program, combined with the anticipated
working capital improvements, disciplined capital spending and discretionary cost management, we expect
to deliver significant cash from operations in the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our expected major
cash usages in 2020 remain consistent with our prior guidance, including funding our structural cost-
out actions and the realignment and transformation programs. We continue to expect full year capital
expenditures in the $60 million range and annual dividends of roughly $100 million.

Let me close with a brief comment addressing the accounting revision that we disclosed in our press
release yesterday. First, the revision is not the result of a view of increased risk related to asbestos
litigation or any change to our expectations for future cash flow. As part of our third quarter close
procedures, we became aware that our accounting for potential future exposure to asbestos liabilities
related to certain heritage brands deviated from others with similar liabilities. Specifically, as previously
disclosed, we were reporting liabilities only for those claims that were known versus using an actuary to
forecast claims that were possibly incurred, but not reported to the company. As a result, we increased our
liability by $74 million to $101 million in total. This liability is partially offset by $87 million of insurance
coverage booked as a receivable.

Cash from insurance proceeds is received as agreements are reached with carriers. Our revised financial
statements and the filings reflect this incurred, but not reported liability, on the balance sheet as well as
the correction of other immaterial timing items.

Let me now return the call to Scott.

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, Amy. As I said earlier, we are pleased with our performance in this unprecedented year. We
are managing through the COVID pandemic and our operational efforts with Flowserve 2.0 are positively
impacting our downturn performance. The Flowserve 2.0 work is not done and we continue to remain
committed to our transformational program.

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

We have reprioritized certain work streams due to the pandemic driven downturn, and we continue to
make steady progress on further cost reduction plans and preparing for a return to growth. In fact, the
speed, with which we reduced our cost structure by $100 million versus 2019 was possible because of our
success over the last few years, creating a more flexible Flowserve 2.0 operating model.

Most of the structural cost initiatives we implemented midyear were comprised of measures previously
planned as part of the Flowserve 2.0 program that we accelerated. In addition to managing COVID and
executing our downturn playbook, we are making progress on our long-term strategy and our growth
initiatives. Over the last 18 months, we've put a lot of effort in analyzing our end markets and evaluating
our overall product portfolio. Our product teams have made significant progress in our efforts to have a
differentiated offering in attractive markets that have growth potential for years to come.

This year, we have launched 5 new products, introduced 10 product upgrades and put 6 existing products
through the design-to-value process. In the third quarter alone, we launched all of the new products
and expect several more before the end of the year. Included in the new product introductions is a SIHI
branded 2-stage liquid ring compressor designed for a variety of gases and vapors. Our proven technology
enables this product to operate under the most severe conditions, where safety, reliability and special
processes are critical. This compress will be part of the FPD segment.

We also added new capabilities within the FCD segment. During the third quarter, we launched a Valtek
compressor anti-surge valve, which is a revolutionary solution to anti-surge control and LNG processing,
refinery gas compression, natural gas stations and chemical plants using natural gas as a feedstock. This
product will provide operators with an innovative anti-surge design that combines precise control and fast
responsiveness. Additionally, we expanded our Limitorque actuator line with the new MX Series B smart
electric actuator. This IoT-enabled Flow Control solution provides trouble-free commissioning, improved
process control from advanced diagnostic capabilities and reliable operation in multiple industries and
applications. Flowserve has historically been an innovative leader in the Flow Control industry. With
increased confidence in our new product development process, we'll continue to increase our investment in
products and technology.

While we very much believe that oil and gas has a long-term future in the energy mix, we do recognize
the advances in alternative energy technologies. Today, oil and gas represents about 60% of the global
energy mix. With significant investment in renewables through 2040, most still expect oil and gas to
provide more than 50% of the global energy mix. Nevertheless, we are excited about the increasing
investment towards energy transition, reduced emissions and safer living conditions. And virtually every
major industrial process involving liquids or gases, pumps, valves, fields and services are vital to that
infrastructure.

Our products and services are currently used in applications throughout the world to address key
environmental issues such as supplier gas recovery, which reduces methane emissions and increases
process energy efficiency; hydrogen production in the downstream sector; carbon capture and storage to
reduce industrial carbon intensity; process maintenance and services to maximize service life, improve
efficiency and employ local workers; concentrated solar and hydropower; seawater desalination plants for
cost-effective access to freshwater; and flood control to protect coastlines and cities from [indiscernible] .
And as technology advance and considering Flowserve's innovative leadership in the Flow Control industry,
we fully expect to participate in helping make the world a better place for everyone.

I would now like to spend a minute on our environment, social and government efforts, or ESG. Flowserve
continues to improve as a corporation, and we take our ESG program very seriously. Our commitment
to ESG began almost a decade ago when we released our first sustainability report. The vision for our
program starts at the top of our organization with our Board of Directors and senior management. We've
worked together to evolve and develop a comprehensive ESG program focused on 3 pillars: planet, people
and operational excellence.

While we believe our proactive approach to governance has been and continues to be aligned with our
shareholders' best interest, as evidenced by our implementation of best practices, like declassifying
our Board of Directors, improving gender and racial diversity, enacting proxy access and most recently,
implementing the ability for our shareholders to act by less than unanimous written consent.

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Today, I would like to focus more specifically on our environmental initiatives within our ESG program.
Earlier this week, we published our 2020 Sustainability report in which we discuss our commitment
to becoming a continuously improving organization. We also specifically announced a new target for
reducing global CO2 emissions intensity by 40% by 2030 using 2015 as a baseline. In addition to setting
an ambitious target to reduce our own emissions, we intend to utilize both our existing portfolio as well
as developing new products that will help our customers reduce their CO2 emissions and also further
participate in cleaner sources of energy like hydrogen, solar and hydroelectric. At Flowserve, we can make
-- we believe we can make the world a better place through our ESG actions, and setting our emissions
targets and assisting an energy transition are big steps towards doing just that.

Let me close with our fourth quarter outlook. We expect fourth quarter bookings to be in line with the
second and third quarter levels. While anticipating an upward bookings inflection to occur in mid-to-late
2021. We expect to make significant progress converting our $2 billion backlog in the fourth quarter and
deliver our largest revenue quarter of this year. As we have the last 2 quarters, we plan to deliver strong
operating margin decrementals as we effectively manage our cost structure. Fourth quarter decrementals
should be around the 20% level.

Finally, we are forecasting to finish the last quarter of the year with free cash flow generation of at least
$100 million as we reduced primary working capital from the third quarter levels. Those set of results are
traditionally very seasonal during the year with the best performance for revenues, adjusted earnings and
cash flow occurring in the fourth quarter of the year. We expect the 2020 fourth quarter to largely reflect
that trend absent of any COVID-related issues.

I remain confident that our transformation progress will continue to position Flowserve to execute through
cycles at a higher level than previous downturns and capture growth with market recovery, driving long-
term value for our associates, customers and our shareholders.
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we would now like to open the call to any questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Our first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Can we start with the MRO outlook on the oil and gas side? And just your expectations about how long can
the MRO upgrades and maintenance be delayed by the industry? At a certain point, things become either
it's regulatory or safety, but how close are we to that threshold?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Deane, it's an important question. And obviously, that's been impacted by this downturn. And what I
would say is that the regulated and the mandates are still out there, and we're seeing that work progress,
but as operators can make exceptions and push some of that out, which we are seeing. But probably the
biggest impact is just in the discretionary side of it, where you might -- normally, you bring the parts in
when you think that there's an imminent failure or even ahead of that, and we're seeing those decisions
get pushed out.

In my prepared remarks, we talked about -- this will be the first sign of recovery for us. And I truly do
expect that we're going to see 2021 be better than the run rates that we're at right now. And they just
can't hold off on spending a lot of this. And so we don't think we're losing market share. We don't think
others are taking action, but we do think there's just been -- the discretionary side of this has been
clamped down really, really hard.

On the seal side, where it is, if things start to leak between that motor and the pump, they've got to
replace the seals, and so we're seeing that. That business hold up reasonably well. But on the pump parts
and some of the valve parts, that's the area that we've seen a pullback. And so I just think -- and then
the other piece, and I put this in the prepared remarks as well is that we are talking to customers about
major plans in the second half of -- or in 2021 as they're looking to do bigger maintenance-type events or
turnaround activity.

So hopefully, that helps there. But we do think there's pent-up demand. We're having big customers with
-- or discussions with a lot of our top-level customers, and they're confirming that the spending should
come up in 2021.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's really helpful. And you anticipated one of my questions about market share, you don't think there's
been any market share loss. So can I ask about channel in the -- inventory in the channel. Just what's
your sense about the distributors right now on the stocking, destocking continuum?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So the stocking distributors really are in our valve business. And there's a few that are public and
disclose their results. And you can see their inventory levels are down substantially. And so they came in
the -- it really started last year. And so they've been destocking and pulling inventory down but they are
not spending money, right? And what they've said is that they're not going to do major stock orders, and
they're just going to buy and replace on a regular basis. And so until you see a pretty significant inflection
in their business, I don't anticipate major stock awards, but I also think the destocking is done, like, I
mean, their numbers are to helm pretty dramatically. And so I think that's actually, in a weird way, that's

going to help our valve business more than what we saw in Q2 and Q3. But it's not a major uplift until we
start to see an inflection activity.

But I just think they're at kind of the variables of inventory levels, and that will actually help our
bookings within valves. And then on the pump side, we're not seeing -- we don't have as many stocking
distributors. A lot of that more is passed through and they hold just a little bit of inventory. So I don't
think there's a big impact on the pump side.

Deane Michael Dray
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Great. And just lastly, it's more of a comment than a question as I appreciate the transparency and
disclosure about your revised assumptions on the asbestos reserve. That is, a, in the scheme of things
of companies that are facing this issue, it's tiny for you all, and you've got good insurance that you're
showing against it. So I appreciate the transparency, but it looks like a non-issue to us.

Thanks, Deane. We agree with $14 million of net exposure currently on our books, it is a relatively
immaterial change.

Our next question is from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.

Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Scott, just kind of following up on Deane's question and some of your comments on the timing of kind
of replenishment in the backlog with some of this book and ship and maintenance activity that needs
done and likely comes in here in the first half. How much backlog depletion would you expect as we kind
of move through the first half of next year before orders turn positive, I think, in the second half? And I
guess, what would be more than -- you'd be comfortable with relative to kind of normal visibility then?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Joshua, good question, and I just said, it's a really hard one to answer. And it really is with the
backdrop of COVID. And so I think really this fall COVID outbreak in the Northern Hemisphere is going
to really dictate kind of the comfort level and the aggressiveness on when folks can start to spend again.
But I'll just say, as we think about backlog and where that is, we've given some pretty clear direction on
what we see in the fourth quarter. And so you can get to a book and bill type number from there. And
you can see what the backlog looks like. And then it really just becomes a question of when customers
start to spend again. And right now, we do believe that at some point in 2021. And whether it's late Q1,
maybe Q2, that aftermarket and MRO spending starts to happen. And we've got -- having discussions
with our customers, we know there's plans to spend more versus the run rates that we're at now. But
then I wouldn't expect the project activity to pick up dramatically until the back half of 2021. And so it's
just kind of when does that happen. When do operators get comfortable, and a lot of this is just going to
be psychology on how COVID is handled during this kind of uptick in the winter season. And then what
gives them confidence that mobility and demand starts to return. And I think my guess right now and
everything we see is with vaccines and living with this virus, I believe that folks start to get a lot -- in a
much better place in next year at the end of Q2 and early Q3. And so that's really the best I can provide.
And what we're hopeful is, as we kind of get another quarter under our belt, folks get a little more refined
on their 2021 plans. We'll come out at the end of the fourth quarter with some, hopefully -- or at least
we'll provide direction in terms of what we're thinking. And hopefully, we can provide more concrete
guidance on 2021.

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Got it. That makes sense. And then just thinking about the magnitude of MRO spend, and I know a lot of
the timing is subject to site access and COVID and a lot of the moving pieces there. But if I think back to
kind of the '15-'16 time frame, too much got pushed out, and then we had a big catch-up and customer
would say, with the benefit of hindsight, I don't want to do that again. How would you contextualize the
conversations with the management teams of some of these customers? And that is this MRO getting back
to normal practices? Or has there been kind of a snowplow effect of stuff that didn't get done, that all
pushes into a smaller range as you're able to get this work done again?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So I'll just kind of -- I'll reiterate a little bit what I said with Deane. We are having discussions at the
top level of our customers. And I think unanimously, they all understand the impact of what happened in
'15 and '16, and they want to avoid that. I think the difference here is just with COVID and site access
and people working from home, it was in a lot of cases, in a lot of parts of the world, it was physically
impossible to conduct that work. And so I'm optimistic that the MRO and the maintenance side does return
back to the levels that we were operating pre-COVID. And I do think there's some pent-up demand there,
certainly on our parts side. And so I'm probably more optimistic on growth and return here. Again, it's
going to depend on how intense is this kind of winter wave of COVID, and then the psychological impact of
that. And where do they think demand on whatever process industry that they're supporting is. But again,
in our discussions, there are things planned in the first half of 2021, that would be significantly more than
the rate that we're seeing right now. And so we feel pretty good about getting some growth here within
2021.

Our next question comes from John Walsh with Crédit Suisse.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

I wanted to talk a little bit about how to think about even conceptually some type of margin bridge into
next year. I mean you talked about of the actions, I think, you took. Half of them were temporary in
nature. There was another half that was structural. It sounds like you're announcing new products, which
maybe that helps with some price and creating some demand from new products. But can you help us
understand because it seems like you are pointing to a top line headwind, at least, as a base case, just
what we should be thinking about in our margin walk year-over-year as we think about next year and the
tailwinds and the headwinds?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Yes. No, there's a -- it's a complicated situation, right? But I'll give you kind of a little bit of things to
think about. The first one would just be the mix side, right? And so as we kind of get the OE backlog out
and the mix starts to return to a little bit more normal aftermarket versus OE. The aftermarket margins
are obviously higher. And so we'll get a tailwind from that mix. You're also -- that $100 million that we've
talked about is secure. And so you get a tailwind on the cost out there. And then the other thing I'd just
say is the Flowserve 2.0 initiatives that were going before are all still very much in flight. And so we've
made big strides on manufacturing productivity. We're making strides on lean. We're driving our supply
chains to be more cost effective. We talked about on the product side, this design to value. And every time
we put a product through there, we're seeing anywhere from 10% to 20% cost out on the overall landed
cost of the product. And so there's still a lot left in the tank in terms of Flowserve 2.0. And then obviously,
the headwind would be -- the revenues are lower. And so you've got absorption and overhead that we've
got to overcome. And then the other one that we haven't talked about yet is just pricing. And so we are
seeing an impact on pricing in a negative manner as folks are competing for limited work. I would say
it's not across all of our business. It's more imminent in the large projects and particularly on the pump
side. And we're doing everything we can to price things accordingly and accurately that generate value for

Flowserve in the long run. So I think those are kind of the big levers. I'm looking at Amy. Did I miss one,
Amy?

Amy B. Schwetz
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. The only thing that I would clarify, you commented on the $100 million being 50-50 structural and
cost avoidance in 2020. Just as a reminder, we only got about 6 months of the benefit of those structural
changes. So we anticipate that they pull forward into 2021, actually $100 million of run rate savings.

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And then the only other thing I'd just say, just to kind of put a fine point on it is we were pretty
aggressive and quick in the -- really at the end of Q1, beginning of Q2, putting our cost reduction plans
in place. And so we know we can get cost out as our backlog comes down or in the event that something
goes a little bit differently on the booking side than we expect. And so we're going to continue to watch
this, and we'll make sure that the cost structure is where it needs to be in 2021 and beyond.

John Fred Walsh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Great. Maybe we could do the same exercise on kind of free cash flow conversion. Obviously, I know it's a
little bit tougher this quarter just with the way the disclosure worked. But as we think going forward, you
did have the target of 100%, that one I thought was a little bit more back-end loaded, if I remember your
commentary on how you achieve that. What are kind of the big headwinds, tailwinds as you look into next
year from a free cash flow perspective?

Amy B. Schwetz
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. We think that 2020 is a good indication that Flowserve can generate a strong free cash flow in good
and challenging markets. We are seasonal with respect to our cash flow. So as we indicated, we're just
shy of $60 million of free cash flow this quarter. As Scott indicated, we're driving towards the $100 million
or better of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of the year. And realistically, there's been -- we've made
some investments in 2020 that's weighing on those numbers, including the cost that it took to rightsize
the business in the first half of the year. We continue to see working capital and primary working capital
as a huge lever for cash flow generation. As we've indicated or I indicated in my prepared remarks, we
are disappointed with where we landed in the third quarter as a percentage of primary working capital as
a percentage of sales, but we're going to continue to drive that number down. And specifically, where we
sit now, we think there's a huge opportunity with respect to inventory. And that's really our focus area as
we close out the year. And I would comment that, that focus is not just to close the year out strong, but
that's really to reset the bar in terms of where primary working capital should be as a percentage of sales.
And to drive that number to the mid-20s and lower as we pick up momentum. Like everything else, with
respect to transformation initiatives, we plan to provide an update at the end of the year in terms of where
we stand and where we sit with those goals. But we think that free cash flow for that cash flow conversion
of 100% is still where we want to be at as a company.

Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Scott, could you give us some more color into what you're seeing in a couple of your larger end markets?
I think there's some investor concern -- increased investor concern out there that refiners could or are
shutting capacity as demand stays lower for longer. So do you see risk of a more extended downturn in
refining? And then you mentioned that specialty chemical demand is recovering. Do you see chemical-
related projects under aftermarket beginning to come back?

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure, Andy. I would agree. I mean, refineries are challenged right now. You can see that with the
utilization numbers. And then there are operators that are announcing -- some have announced temporary
closures, and some have announced permanent closures as well. What I would say is the closures are
largely in North America and Europe, that would be the smaller refineries that just the economics haven't
worked well for them. And quite frankly, they weren't spending a lot with us in terms of upgrading their
equipment and things like that. But at the same time, the refined product has taken a massive hit as
mobility has grounded to a halt in the early phases of COVID, and it's slowing down again in this wave of
COVID now.

So I think it's a more challenged market. And as we look at our funnel within the Flowserve system, we're
definitely seeing more opportunities in specialty chemical. We're seeing more opportunities in gases. And
you've seen some LNG type awards and discussions and projects moving forward. We're seeing the water
markets progress. And so I think there are -- I think we're going to see more things outside the refinery
early, but I also believe that your refining investment in Asia and the Middle East will definitely continue.
And again, I think that's kind of a second half of 2021. And then just kind of thinking a little bit more
broadly, infrastructure spending around the world is picking up. We're seeing that a lot in Asia, and we do
think you'll see more of that globally. And then I'd say the Asia market is essentially -- I'm not going to
say it's fully pre-COVID levels. But it picked up in Q3, and we're seeing lots of activity there. And then the
Middle East, while a little bit different than kind of China and the rest of Asia, we do feel confident that the
Middle East projects do progress in 2021. And that would be more of the refining and the oil-related type
work there.

Andrew Alec Kaplowitz
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research

Very helpful. And then, Scott, you've done the -- see Flowserve 2.0 operate during the pandemic. And
while it seems like, as you mentioned, many of the work streams that you've outlined were going to
improve, they have improved. One could argue that the benefits are more difficult to see in work streams
such as aftermarket and growth. And you mentioned the positives of Flowserve 2.0 as it today includes
lean, design and value, but how much incremental impact could there be on the Flowserve business, you
can get all of the work streams on the right track in 2021 and beyond?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

We still think there's a big prize here, right? And so we announced at the beginning of the year that we
were kind of halfway done with these initiatives. We did accelerate a bunch of stuff on the cost and the
cost outside this year. But there's still opportunities. And we're in a full-scale transformation. And I'd say
where we see -- there's 2 areas that we see a lot of potential. And one is it's still on the manufacturing
side, the manufacturing productivity. And so there's a lot of work there to make our facilities more
effective. There's some roof line optimization that we still have to do. And so we'll continue to work on
that and become just a far better provider of products and short-cycle time and inventory management
and all the good stuff that comes with that. And then the other thing, we talked about it is that kind of
new product development organization, we call it marketing and technology.

We've been priming the pump now for 2 years. It was part of Flowserve 2.0, where we redid the new
product development process. We really put a lot of effort and focus in defining attractive markets.
Obviously, energy transition plays a big role in the backdrop of kind of where we're going to put our
money and where we're going to put our investments in products. And I'm really pleased with what we've
done this year. And so this is kind of the first time that you're seeing Flowserve come to the market with
new products and new introductions that we think are differentiated and that we think can drive growth
over the long run. And so as we gain confidence in that organization, we're going to continue to put more
money and put more resources there. And we truly do want to be a technology differentiated company.
And so you'll hear more and more from us around how we're doing that and where we think we can
differentiate in the future.

Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

So Scott, I know we touched on margins a little bit. And I guess, kind of hard to pin down here just given
where we are heading into 2021. But I guess, as I kind of think about the framework, you guys have done
a lot from a cost perspective to take cost out. Revenues are likely to be lower than, let's say, where you
kind of troughed in 2017 and I think margins troughed around like 8.7%. I think just given the cost outs, I
mean is it fair to assume that we expect margins are above the 2017 levels. I'm just trying to -- provide a
baseline for next year.

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I think really -- we'll provide that in the fourth quarter call where we get a lot more specific about
2021. Yes, the only thing I'd just say is that we continue to do all of the right things to manage this
business throughout the cycle, right? Whether it's a down cycle or up cycle, and I'm just -- I'm confident
in what we're doing with the Flowserve 2.0. And so we're going to continue to do that. And as a result, we
want to have -- as the business comes down, we want to have the best decrementals in the peer group.
We want to preserve our margins as best as possible. And at the same time, we want to be preparing
for growth in the upside. And so that's kind of the transition point we're at right now. Is that downturn
execution, we feel reasonably good on it, and we'll continue to do the right things to manage through
the downturn, but we've also got to be pivoting for growth and making sure that we are ready growing
the markets return. And so I'd just say, we are focused on the right things. And at the end of the fourth
quarter and the fourth quarter earnings call, we'll get real specific about 2021 and what we think we can
do.

Joseph Alfred Ritchie
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. No, that makes sense. And then I think one last question. Going back to some of your prepared
comments around like the percentage of the global energy mix today. I think you said 60% is oil and
expected to be 50% going forward. I guess just within that context, can you just kind of again, just
baselining, like what portion of your business today is tied to like traditional fossil fuels? And then given
some of these product introductions and where you're focusing kind of moving where the puck is going,
where do you think that mix can kind of shift to in the coming years?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes, so we decided a couple of public sources there. And basically, it's -- and these are all reasonably
recognized names and I'd say generally accepted. And so currently, kind of oil and gas makes up the
60%, we think it gets to about 50%. We highlighted 2040 as the number there. And then when you look
at our end markets, and we put a chart out there, gosh, I think it was either Q1 or Q2, right, when we
put it into the presentation. And it breaks down our end market outlook pretty specifically where we
get to downstream showing kind of 25% to 30%. And then the midstream at about 10% in oil and gas
on the upstream side being about 5%. And so that's our exposure there. And then just on the chemical
side, there is some petrochemical stuff there as well. But I'd just say, overall, with energy transition
as the backdrop, we know that, that mix starts to come down, right? It's inevitable. And my personal
view is COVID has accelerated this. And so everything that we're looking at is how can we participate in
infrastructure and process spending that involves flow, right?

So anything that's moving materials whether it's liquids or gas, we want to be a participant in that and
truly become a Flow Control solution provider. And so the new products that we talked about work in
lots of different applications. And so the CE liquid ring compressor, that works in carbon sequestration. It
works in hydrogen. It works in other gas applications. The anti-surge valve is really what that does is it

protects the compression stations. And so that works incredibly well in LNG and other gas applications.
And then the limiter to the IoT-enabled smart actuator, that can work in all kinds of different industries.
And so whether it's water or other infrastructure, that electric actuator is pretty ubiquitous across the
different end markets. And so when energy transition is the backdrop, we've got to focus on selective
markets that we think are attractive and have long-term growth potential. And it's been part of our
strategy now for 18 months, and you're starting to see the fruits of that labor in those discussions that
we're having with our leadership team.

Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

I Just wanted to follow-up on one of the cost comments that you made there, Scott. I mean it's $100
million of cost out this year. In my understanding, maybe when you reported second quarter earnings,
was that 2021 was going to be a wash between carryover structural savings and the return of some of the
temporary costs. The way you were talking here this morning, it sounds a little bit like it might be a net
tailwind now in your expectations into 2021. Is that from maybe volumes a little bit lower than you were
anticipating in 2021, so some of those temporary costs don't come back? Just any color you could give us
around that?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I don't -- yes, maybe tail was probably not the right word. But what I would say is we're confident in
the $100 million, half of it was structural. And as you annualize that, you get a little bit of an uplift here in
2021. I think the discretionary and some of those temporary measures will come back. I would say with
where we are with COVID. I don't think it comes back as aggressively as we might thought when we first
put those targets out. And then just the other thing I'd just add to this is -- I said this earlier, but we are
very focused on the cost structure. And anytime in a down environment, it's got to be the focus. We've got
to be tight on cost. There's more things that we need to do around cost structure, and our team is looking
at that, and we'll make sure that the cost structure is in line with the environment that we're in. Amy, do
you want to add anything else on that?

Amy B. Schwetz
Senior VP & CFO

No. I think that the key point is we're not done looking, and we continue to try and adjust our
expectations based on what we're seeing in the market. We know that the cost-out program that we put
in place delivered and is delivering what we expected to, and we want to ensure that we've got -- that we
keep that momentum going into 2021 and that we realize those structural savings and beyond.

Nathan Hardie Jones
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. Next one is on price. I think I asked you the same question, Scott, last quarter. Typically, in these
environments, you see very challenging pricing, particularly on large projects. And then you've got the
additional challenge of figuring out what you need to do with price versus filling factories to absorb
overhead and those kinds of things. It seems like the order rates are lower for longer than maybe we
thought 3 months ago, pricing's may be a little more challenging than you thought it was going to be 3
months ago. Just your current views on how you balance those 2 things of not filling the backlog full of
things that are very low-margin versus the need to absorb your fixed costs?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. No, you did ask this last quarter. And unfortunately, I'm going to answer it very similar to last quarter
as well. And I just said that the pricing pressure is real, and it really hasn't changed. And to your point,

FLOWSERVE CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 06, 2020

the longer this goes on, then they're more concerning it gets. What I will say is, I think our teams are
doing a really good job in terms of maximizing the pricing that's out there. But it is a difficult market. And
I'd say oil and gas is more challenging than some of the others because those customers are struggling
with their own financials. But there are places that our price has been pretty resilient. And so we're really
trying to be very selective on where we think we can get price and how do we maximize price. But to
your point, right, offsetting that with how do we think about absorption and what the benefits are there.
And then the other thing I'd just say is, on the cost side, and this might be a little bit different than last
quarter. We are starting to see relief in our supply chain. And so we're very committed to getting savings
through the supply chain we're seeing some of the commodities that are down in the materials that we
deal with. And so we're trying our best to offset pricing with the supply chain save things there.

And then I'd just say, again, there's other levels -- levers here on the cost side with design-to-value and
productivity and roof line optimization. And so we're going to continue to work through that. But it's
definitely a challenge in pricing right now.

Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

My first question is just on the QRC strategy. I guess, as part of the broader organizational realignment,
are those getting restructured out or lower as a part of the branch network? And just kind of thinking
about the next year, how does that trend in terms of the QRC and the expansiveness of it?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Sure. Yes. So the QRCs are definitely a differentiation for us. And I don't have the exact number where
we're at, but it's a large number around the world. And we constantly look at that. And so this year, we've
actually taken out a few of those, but it's not because -- it's just because we think there's opportunity
to rationalize and we can service from somewhere else. I would say our long-term strategy isn't net
reduction here. It's taking a few down where we can optimize the productivity of a network of QRCs and
then repopulating those in areas that make a lot of sense for us. And so I do think we -- I can't -- Jay
might know for sure. We -- I think we opened 1 up earlier this year in Asia Pacific. And then last year, I
know for sure, we had openings in the Middle East and Asia Pacific as well. But we're constantly looking at
this. And again, I wouldn't expect a net reduction overall.

However, there will be some consolidations this year. And then again, as we continue to grow and things
move forward, we'll continue to add to best support our customers. And for us, we want those QRCs in
proximity of big investments in installations. And so as projects move forward in advance in Asia Pacific
and the Middle East, we've got to continue to up our presence and be in proximity of those locations.

Brett Logan Linzey
Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Good to hear. And just somewhat related in terms of CapEx, you reduced it to I think $60 million was the
last update. What are you thinking for this year? And then as we roll into next year, I mean, should that
number move higher? Or is $60 million sort of a good place to be for a couple of years here?

Amy B. Schwetz
Senior VP & CFO

Yes. So we're -- we are anticipating we'll be around the $60 million mark this year. And although I
wouldn't call that a floor necessarily. I don't necessarily see us going lower than that number as we head
into 2021. We're really focused on building our enterprise system structure within Flowserve and obviously
focused on spending the money that we need to for safety and maintenance capital. So as we look at
2021, we're still working through the numbers, but I would anticipate we'll be at that level or modestly
higher.

Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Just a question. You sort of highlighted some supply chain issues. And as industry is evolving, I'm just sort
of thinking in terms of both global supply and your supply chain, do you think, a, the industry will change
where it will source from and become sort of maybe more localized, more price conscious? And do you
think you will adjust your own supply chain geographically shorten it or change it based on cost? And I
guess the bigger question is, how does the COVID pandemic impact your and industry thoughts about the
length and location of the supply chain?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes. So Andrew, I just -- let me go back to the original Flowserve 2.0 and what we found and what
we needed to do within our supply chain. And so when we started this, what we found was a highly
fragmented and responsive supply chain within Flowserve. And so a lot of our locations we're buying
very locally to our manufacturing location with relationships that they had for decades. And while that's
not necessarily bad, what we saw is that it doesn't allow us to leverage consolidated spend across our
enterprise. And so now over the last kind of 2.5 years, we've been on this journey to really get a more
sophisticated supply chain that we can leverage on an international scale. And so we've made pretty good
progress here. Similar with the overall transformation, we're probably maybe not even halfway done
with that effort at the beginning of this year. And so we're still on this path to get to preferred partners
that we've got agreements with, proactive spend. We've got quality requirements. We share ideas and
collaborate around lean, around safety and how we do things and truly have partnership at the critical
supply level. And so we've got a team highly focused on this, and we are making great progress.

Now when you throw the backdrop of COVID, and I'll just add the other twist is just kind of the geopolitical
range, what we always want to do is have a set of primary suppliers as well as backup. And I'd just say,
as we're kind of -- we are already in the process of doing things significantly different. The impact of
COVID and the impact of some of the geopolitical situation really hasn't changed our approach at all. And
we're just continuing to try to reduce that supply and then really start to work with these partnerships
with a handful of people. And for us, I'll just say, our big spend is castings is a big one for us. And so
we're working that one really hard. Motors on the pump side is really important to get that into a group of
selective suppliers. And then we've got some other miscellaneous categories that we're really looking to
formalize and make good progress here.

And so I think regardless of COVID, regardless of the geopolitical situation, I think our supply chain
improves dramatically in the next 2 years versus where we were as an organization over the last thank
you for such an extensive answer.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Thank you for such an extensive answer. And a follow-up question. As part of Flowserve 2.0, you guys sort
of were talking about doing stuff, I think, with PTC, digital remote monitoring. Can you give us examples?
Are you guys making headway with these initiatives in the COVID environment? Does it make customers
more open to sort of having more of this kind of technology. If any numbers you can put around that, that
would be great.

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Sure. The short answer is yes. We've made a lot of progress in kind of our IoT solution and what we
want to do in this kind of new world of monitoring and providing diagnostics and really just better
understanding the data that's out there and the data that we can collect and providing useful information

to not only ourselves, but to our operators to reduce our maintenance costs and to improve their
productivity. And so one of the things that I am excited about in this year is we have made great progress
on that. And so we had communicated some pilots and some things that we are testing and working with
some strategic partners, all of that continues to advance. And what I would say is we're not at the point
of kind of going full-scale yet in terms of our future offering and what we think we can do. But I would say
either in the Q4 earnings call or Q1, we're going to be prepared to talk about this in great detail.

But I would say we're there with certainly with our peer group and some of the others in terms of how
do we think about this and what that value could be. But -- and then my last point here is all of the
customers that we're talking to, and these are either refining, petrochemicals, specialty chem or other
infrastructure investments, everybody is starting to appreciate and understand the value of collecting data
and using that data. And so we think this is an exciting space. We think there's a pretty big opportunity for
Flowserve. And what we want to do is combine our knowledge of Flow Control. And so we've got a unique
position, where on the valve side, we've got isolation, where we've got the smarts and our limiter smart
electric actuator allows us to collect and transmit data that we weren't able to do before. And so you've
got that now in isolation with the actuation.

We've got it in control valves in terms of controlling flow. And then on the energy side with our pump
business, we're now collecting and enabling a lot more on the pump side. And so we think we're in a
unique position with isolation, control and energy to provide better solutions to our customers. And so I
don't want to go too far into this, and we are prepared to talk probably at the end of Q4 or Q1 in terms of
what our aspiration is, what we're doing and what we think that the potential value prize is for post.

Andrew Burris Obin
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

And all the COVID noise, it's hard to sort of focus on how big a deal this is going to be for you guys. So
look forward to the update. Thank you.

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Yes.

Operator

Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.

Joseph Craig Giordano
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division

You talked about the balance sheet, you highlighted it. Now with the -- with hopefully the worst of this
kind of at least working its way through your thought process and kind of kind of bottomed out. How do
you think about deploying that balance sheet? And you mentioned the energy transition, are you targeting
things in that area to kind of gain share there as things transition?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I'll start on kind of the inorganic and kind of way we're looking at investments. And then maybe
Amy can talk about some of the other firms on the balance sheet, like the debt maturities and things
like that. But we're -- Amy and the team have done a nice job to put us in an incredibly healthy position.
And so we feel good about the balance sheet. We feel like we got some firepower to start to deploy that
effectively for long-term value creation. And so we're going to talk before about a and programmatic offers
to attractive markets and looking at different things that can enhance and augment the portfolio closer. So
we are looking at dates. But unfortunately, it takes fires and sours to come to. And so sometimes we can
pull timing is, but I would say that we're actively looking at different things to add to the portfolio. Maybe
you want to add that something there.

Senior VP & CFO

Sure. So I'd just say that with this quarter's refinancing and tender, obviously, we do plan to deploy some
of that cash in the relative near-term to address maturities that we had coming in 2022 and 2023, 10. I
would say that Scott mentioned where we think about and how we think about M&A really through the
lens of financially attractive investments that we're confident that we can integrate successfully into our
business. And as we make decisions with respect to the deployment of capital. And our focus is always
around optimizing shareholder value and maintaining financial flexibility. So we'll continue to try and weigh
our options as we move into 2021 to ensure that that's we're doing.

Operator

And our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.

Michael Patrick Halloran
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

So just one from my end. When you think about where you are from a commercialization, R&D, new
product development perspective, maybe just talk about how far you are in that journey? And then
related, when you think about this energy transition that's ongoing and some of the new products you're
trying to bring forward to more fully participate in that. Is that something you think you can do internally?
Or is it going to require layering on targeted M&A from an environment to more fully participate?

Robert Scott Rowe
President, CEO & Director

Sure. I'll just -- I'll talk about new product development first, and then we'll talk about energy transition.
But again, I'm really pleased with what we're doing here. And we created a marketing and technology
organization about 3 years ago. And it's taken a little bit of time to, one, get the right focus, two, improve
the process and three, start to see things come out of the other side of it. But right now, I think we're
doing good things. And so we've got a great team of engineers and folks that truly understand our
markets, and it's a nice combination of a lot of experience understanding our end markets, combined
with a lot of innovative thinkers. But I just think there's a lot more to come here. And so this was always
something that was really important to me.

We -- the legacy of Flowserve is that we're a technology company, and we've got products that were first
in many different applications. And I really wanted to restore that luster and make sure that we can kind
of lean in on technology and product differentiation. And so I think we're kind of at the beginning -- we're
at the beginning of seeing the results of that, but we've done a lot of hard work to get in a position to
where we truly understand what we want to do and how we're going to do it. And so I feel really good
about that. And then just on kind of energy transition and where do we put our efforts, at Flowserve,
it's always going to be a combination. And so we want to have a robust portfolio within the new product
development organization, but we also want to be looking at the extra landscape, right? And to Amy's
point, it's -- we believe that there's a value creation opportunity inorganically, and we can do it faster and
we can make better returns than do it internally, then we're going to definitely look at that. And so there
will be some areas that we know we want to go externally just because in our industry, it's really hard to
overcome some of the customer references and getting on those approved AVLs. And so when we know
that we just can't make the pace that we want, then we're going to look to do something inorganically and
go outside. But I do think it will be a balanced approach, both in-house and looking at things externally.
But I feel good about what we have, right? And so we've got 200 years of legacy product experience.
We've got valves and pumps and pretty much any application that's out there. And it's really just about
channeling those resources, getting folks focused and committing the organization behind what we believe
is the long-term future and what we think are attractive markets.

Operator
