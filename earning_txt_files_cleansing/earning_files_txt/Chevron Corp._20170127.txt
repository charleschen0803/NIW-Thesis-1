Thank you, John
Turning now to Slide 5 which is an overview of our financial performance
The Company’s fourth quarter earnings were $415 million or $0.22 per diluted share while earnings for the full-year 2016 were a loss of $497 million
Excluding special items and foreign exchange, Chevron earned $1.8 billion in 2016. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation
Fourth quarter results were impacted by non-routine item and timing effects
Downstream results were weak reflecting adverse timing affect because of a rising crude price environment and an extensive turnaround at the Richmond refinery, a once in every five year event
At the same time, fourth quarter corporate charges which are known to be non-ratable were heavier than in average quarter
Our debt ratio at year was 24%
During the fourth quarter we paid $2 billion in dividends bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.29 per share
2016 was our 29th consecutive year of an annual per share increase
We currently yield 3.7%
Turning to Slide 6, cash generated from operations was $3.9 billion during the fourth quarter
Fourth quarter cash flow benefited from stronger oil prices but had offset the seasonal downstream margin patterns and the Richmond refinery turnaround
On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow totaled $12.8 billion, a function of low oil and gas prices and weaker downstream margins than in 2015. 2016 working capital consumption of approximately $600 and lower affiliate dividends relative to earnings reduced operating cash
We had deferred tax items of nearly $4 billion for example those associated with tax loss positions
These will benefit cash in future periods
Proceeds from assets sales for 2016 were $2.8 billion
Cash, capital expenditures were $4 billion for the quarter and about $18 billion for the full year excluding expense expiration
This continues a trend towards lower outlays
At year end our cash and cash equivalents totaled $7 billion
Our net debt stood at $39 billion resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 21%
Turning to Slide 7. Slide seven compares 2016 annual earnings to 2015. Full year 2016 results were a loss of $497 million or approximately $5 billion lower than the 2015 results
The impact of special items primarily due to lower gains on asset sales reduced earnings by $515 million
Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by about $710 million
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased $798 million between periods as lower realizations were only partly offset by lower operating costs and exploration expense
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange decreased by $2.8 billion, primarily due to lower margins
Recall that 2015 downstream margins were among the strongest we’ve seen in a number of years
The variance in the other segment primarily reflects higher cooperate charges and interest expense
Full year 2016 results are in line with our standing guidance of $350 million to $400 million in net charges per quarter for the other segment
Turning to Slide 8. I’ll now compare results for the fourth quarter of 2016 with the third quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter sales were approximately $870 million lower than the third quarter
The absence of third quarter 2016 gains from special items reduced earnings by $290 million between periods
Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $50 million between periods
Upstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased approximately $850 million between quarters, primarily reflecting crude utilization, higher volumes and lower taxes
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange were lower by $765 million
This outcome was primarily driven by decreased volumes and increased operating expense, associated with the Richmond refinery turnaround, lower worldwide margins and an unfavorable swing in inventory timing effect
The variance in the other segment is largely driven by adverse tax effects and corporate charges
These impacts are non-ratable and tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter
And now I'll turn it back to John
Yes
So I think it’s a good question
I wouldn’t say that there is anything necessarily that’s going to reverse
An example that you might not have thought of, when we have as many retirements as we have had for example, out of the U.S
John referenced, over the current year we have 5,200 pure employees this year and over the last couple of years it’s about 9,500. For example, if you look at the U.S
we're slightly under funded on our pension and now those retirements occurs and of course you need to accelerate the recognition of that pension settlement cost
So, that’s an example of what's sitting there in that corporate and other sector
And since we anticipate moderating, certainly we’re not going to have the same kind of employee reduction, that kind of thing will moderate going forward
There is a fair amount of lumpiness just on a tax sense, where we continually every quarter go through and make assessments of our outstanding positions and make the appropriate bookings that are required there and I can’t say that there is any pattern to that necessarily
As you look forward into 2017 though
I would say the one thing that probably is going to continue to grow would be our interest expense
Because our debt balances are higher
So we have had a guidance range of the $350 million to $400 million is probably towards the high end of that range probably you want to think in your mind around $400 million for each quarter for 2017.
I think it will be a cash contributor a partial cash contributor in 2017, yes
Because we have the ability in the U.S
to take some the tax losses and carry them back to earlier periods where we have taxable income
And depending upon what happens to prices and how we operate U.S
both upstream and downstream, we will get a schedule of repayments over time
