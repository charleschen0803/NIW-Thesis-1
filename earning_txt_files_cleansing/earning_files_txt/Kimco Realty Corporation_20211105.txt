Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to Kimco's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference. [Operator Instructions] Please
note, today's event is being recorded. I now would like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki,
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead, sir.

David F. Bujnicki
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Strategy

Good morning, and thank you for joining Kimco's third quarter earnings call. The Kimco management
team participating on the call today include Conor Flynn, Kimco's CEO; Ross Cooper, President and Chief
Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, our CFO; David Jamieson, Kimco's Chief Operating Officer; as well as
other members of our executive team that are also available to answer questions during the call.

As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward looking and it
is important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in
such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer
to the company's SEC filings that address such factors. During this presentation, management may
make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand
Kimco's operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the
Investor Relations area of our website.

Also in the event our call was to incur technical difficulties, we'll try to resolve as quickly as possible and if
the need arises, we'll post additional information to our IR website.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Today, I will share the highlights of the quarter, provide a
recap of our now closed strategic merger with Weingarten and give an update on the strong leasing
environment. Ross will give an update on the transaction market, and Glenn will cover our operating
metrics in detail, discuss our improved balance sheet, Albertsons valuation and the proactive use of our
ATM and how we can take advantage of opportunities in the market. He'll close with an updated outlook
for the balance of the year.

While we have only owned Weingarten for a partial quarter, our expanded portfolio of grocery-anchored
and mixed-use properties is already validating our investment thesis. To date, we are exceeding our initial
underwriting on all major metrics, including FFO, occupancy, spreads and renewal rates. As for synergies,
as outlined in our earnings release, we have achieved the upper end of both ranges and anticipate
achieving the full benefit of synergies by the end of 2022.

Our dedicated team has done a remarkable job closing on the merger ahead of schedule and
implementing an integration plan that included onboarding and training over 100 new employees,
significant systems integration and property management, all while staying focused on executing our
strategy. To all of my teammates, I just want to say thank you.

On the operational front, leasing demand continues to be robust across the portfolio, with the bright spot
being the rebound in demand for small shops. This was illustrated by the portfolio delivering another
quarter of improved results, including a sequential increase in occupancy and positive leasing spreads. Our
pro-rata U.S. occupancy is up 20 basis points to 94.1%, while anchor occupancy remained flat at 96.9%.
Small shop occupancy rose 180 basis points over prior quarter to 87.3%, an increase of 60 basis points
year-over-year.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

New lease spreads were a positive 5%, with 141 new leases signed, totaling 605,000 square feet. Spreads
for renewals and options finished at positive 4.9%. We closed the quarter with 270 renewals and options
totaling 1.4 million square feet, exceeding the 5-year average number of renewals and options reported
during the third quarter by 40% and exceeded average GLA renewed by 38%.

Combined spreads for third quarter 2021 were positive 4.9%, with total 3Q '21 deal volume reaching
411 deals totaling 2,050,321 square feet. 411 leases executed represents the most transactions reported
during a quarter since the first quarter of 2018.

Our same-site NOI growth was positive 12.1%, including a 30 basis point contribution from
redevelopments. The same-site population does not include the Weingarten sites since we only had them
for a partial quarter. With the continued strength in leasing, we have maintained our 300 basis point
spread of leased versus economic occupancy similar to last quarter.

As of September 30, 2021, we had over 400 signed leases representing $44.8 million of pro-rata
annualized base rents awaiting rent commencement. While the operating environment remains favorable,
we cannot let down our guard. Inflation, supply chain issues in the labor market, together or alone, can
impact our business, and that is why we continue to look for the most resilient assets, improve operational
efficiencies and seek out ways to help our tenants succeed.

We continue to grow our portfolio in the high-growth Sunbelt markets and are committed to being the
last-mile solution for tenants. There is no question that our mission-critical, last-mile brick-and-mortar
locations are proving to be durable solutions for consumers, retailers and many other businesses that want
scale and reach to serve the end customer.

In closing, we are pleased with the progress we have made and believe that we have positioned Kimco
for sustainable growth over the long term with a combination of internal and external growth levers. Our
talented and deep team is focused on execution as we're in a unique position to take advantage of a wide
range of opportunities. We continue to believe we're building something special, and the best is yet to
come. Ross?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Thanks, Conor, and good morning. It's been quite an exciting quarter at Kimco, and the excitement has
continued into the fourth quarter, as I will discuss shortly. There is no question that open-air shopping
centers provide one of the best risk-adjusted returns of all asset classes. We continue to see additional
capital sources, new and old, gaining conviction in quality open-air retail, leading to the compression of
cap rates. We are fortunate to be in a position with multiple investment strategies that enable us to be
active when opportunities arise, but also patient when things become too frothy.

With the finalization of the Weingarten merger, we've been able to execute on several accretive
investments and new initiatives and with the addition of new joint venture partners inherited through
Weingarten, we are excited about potential growth opportunities.

Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired the remaining 70% interest in a portfolio of 6 Publix-anchored
Sunbelt-region shopping centers from our existing joint venture partner, Jamestown, for a gross purchase
price of $425.8 million. The Publix-anchored assets represent over 1.2 million square feet of gross leasable
area in infill markets throughout the Southeast, with 5 located in the top-performing South Florida market
and 1 in the high-growth Atlanta market.

Subsequently, Kimco entered into a joint venture partnership with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust,
under which we will both own 50% and Kimco will continue to manage the portfolio. It is rare to have the
ability to buy a portfolio like this with short-term mark-to-market opportunities and exceptional tenant
sales. We are thrilled to be partnering with Blackstone again on our new strategic venture.

Also post quarter end and in line with our value creation strategy, we were successful in buying out our
partner's 85% interest in 2 grocery-anchored centers in California. Anaheim Plaza is one of the jewels of
our Southern California portfolio with extraordinary highway visibility in frontage and 2 grocery anchors

at the same property, both performing exceptionally well. The second asset is Brookvale Shopping Center
located in Fremont, California anchored by a Lucky's supermarket and CVS. The gross purchase price of
the 2 assets was $134 million.

Turning to our redevelopment program. It continues to move ahead, beginning with property-level
entitlements and then selectively and creatively activating a few at a time. While the structure and exit
strategy are determined on a case-by-case basis, we see the upside knowing these infill locations are
being built at a significant relative spread to the stabilized cap rate. Comps in multifamily, industrial and
other asset classes are regularly transacting with cap rates starting in the 2s and 3s.

Additionally, we're continuing our structured investment program with a disciplined approach and an
emphasis placed on location, demographics, quality of tenancy and operational strength of the sponsors.
We view the base case of these investments as a true win-win, either generating an attractive return with
a repayment down the road or exercising our right of first refusal and owning the properties outright.

On that front, we completed a $21.5 million mezzanine financing on a strong performing center in San
Antonio called Alamo Ranch. In just a few short months, San Antonio has gone from a market that was
on our target list at Kimco to a major contributor in our portfolio with the Weingarten merger and now our
second structured investment there. We continue to pursue additional opportunities in San Antonio, one of
the fastest-growing MSAs in the country.

We also sold 3 small low-growth assets this quarter, two single tenant boxes and an undeveloped parcel
for a total of $23.5 million at a flat 5% cap. While dispositions will remain a relatively small component
of our investment strategy, we will be prudent in disposing of low-growth assets and undeveloped parcels
from which we can redeploy the capital.

To repeat Conor's statement, we are confident that the best is yet to come. Off to Glenn for the financials.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Thanks, Ross, and good morning. We are pleased to report very strong third quarter results. Overall, the
portfolio continues to produce improving results, including record quarterly revenue, increased occupancy,
positive leasing spreads, strong same-site NOI growth, increased collections and lower credit loss.

Our balance sheet metrics are also at the strongest levels ever. As you might expect, the completion of
the $5.9 billion Weingarten merger, which closed in early August, was a key contributor. While we did not
have a full quarter of contribution from the addition of the Weingarten portfolio, the benefits are clearly
apparent. Our team has put in enormous effort to accomplish the successful integration of Weingarten in a
very short period of time, many thanks to our highly motivated and skilled team. We couldn't be prouder.

Now for some details on our third quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $173.7 million or $0.32 per diluted
share and includes $47 million or $0.08 per diluted share of merger-related expenses. This compares to
the third quarter 2020 NAREIT FFO of $106.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share, which includes aggregate
charges of $16.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to severance for our voluntary early retirement
program and early redemption of $485 million of unsecured bonds.

The increase in FFO was primarily driven by higher NOI of $98.7 million, of which the Weingarten merger
contributed $62.6 million. In addition, NOI benefited from lower credit loss of $30.7 million and higher
straight-line rent of $14.5 million, including $2 million from the Weingarten portfolio. Improvements in
collections and new leases commencing during the quarter were the major contributors. Specifically,
during the third quarter, we collected approximately 98% of base rents.

We also collected 80% of rents due from cash basis tenants, up from 77% last quarter. Furthermore,
collections of prior period amounts from cash basis tenants totaled $8 million during the third quarter
of 2021. Our cash basis tenants comprise 9.1% of pro-rata annualized base rents. If we excluded the
addition of the Weingarten cash basis tenants, this amount would have been 7.3%, which compares
favorably to the 8.8% level reported last quarter.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

In connection with the preliminary purchase price allocation for the Weingarten transaction, the debt we
assumed was recorded at a fair value, which was $107 million higher than the face amount. This resulted
in $6.2 million of fair market value amortization for the third quarter, which reduces interest expense and
is also part of the FFO improvement. We expect to finalize our purchase price allocation by year-end.

During the third quarter, FFO also included approximately $6 million or $0.01 per diluted share related to
onetime contributions from several joint ventures and higher lease termination fees.

Turning to the balance sheet. We had an active quarter in the capital markets. We issued a new $500
million unsecured bond at a coupon of 2.25%, the lowest coupon for 10-year unsecured financing in the
company's history. Proceeds from this issuance were primarily used to fund the cash component of the
merger consideration and the merger costs.

We also opportunistically used our ATM equity program to issue 3.5 million shares of common stock,
raising almost $77 million in net proceeds to fund some of the investment activity Ross just mentioned.
This is in addition to the 179.9 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the Weingarten
merger valued at $3.7 billion. We also assumed $1.8 billion of debt, including the fair value adjustment as
part of the Weingarten merger.

Total common shares outstanding at quarter end was 616.4 million, and we expect this should be a good
guide for the fourth quarter. As anticipated, the Weingarten merger was a deleveraging event. As of
September 30, net debt to EBITDA on a look-through basis, including pro-rata share of joint venture
debt and preferred stock outstanding was 7x. This metric only includes 2 months of EBITDA from the
Weingarten merger, but all of the debt assumed. On a pro forma basis, including a full quarter of EBITDA
from Weingarten, look-through net debt-to-EBITDA would be 6.3x, representing the lowest level since we
began tracking this metric.

Our liquidity position also remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with over $450 million of cash
and full availability on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, during the third quarter, the value
of our Albertsons marketable security investment climbed to more than $1.2 billion after increasing by
$457 million, which is included in net income but not FFO for the quarter. We continue to evaluate our
opportunities to begin the Albertsons' monetization process.

As we look ahead, during 2022, we will have a variety of potential uses for the capital from the
redemption of our preferred stock issuances that become callable, bonds that mature in October and
November of 2022 and accretive investment opportunities.

As our overall business continues to recover from the effects of the pandemic and as we begin to benefit
from the successful merger and integration of the Weingarten portfolio, we are raising our full year 2021
NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.36 to $1.37, which includes $0.10 per diluted share of
merger-related costs and the inclusion of the Weingarten portfolio for 5 months.

This compares to previous NAREIT FFO per share guidance of $1.29 to $1.33, which did not include any
impact from the Weingarten merger except $0.01 related to merger costs. As I touched upon, our third
quarter FFO includes a total of $0.03 per share related to items that were more onetime in nature and
which were not budgeted for as recurring items. This includes $0.02 per diluted share from improvements
in credit loss and another $0.01 from contributions from joint ventures and lease termination fees. We will
provide initial 2022 guidance on our next earnings call.

And with that, we're happy to now take your questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

First of all, congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to start off with leasing spreads. Maybe get some insights
from you guys if this is what a normalized market feels like. I typically look at leasing spreads as a
leading indicator for same-store revenue and same-store NOI. So I'm curious, does this feel like a normal
environment to you post-COVID?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. Thanks, Rich. Good question. So the leasing spreads, I mentioned each quarter, it's really dependent
on the population that is rolling and get executed quarter-over-quarter. So you do see volatility in that
number. Some quarters, you could have significantly below market leases that roll and you execute and
obviously, you'll get a real net benefit out of that. This quarter, we had an outsized amount of small-
shop volume that came through, which is typically closer to market. So that's where you see that sub-5
range for this quarter, but it's not indicative necessarily what could happen next quarter if you have some
outsized anchor activity that has a significant below market value that then you then can recapture.

So when you look at what we've been doing over the last trailing to 8 quarters and maintaining that
positive spread, there is some volatility in that number, and it's really just indicative of what's rolling.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Rich, we are seeing some pretty significant pricing power on escalating rents in the Sunbelt. I think that's
where you're going to see the spreads continue to be quite strong as we're seeing really the market rent
growth there outpaced the rest of the country.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes, that's helpful. And the reason I'm just focusing on it is I go back to your 2025 guide. And if you can
put up these leasing spreads, that might mean that's a conservative guide, but well taken. Conor, maybe
this is for you. I noted that Albertsons is worth $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Have you given any
thought to monetization, how you would use that in capital allocations? Any thoughts there?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. As we noted in the remarks, we have a lot of optionality. I think that's the beauty of where we sit
today, Rich. If you look at the business and where we sit, we've got obviously a lot of leasing momentum.
Clearly, we're going to allocate a lot of capital to that. That's our first priority as that really fuels
the earnings growth. Then we have redevelopment opportunity as well. You've seen the entitlement
work we've done throughout the portfolio. And the nice part is we're seeing a lot of external growth
opportunities as well as Ross outlined.

We do have some debt reduction opportunities, as Glenn outlined in his script. So yes, we're going to look
at the menu and see what's really the most accretive towards our FFO growth because that's really where
we're focused, and we have a lot of different levers to pull. So it's a nice, obviously, bucket of capital
to redeploy. It's not earning a tremendous amount right now. So we're going to be prudent with it and
recognize that we have a great menu to select from.

Operator

And the next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So 2 questions. First, just going to the -- I don't know if you guys are going to return to the Kimstone
name. But the sub-5 cap rate that you guys bought at, one, just a little bit more beyond what is
underlying that sub-5. And then two, just bigger picture, not surprised to see cap rates compressing,
but how do you guys -- how is your underwriting of acquisitions, whether portfolio or individual assets,
changed? Because obviously, the price that you paid for Weingarten can't be replicated today. So just sort
of curious how your underwriting deal is today given where pricing is going?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes, sure, happy to address that, Alex. So as it relates to the venture with Blackstone, I mean, these are
clearly fixed assets that we felt very strongly about. Between the location, Publix being one of the best
grocery anchors that you could possibly have with exceptional sales. As I mentioned in the script, having
near-term mark-to-market opportunities in Publix-anchored centers is somewhat rare. So when you look
at the vintage of those assets, it gives us an opportunity to create some additional growth probably sooner
than some other opportunities that we have in the portfolio with Publix.

So we're really excited about that. We're really excited about sort of reengaging our venture with
Blackstone after a very successful one several years ago. Underwriting is still a very specific exercise.
We look at every single asset, every single space taking into consideration the growth in the market,
the demographics, where the population growth is coming from and just making sure that we have very
strong conviction in our ability to push rents.

We're not looking to invest in assets that don't have outsized growth. So the ones that you do see us
pulling the trigger on, you can -- rest assured that we believe very strongly that we're going to be able
to push that outsized growth beyond the average of our portfolio. So I don't think that there's anything
specifically changing in terms of our underwriting strategy, whether it's a single asset or a portfolio. It's
really just making sure that we look at every single asset, every single space and feel pretty good that
there's below-market leases that we can push over time.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So as far as the Blackstone, the sub-5, what would you say that that cap rate will get to in a few years out
when you would have an ability to roll rents?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. I mean it's hard to predict. We have opportunities to discuss things sooner than later, hopefully, with
the grocery anchor. So the timing is going to depend on where those negotiations go. But like I said, we're
very confident that the growth there is going to outpace the average of our portfolio, hopefully by a wide
margin.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then the second is, as far as retailer demand for space, are you sensing -- not that retailers
ever want to pay more in rent, but are you sensing that that rent conversation is easier today. So when
you're saying, hey, look, we have multiple tenants for certain space, you guys have to pay more. Now the
tenants are more willing to engage in those conversations where as maybe a few years ago, they were
more willing to push back. Do you sense a change there in the leasing dynamic on the rent discussion?

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes, great question. The dynamic is always evolving. And I think where we are today is there's so much
pent-up demand on the open-to-buy side for retailers. So you have some retailers that have really
expanded the breadth of their offering in multiple brands that they're looking to expand. TJX being a great
example and they actually increased their open-to-buy targets. So that just makes them more competitive
for space. They want space they need to grow.

I think COVID -- the silver lining through COVID is that brick-and-mortar is essential for any omnichannel
strategy. Retailers have really come to appreciate that customers have appreciated that. It's a great form
of distribution. The margins are better there. And then thirdly, obviously, there is no new development
supply coming online. It's really COVID inventory that's getting absorbed. So to that third point, I think,
generally speaking, as more of that gets absorbed, you're able to push rents further north.

That said, to Conor's point earlier, we are seeing rent progressions in the Sunbelt and coastal markets.
Southern California, for example, is becoming extremely competitive, where we are seeing some nice
traction pushing that rent forward even beyond where we were pre-pandemic levels. But I'd say, generally
speaking, you're in a very healthy environment from a landlord perspective as a result of all those
variables.

Operator

And the next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

So thinking about the synergies, which I guess I was pleasantly surprised to see you guys' expectation
at the top end of those synergies. But given the fairly quick achievement of those goals, is there any
potential for additional cost savings through 2022, perhaps?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

There are, yes. So we're really proud of the team and how we're able to integrate both companies. So
quickly, the majority of those initial synergies were really related to staffing and G&A, which is something
that you could anticipate and plan for a premerger. What we're really seeing now is an opportunity once
we've merged these companies and really looked at professional services, information technology and the
longer-term contracts that Weingarten has had where we can now merge them and/or dissolve some in
time, will create some additional synergies that will help us push that number further northward.

So from the outset, we felt very good. We invested a tremendous amount of time upfront with the
integration management office, kicking off 60 days prior to the merger. So we really did a deep dive on
how the combined company will look and operate, which enabled us, obviously, to achieve the numbers we
did today and feel very good about what's going to happen in '22.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Maybe the only thing I would add is Kimco is laser-focused on efficiency. We always have been built in and
has ingrained that in our DNA. So yes, we're happy with the integration and where it sits today, but we're
a combined entity going forward. And so we'll make sure that same focus continues going forward.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. And going back to the shop leasing real quick. Is there anything you can tell us in terms of the
trends you're seeing in that space? How much of that demand may have been pent-up demand? Which

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

tenant categories are generating kind of the most inquiries and demand for space? Any color there would
be appreciated.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Sure. Yes. I mean there's demand across almost all the categories right now. Grocery is the obvious one.
They're the clear beneficiary of the pandemic. They now have a surplus of cash that they're looking to
reinvest in their 4 walls, expand their open-to-buy, grab market share and really invest towards the future,
so how do they create better connectivity with the customers. So that's going to be really important for
them as well as all the sectors.

Off-price, as I mentioned earlier, with TJ, about Ross, Burlington, and others, Old Navy, they're all actively
expanding their footprint. Again, they see -- I think all retailers see this opportunity where it's a short
window to upgrade the quality of their portfolio, maybe penetrate a market or expand their market share
in certain areas that pre-pandemic there was no inventory available. And so you do have this COVID
inventory that's creating this unique opportunity for them.

But what I found that was actually interesting, this last quarter, when we go back to our small shop
activity is that 35% of our new deal activity was related to restaurants and the fast casual side on the
small shop side. So it's nice to see that the fast casual QSRs are coming back, the Crumbl Cookies of the
world, et cetera. So you're starting to see that expand out. And I think as COVID starts -- the COVID
anxiety starts to subside, people want to go back and reengage. They want to socialize or are social
creatures, that's creating that opportunity on the foodservice side.

Fitness, the value-oriented fitness, Planet Fitness. I mentioned early on, several quarters ago that Planet
and Crunch have been very proactive in wanting to expand their footprint and recapture. But you're also
seeing that now extend out into the boutique fitness category. So that's again attracting the small shops.
So you're really seeing it from a variety of areas. And then people are playing with formats. We have Bob's
Discount who's experimenting with a smaller format right now.

So it's giving them optionality appreciating that they may be able to provide different service offerings to
different customers in different areas. And so it's important that they have a [ palette ] to play from.

Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

And this all seems like sustainable demand in your view? Like if you look at the forward pipeline, still just
as strong as it has been?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

I do. I mean I think it goes back to the validation of open air and the validation that brick-and-mortar is
an essential part of any retailer's strategy. And we've obviously gone through a very volatile evolution
over the last 6 years about people's views and opinions and how the markets responded to different ideas
related to e-commerce and whether or not what's essential. But let's go all the way back to core basics.
People like to engage, they like to touch and feel product. Retailers need multiple forms of distribution to
reach that customer. And so brick-and-mortar, we see it very much as being essential to them.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. We're more convinced than ever that last mile retail is where we want to be and where we want to
continue to focus our strategy. If you look back 5 years ago, that's exactly where we were focused. And so
we feel like we're in a really good spot to benefit from that increased demand.

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

My question is on the leased occupancy to economic occupancy spread. I think given that there
is a myriad of supply chain and labor issues and maybe a slowdown from lease signing to rent
commencement, like how should this metric kind of progress from here, given that the time to go from
lease signing to rent commencement is expanding and at the same time, leasing has been so strong? How
do those dynamics impact the you -- impact the progression from here?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Sure. Yes. In short, the question is whether or not lease economic will expand or contract as we look out
into the future. And I think what we could see is 300 basis points is more or less at our high water mark
on a historic basis. And you could see some additional expansion as we approach the first part of '22.
But as these tenants start to come online and open, you are going to start to see that compression set in
through the back half of '22 and into '23.

And then I believe our normalized rate was about 170 basis points on spread. I don't think you see that
for a period of time, but you are right. To your points about supply and openings, it's something that
we watch very, very closely. We work hand-in-hand with our tenants. We have a very substantial tenant
coordination program. which really is designed to shepherd tenants through the permitting and build-
out process, those that don't have the resources available to them to address all of these issues that are
coming out to the market. Obviously, that's been really helpful.

In addition to that, we're trying to get well ahead on preordering of supplies and materials when we
can, when it makes sense. We all lived through the backlog. It doesn't matter who you are and no one's
immune to it. So we're just eyes wide open about that process, and we'll manage it as best we can and
apply the resources that we need to do to get it done.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. I would just add that the one big benefit that Kimco has is our scale and our efficiencies of scale. So
we're not buying small amounts of HVAC units or roofing materials or anything that's needed for a fit-
out for a specific tenant. We usually buy in bulk and we usually get premier pricing as well as relationship
pricing. So we feel like we have the ability to -- as Dave mentioned, to utilize our network and to utilize
our efficiencies as best we can to try and mitigate the supply chain issues.

Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division

And scale is a good segue into my next question. Now that you've had Weingarten tucked into the
business for about 3 months, how can -- how has your scale changed your conversations with national
tenants? Is there a willingness to partner? And these tenants to kind of go further with you because of
your scale and you're able to offer more opportunities for leasing than maybe smaller landlords? I'm
trying to understand the revenue synergy -- I'm trying to understand like if there are revenue synergies
associated with the transaction.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Sure. Well, on the retailer side, even prior to the transaction, we're typically the largest landlord for a lot
of these retail partners. So that's just compounded as a result of the merger. That conversation obviously
always has its benefits, right? It can pull both ways depending on what's being discussed. But in general,
it does afford us the opportunity to be out in front of those retail partners.

They have a very aggressive open-to-buy strategy. We now have over 560 sites that we can show them
to help accommodate and fill that void. So obviously, you can do that at scale, that's a good thing for both

parties, but also helps us progress the conversation beyond that. Retailers are trying to figure out and
innovate and change to become and stay more relevant to the customer.

We want to work with them to be part of that solution and understand from a landlord perspective what do
we need to do. So it creates a very, very constructive dialogue to help drive our business forward and to
your point, revenue and top line growth.

And the next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

So the recent JV, the transaction with Blackstone, I found very interesting. A case study of capitalizing
on the market moving cap rates. And then you bought 2 JV assets out in California, further kind of
spotlighting the embedded acquisition opportunity. So I guess my question is, what's your interest level
in pursuing further deals like this? And can you discuss the funding sources that would involve Albertsons
stock at all?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Sure. I'm happy to address that. So for us, I mean, we really view it as a significant level of optionality.
And we've said, even as we've been sort of skinnying down our joint venture exposure over the last 7 or
8 years, on the Kimco side, we've had 3 very strong long-term partners that we continue to do business
with. And as we've said from the start that we like having the ability to potentially grow opportunistically,
if there is a reason to bring in a new partner like we felt here on this particular transaction.

But for those that are potentially looking for a monetization event, we are willing and able -- to be able to
have that discussion with them hopefully in a negotiated basis, if not having that right of first refusal to be
ready to take advantage of that if the partner is looking to exit. So one of the nice benefits that we see in
the Weingarten merger is after getting down to really just 3 major partners on the Kimco side there are
now about 14 new joint venture partners from that transaction, some of which are looking to do long-term
business with Kimco and we welcome that. Others that are potentially looking to take some chips off the
table or monetize their retail investments and we're also prepared to have those discussions as well. And
we are having those conversations as we speak.

So for us, given all the levers that we have, Conor mentioned and Glenn both mentioned in their prepared
remarks, between the significant amount of cash, availability on our credit facility, ultimately, Albertsons
monetization opportunity, we'll just be very prudent and selective with where we want to utilize that
capital, but having a lot of different ways to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves.

Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division

Great. Appreciate the thoughts. One follow-up on the signed but not leased ABR. I think you mentioned
$44.8 million. How much of that should we expect to hit in 2022?

Ross Cooper

Right now, we're tracking around $25 million to about $30 million potentially that could flow in '22. And
that would be obviously back loaded.

And the next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division

I guess I just -- I want to talk bigger about the current operating environment, which seems to have real
strength from the consumer and just the aggressive leasing from retailers. This looks like an environment
that's much better than 2019 when you go back to look at people's earnings results. So beyond revenge
spending and then retailers looking to take advantage of opportunities, what's beneath this impressive
growth that's happening in the operating environment?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. I think, again, on the retailer demand, it's a lot of the points that I mentioned earlier, Craig, but it's
appreciating that the value of brick-and-mortar is real. Operators see it in their margins, consumers see
the convenience and the efficiencies, the last-mile distribution. It goes into this very complex network of
how to distribute goods from the retailer to the customer.

And so I think COVID, the irony of COVID was it sort of validated that open air was really essential. It's
closest to the customer. I think you also now have this hybrid work environment. It's -- we don't really
know what that will look like long term. But I think the one thing that's clear is going to be a little bit
different for everyone. And as a result of that, you are having people that are staying more in that first-
ring suburban markets that are maybe starting to appreciate the value proposition there, too, which also
then creates that opportunity to engage in open air out in the first-ring suburbs where the majority of all
of our portfolio resides.

So we're seeing that benefit as well. And that could probably carry longer term into the market. So I think
you're just starting to see all these pieces that were in flux and in development over multiple years sort of
come to a head and now creating this environment that we're in today.

So going forward, I think you continue to see the open to buys be aggressive as we start to absorb that
COVID inventory. And then from there, I think the consumer is in a very strong position right now to take
advantage of that.

Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division

Great. And then just on your net debt to EBITDA, I guess, it's at 7 or pro forma 6.3. Glenn, what's your
long-term target for net debt to EBITDA?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. Well, I mean, again, we want to try and keep it in that 6 to 6.5x range on a total look-through basis.
So we're -- on a pro forma basis, we're right in that sweet spot right now. And again, we continue to focus
on just bringing leverage down over time. I think as you continue to see EBITDA grow, again, we're being
very cautious about how much debt comes on. We've been doing a lot to reduce debt levels, absolute debt
levels over time. Again, the Weingarten merger added $1.8 billion in total, $1.7 billion on a face value,
$1.8 billion with the fair market value adjustment.

But again, on an absolute basis, you'll continue to see us reduce debt, and we continue to try and reduce
as much secured debt as we can as well. So we did assume about $300 million of mortgages. But over
time, we'll just continue to pay those off with unsecured debt or cash flows from the company.

And the next question comes from Katy McConnell with Citi.

Mary Kathleen McConnell
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

So now that you have another quarter of leasing underway, can you update us on your expectations for
mark-to-market upside within the near-term expirations within your portfolio, especially on the anchor
side and now what you're expecting from upcoming Weingarten leases?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

Yes. Sure, Katy. We're in the process of going through our '22 budgets now. So when you look at our '22
rollover schedule for anchors, it is below market, it's below our average anchor base rents as well. So we
do see nice mark-to-market opportunities as we either start to renew those leases, of which we're well
underway there and/or sign new leases. So we do see a net benefit as we go into '22, but we're in the
process of finalizing our budgets right now, and we'll have a better perspective in the next call.

Mary Kathleen McConnell
Citigroup Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then on the retailer side, how do you expect these supply chain disruptions and labor shortages
to play out to your tenants around the holidays this year? And are you concerned about any potential rent
collection fall out or impact to new leasing momentum?

David Jamieson
Executive VP & COO

On the rent collection side, we don't have a material concern there. I think on the supply chain, every
retailer has tried to address it differently. Some have been actively and aggressively focused on and trying
to figure out ways and alternatives to redirect their supply chain through the course of this entire year,
appreciating that this may be an issue.

Some have brought inventory levels up in -- back onto the Mainland to their preparation for the holiday
season. But -- it's clear that there is -- there are pressures there. I'd suggest we all buy early. We don't
want to disappoint any of our loved ones during the holiday season. And what that means too, that
means, as a result, that retailers can probably have fewer promotions. So there's a smaller promotional
window, which helps drive top line revenues, which is a net benefit to them.

So it's a really interesting dynamic that's all playing out. On the labor shortage side, obviously, there are a
number of job openings now. It's a very robust job market. The job for just -- those are I think 500...

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

4.6.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. I mean, it's -- so that's very encouraging. But yes, there is clearly a need for more workers at the
retailers and at the restaurants. And I think that will continue to play out through the first part of '22.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Katy, the only thing I would add is our traffic levels are at 105% of 2019 levels. And we see that in this
environment, where there is supply chain disruption, we're watching closely as what we think may occur
as people will probably buy at the store more often than buying something online and potentially having to

And the next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.

Caitlin Burrows
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Given that you issued $77 million of equity in the quarter and your share price is now at the highest of
2019, can you just go through the thinking on issuing equity in the quarter and going forward? And does it
suggest you could equity fund the acquisitions going forward?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Sure. Again, we issued some -- we used the ATM a little bit during the quarter. Again, it was really to
match up against some of the investment opportunities that we had. And again, just a continued focus on
the balance of our capital structure to further improve our leverage metrics. So we are always looking at
our cost of capital and we're looking at the opportunities that we have ahead of us. So it was a modest
supplement of equity during the quarter to match up really some very accretive investments that we have.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

We're in a very fortunate position to have a number of different pools of capital sources. So we're trying
to make sure that we look at everything and again, our cost of capital and use it effectively to continue to
grow in an accretive manner.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. I mean we are -- as I mentioned, we ended the quarter with over -- we have about $480 million on
the balance sheet. We've had some obviously activity that Ross mentioned, subsequent to quarter end.
So we're still sitting with $330 million of cash, no real near-term debt maturities and full access to our
revolver. In addition, we have the Albertsons investment. So we're in very, very strong liquidity position to
deal with things that are upcoming.

Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

So just going back to the demand question, obviously, things are great. I'm just curious about where
you're seeing the hottest pockets of demand and conversely, where it's a little bit weaker. And I know
you mentioned Sunbelt versus [ north ], but maybe you can go a little bit deeper. Does it matter? Like
what type of center, power center or grocery anchored? Is it just location demographic space, where
you're seeing more customers or more population growth? I'm just trying to understand just a little more
granularity on where the demand is. I don't mean today, I mean over the next couple of years.

16

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. I mean I think the next couple of years could be somewhat reflective of today as well. So just
thinking of geographics first because you mentioned that, the Sunbelt, out of the 141 leases that we
signed this quarter, over 52% came from Sunbelt markets. And then within that, the substantial majority
were actually coastal some belt. So I think you will continue to see that trend progress over the next
couple of years. That is where population growth is continuing to rise greater than the rest of the country.

Second to that, though, on the coastal market, for that remaining, say, 48% of leases signed, it was
heavily weighted towards the coastal markets. So I think you still see that high demand there. So between
that, the coastal and Sunbelt, that's where we have seen the majority of activity. Beyond that, too, like
Southern California, as I mentioned earlier, is extremely aggressive. It's a very, very tight market to
penetrate. So this COVID inventory created opportunities, multiple demand factors that helped push rents
further north.

In the Northeast, it's typically been a fairly mature portfolio, usually having higher occupancy levels. And
so it's just there are natural constraints there to actually add any new supply as well. And people wanting
to penetrate Long Island, for example, I think will continue to be difficult. So when there is an opportunity,
you do see multiple bidders at the table wanting to enter the market. And then -- so I think that's what
you continue to see play out over the next couple of years.

Ki Bin Kim
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

And thinking about the Weingarten portfolio, how has that performed relative to your own portfolio?
And I guess, looking forward, how much more accretive can Weingarten's contribution be to the overall
enterprise?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. So when we actually put -- when we first went under contract on the transaction, their occupancy
levels were less than ours. But by the time we actually closed, it was very, very close to where we were.
So we're getting that net benefit now of those signed leases that have yet to flow. And so we always had
the original thesis that it was a very complementary portfolio, be additive in nature.

I think when you look at the small shop gains that we had a 180 basis points, 120 of which came from the
Weingarten portfolio, 60 of which came from Kimco gains, which was one of our high water marks as well
quarter-over-quarter. So you're seeing a real benefit there from Weingarten and then obviously combined
as the entity, we're both growing together now.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. The other part of it is the 3 mixed-use projects that they have there now, the concessions are rolling
off, so the mark-to-market on those renewals is pretty far strong on those 3 projects. And then when we
look at the future entitlement opportunities within that portfolio, it gets us really excited because that's
obviously where we've been focusing a lot of our time and effort for future value creation. And we feel
like there's going to be some incremental opportunities embedded throughout their portfolio, specifically
Miami, Houston and Silicon Valley that we're digging our teeth into right now.

I guess when looking at the balance sheet, it looks like you're in a good spot right now, especially with the
Albertsons look-through. So I'm just wondering why you elected to do a joint venture on the Jamestown
portfolio when there's so much upside in the assets?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. I mean it's a good question. We thought long and hard about the best approach here. We have a
tremendous amount of respect for Blackstone. We've continued conversations with them since the success
of our early venture. And ultimately, we felt that it was a perfect opportunity for us to reengage the
venture that we had with them. We think that there could be some future opportunities here, and this
could be the beginning.

There's no guarantees one way or the other. But we thought this was a great jumping point given all the
activity that we have in the market, all the things that we see to engage that venture and see where it
takes us. So that's really what the conversation was, and we're excited about it.

Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Got it. And then when we look at Albertsons, how should we think about the monetization of that asset
maybe on, I guess, a max dollar per year if you wanted to maximize your retained cash flow and not pay
out special dividends?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes, it's a great question. I think there's a few components that we have to look at when it comes to
Albertsons because of the significant increase in its value. Keep in mind, our basis is incredibly low, right?
Our basis today is still a little over $100 million. So the real governing factor for us is REIT compliance.
So if you think about the REIT rules, 75% of your gross revenues have to come from real estate-related
items.

So that leaves about -- you have a 5% bad income bucket and then you have the other 20% that could
be interest and dividends and capital gains. So the governor is going to be how much our gross revenues
are. And our gross revenues today on a look-forward basis with the merger are somewhere around $1.8
billion. So monetization-wise, about somewhere around $350 million to $400 million a year of gain is what
we could absorb today. The larger the gross revenue number is the more we can do. But I would say today
that we're looking at somewhere around $400 million on an annual basis is what we can do.

Tamara Jane Fique
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just maybe, Ross, thinking about -- you said earlier, I guess that you would think about selling some
assets going forward. But given your strong capital position, I guess I'm wondering what we can expect
in terms of that sales activity in 2022. And if that will be driven by geography? Or will it be more one-off
based upon asset growth profile?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes. I think we believe that our dispositions program will continue to be just a pruning of select assets
for a variety of reasons. I did mention how there are several joint venture partners that we have that
might be looking to exit. So we have conversations with them every day. Many of the assets of which
we're talking to them about potentially buying out their position, depending on where that pricing is or

KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  NOV 05, 2021

the quality of those assets, some of them differ, we may be market sellers if we think the pricing is too
aggressive or the asset just doesn't necessarily fit the growth profile for the portfolio.

So you may see a little bit more activity from the joint venture portfolio, both on buyouts and some
potential select dispositions. Otherwise, part of what we inherited with the Weingarten portfolio as well as
from the previous Kimco portfolio, is some undeveloped land parcels that we're constantly evaluating as to
whether we believe they're prudent to be developed over time or if we're better off recycling that capital
selling from nonincome-producing assets and then taking that capital for higher growth opportunities.

So that's really where you're going to see the bulk of the disposition activity. But again, we don't think it's
going to be a tremendous component of our capital stack.

Tamara Jane Fique
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Great. And then maybe one for Glenn. It looks like FFO per share is $0.99 year-to-date. I guess
with the guidance raise, it implies $0.37 to $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter. Is there anything in that
fourth quarter implied FFO that is nonrecurring? Or is that a pretty good run rate as we think about 2022?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Well, again, the $0.37, $0.38 level, again, that is a recurring rate. Again, as I mentioned, the third
quarter did have some, call them, onetime in nature items. You had some real benefit coming from the
improvement in credit loss, and we did have about $0.01 coming from just higher lease termination fees
and some of the contributions from the joint ventures on a onetime basis. But $0.37, $0.38 is really a
recurring number that we would expect in the fourth quarter.

And the next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI.

Samir Upadhyay Khanal
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just in terms of occupancy, I mean, when I look at that number, you're already at over 94%. We've talked
about how strong leasing is. Can you provide some color on how you think occupancy could trend maybe
in the end of the year and how much pickup you could see next year? I mean you're sort of your high
water mark level, if you call it, sort of that 96.5%. So trying to figure out how much upside there is into
next year.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Sure. Yes. I mean obviously, the last few quarters have been very strong with, on average, about 30 basis
point gains between -- when you blend the 2 together. I tend to like to look back to try to understand
what's going to happen going forward. So during the Great Recession, when we were going through the
recovery period, we averaged about a 15 basis point gain when -- over an extended period of time to
recover back to the occupancy that we lost.

Now when you look at the pandemic and COVID, we ended up losing less about 270 basis points versus
around 400 basis points in occupancy, though it's over a much shorter period of time. So you're starting
to see that recovery cycle pick up a little bit sooner. And when I looked out, if we're ranging that 10 to 30
basis point occupancy gains quarter-over-quarter, that feels about right.

Conor C. Flynn

Just to clarify that 15 basis point gain in occupancy, that's a sequential average.

That's the goal. That's the goal. We wish every day to push it as aggressively as we can and hopefully
with the higher-quality portfolio and all the efforts and the investments that we made at site -- on sites
that we have that opportunity. Do you see -- I think we're well positioned to do it. One thing we haven't
mentioned is the pandemic really shine a light on the quality of the landlord and the landlord and its ability
to make critical investments for the health and support and in some cases, the survivability of the tenants
when we launched that TAP program back in April of 2020, it was a real lifeline to help a lot of these great
operators that were just struggling for something that was completely outside of their control. And that
helped us really secure and retain a number of tenants, and you start to see that now with our retention
levels achieving sort of historic highs on our end as well. So I think when you mix in all these components,
we have the right ingredients and now it's incumbent upon us to execute.

Sure. Yes, we mentioned is a 180 basis point gain. 120 of those basis points were related to Weingarten
and 60 was related to Kimco.

Hong Liang Zhang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

Got it. And in terms of thinking about your development, redevelopment pipeline, I guess when should we
expect to see some projects in the Weingarten portfolio be added in there?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Sure. I think it's important to look at our redevelopment pipeline in 2 separate but complementary
categories. The first is our core retail and repositioning effort. So the repositioning and remerchandising
of the anchor boxes, of building a better mousetrap for the existing retailers. That's where you're going
to continue to see a lot of investment, and we're just in the process of integrating those opportunities
and those projects into the combined Kimco portfolio. So that should start to be reflected in the coming
quarters.

And then the second part of that is obviously our Signature program. The one project we did activate
earlier on was the Milton, the second tower at the Pentagon, where we had recently completed The
Witmer, and that's the 250 residential unit project. And when we look at those projects going forward, we
have a real menu of options. We have over 4,000 entitled residential units that we can draw upon now.
Our goal is to obviously expand the entitled and the built population to over 10,000 -- 10,000 to 12,000 in
the next 5 years. So we'll look at those selectively and determine at what point in time it makes sense to
activate them and at what structure.

And the structure will then -- is influencing factor in how much capital we actually have to deploy out in
the market.

And the next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays.

Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Just a question on the demand related to last mile. Given warehouses are sold out naturally, it seems
like it could be a pretty powerful driver of demand. Could you quantify how much leasing demand you're
seeing related to retailers needing more distribution in their local areas?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Sure. It's hard to quantify right now. But anecdotally, what you're seeing is retailers are looking to
potentially either expand their back of house. So they're looking for some additional square footage to
do some inventory. You're also seeing others like some of the grocers that are actually repurposing some
of their square footage within the 4 walls to utilize for last-mile fulfillment and micro fulfillment. And so
they'll actually receive the goods from the loading dock and then split and distribute them into to do
different categories, one goes to the floor to sell to the customers that walk into the store, while the
balance goes to the micro fulfillment facility, which is actually within their existing 4 walls.

And I think what you're seeing right now is all the retailers that have the means, experimenting with what
works best for them. I can't say that I'm an expert on supply chain logistics and distribution, but I know
it's extremely complex. And so it's really about, foundationally, how they're set up. But it is clear that we
are having these conversations and that last mile brick-and-mortar distribution is going to be a critical part
for them going forward.

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Yes. And just anecdotally, the last, I would say, 5 to 10 years, we've been dealing with the narrative of
shrinking box sizes, downsizing, downsizing, downsizing and now the question is, hey, is there additional
adjacent space that we can take to enlarge the box. So it has changed, I think the narrative on becoming
more flexible in how you use the square footage and integrating that last mile distribution inside the box.
So to your point, it's one that we're watching closely.

Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Maybe on supply, I mean I know it's not a huge issue now, but given the strong fundamentals, I would
imagine that some people will start to try to build extra supply. What do you think will change the
dynamics of low supply growth kind of in your markets? At what point does it become more of an issue?

Conor C. Flynn
CEO & Director

Costs are a big issue, right? So if you think of the land values where we're located. So if you look at our
portfolio map, that's the main reason why we transformed our portfolio to where it sits today is because
we wanted to be in locations that have high barriers to entry. So when the supply cycle does come back,
it's very hard to make it [ pencil ] to go and buy land and develop a shopping center that would compete
with one of Kimco's.

You've got to look at the, obviously, the FAR as well in terms of the build versus the parking lot. And
that's, again, another barrier to entry in these dense areas. You just don't have the luxury of putting 80%
of your property as a parking lot and not generating any revenues from that. And so we're watching it

closely. We do think there's a good amount of slack still to be absorbed from the pandemic, and we're
experiencing that throughout our portfolio.

But to your point, if rents get to a point where they justify new development, it should start to happen. We
haven't seen it yet, but those barriers to entry is why we've positioned our portfolio where it is because we
don't want to be sitting in an asset that has tremendous amount of unbuilt dirt around it where you can
have a competitor come quickly, out-position you. And so that's why we've done a lot of work to be in the
position we are today.

The next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Two questions from me. You guys closed the brief deal. There's no mortgage debt on that joint venture. Is
there plans to put mortgage debt on that? Or given the -- where your balance sheet sits and where their
balance sheet sits, it's going to stay debt free at this point?

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes, Chris, there actually is a small amount of debt, about $170 million on that portfolio, which we
assumed into the new joint venture.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

It does mature those soon, doesn't it? And I thought you paid it off, but I know it matures soon.

Ross Cooper
President & Chief Investment Officer

Yes, it does. We're having conversations now internally with the partnership, and we'll determine what the
next steps are there.

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

Yes. The expectation, though, is, again, with this partnership, as you've seen in many of our joint ventures
that there'll be property-level debt on it.

Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. And then, Glenn, while I've got you, the portfolio is bigger. It's more diverse. You deleveraged some,
got a lot more liquidity and different levers to pull. Is there a goal of getting a ratings increase from the
rating agencies given that backdrop? Or are you comfortable where you sit right now?

Glenn Gary Cohen
Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer

As we've talked about, again, it is clearly a objective and a goal of ours to get put on positive outlook and
eventually get to an A3 -- A- level. We think it's a separator, a differentiator for us. And it's something
that we think actually should just happen naturally as EBITDA continues to grow, and we continue to
just improve overall capital structure. I mean we really check almost all the boxes for them. Some
monetization of Albertsons, I think over time will -- should hopefully seal the deal for them.
