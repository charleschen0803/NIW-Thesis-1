Presentation

Operator

Good morning, and welcome to the Eversource Energy Second Quarter 2021 Results Conference. My name
is Brandon, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is
being recorded.

I will now turn the call over to Jeffrey Kotkin. You may begin, sir.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's
Vice President for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night
on our website. And as you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call
may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's
current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ
materially from forecasts and projections.

These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various
factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2020, and on our Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021. Additionally,
our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures and how those measures reconcile
to GAAP results is contained within our news release and the slides we posted yesterday and in our most
recent 10-K and 10-Q.

Speaking today will be Joe Nolan, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Lembo, our Executive
Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are John Moreira, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance
and Regulatory; and Jay Buth, our VP and Controller.

Now I will turn to Slide 2 and turn over the call to Joe.

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Thank you, Jeff. We hope that all on the phone are safe and well, and we look forward to seeing you in
person later this year. I will cover a few topics this morning and then turn over the call to Phil to discuss
our mid-year financial results and some new and important grid modernization and AMI developments in
Massachusetts.

I know the most recent months have resulted in weather challenges across the country. In the West,
our peers have needed to deal with heat and wildfires. In New England, we've had increased level of
thunderstorm activity topped off by a glancing blow from tropical storm, Elsa. Crews have worked around
the clock many days restoring power to our customers from tree caused damage to our overhead system.
While our implementation of new technology in vegetation management has limited the scope of many
of the resulting power outages, our dedicated crews continue to be on the front line completing a large
amount of emergency restoration work in hot and humid conditions over the past 1.5 months, and doing
so in a safe and effective manner. Their work has been excellent, and we continue to receive notes of
appreciation from both our customers and municipal leaders.

I was out all day in Connecticut the day Elsa passed through, and I cannot say enough about our team in
preparing for and responding to storm damage in coastal regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts. We
greatly appreciate the recognition of those efforts that we received from Connecticut PURA Commissioners
at the July 14 meeting. As I mentioned during our first quarter earnings call, improving our relationship
with Connecticut policymakers and customers is my top priority as CEO. Earlier this week, a number
of Connecticut legislators joined several state, community, education and labor leaders at our Berlin

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Connecticut campus to celebrate the first class of students who are completing our New Lineworker
Certification Program in partnership with the Hartford-based Capital Community College.

We continue to see steady monthly improvements in our customer favorability ratings, and we appreciate
the positive feedback we are receiving from municipal leaders. But we have to prove ourselves during the
next major storm. I strongly believe that the changes we are implementing to our communication systems
and processes will put us in a much better place the next time a multi-day storm cleanup effort occurs.

Next, I want to provide an update on the offshore wind partnership with Orsted. Over the past few
months, we have continued to make significant progress on the 3 projects that are noted on Slide 3.
Perhaps the most significant development was the agreement we reached with Dominion Energy to
charter the U.S.-built Jones Act-compliant wind turbine installation vessel currently under construction in
Brownsville, Texas. Once construction of the vessel is complete in late 2023, it will sail to New London,
Connecticut, where it will be used to install wind turbines for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind.

The vessel will be one of the largest, most advanced of its kind in the world and will provide a more
efficient approach to construction than the use of feeder barges. Work has recently begun in New London
at the state-owned ocean-facing deepwater pier to convert it into a major staging area for offshore wind.
As you know, the primary variable in our construction timetable is siting approval. We continue to be on a
good path to secure federal Bureau of Ocean Management (sic) [ Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ]
or BOEM approval of 132-megawatt South Fork project in January of 2022, which will enable construction
to begin early next year and be completed before the end of 2023.

During hearings this spring that resulted in Rhode Island Coastal Resource Management Council approval
of the project, we indicated that we would install 12 11-megawatt turbines in connection with this project.
We are making progress on the 2 larger projects as well. State permitting applications in Rhode Island for
Revolution Wind and in New York for Sunrise Wind were filed last December. In April, the Rhode Island
Energy Facility Siting Board issued a preliminary decision and order on Revolution Wind schedule with
advisory opinions for local and state agencies to be submitted by August 26, 2021. Evidentiary hearings
are due to begin by mid-October. The Sunrise Wind application was deemed complete by New York officials
on July 1, initiating a formal review process for the project.

As we noted in May, BOEM is targeting the completion of the review of Revolution Wind for the third
quarter of 2023. Based on that review schedule, we now expect to be able to achieve commercial
operation in 2025. We have not yet received the schedule for BOEM's review of the Sunrise Project, but we
are in a good position with our New London staging area, our turbine installation ship and our suppliers.
So depending on the BOEM review schedule that we expect to receive within the next few months, we
expect Sunrise will reach commercial operation in 2025 as well. These states are consistent with the vision
of the Biden administration which continues to accelerate the review of offshore wind projects proposed
for the Atlantic Coast. It is also consistent with the administration's target of having 30,000 megawatts of
offshore wind operating in the United States by 2030.

Offshore wind is one of several initiatives underway to help our states achieve their greenhouse gas
reduction targets. On July 14, PURA took a major step forward in furthering the state's clean energy goals
when it approved a comprehensive program to support the state's push for having at least 125,000 zero
emission vehicles on the road by the end of 2025. The order is described on Slide 4. We appreciate a
number of the changes that PURA made to the draft decision to enhance the program's expected success.
We will submit an implementation plan based on the PURA order by October 15.

Also on that slide is a description of a proposal that Massachusetts Utilities submitted on July 14 to
further develop the infrastructure that is needed to support rapid conversion of the state's vehicles to
zero emissions. As you can see on the slide, by the end of this year, we will have invested $55 million in
our Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Program, helping to connect about 4,000 charge ports. However, since
transportation is responsible for more than 40% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, significantly
more support is needed to help the state meet its targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50%
by 2030 and 75% by 2040.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Massachusetts had only 36,000 electric vehicles registered as of January 1, 2021. And in 2020, only 3% of
the light-duty vehicles sold in the state were EVs. While that percentage is above average for the country
as a whole, it needs to be enhanced significantly going forward, since at the current pace, we will have
fewer than 500,000 EVs in Massachusetts as of 2030.

We need more than 1 million EVs by then for the state to reach its targets. We have proposed spending
more than $190 million on EV support from 2022 to 2025, including $68 million of capital investment.
These investments are described on the slide and include expanded charger infrastructure investment,
some rate incentives and new opportunities to add EV infrastructure in environmental justice communities.
Our support for our state's greenhouse gas reduction efforts is discussed at length in our 2020
Sustainability Report, which was posted on our website earlier this month. A link to the new report is
included on Slide 5.

The revamp report has incorporated a number of enhancements to provide you with more visibility into
our environmental, social and governance efforts. We're also pleased to share updates on our 2030 carbon
neutrality goal, including our first third-party verification of our 2020 greenhouse gas footprint. We have
a number of teams within Eversource tasked with making our 2030 goal a reality. They include a team
focusing on reducing emissions in 5 principal areas, another team working on developing a strategy
to offset emissions that cannot be eliminated by 2030 and another team that is encouraging all 9,300
Eversource employees to contribute to their best ideas on how we can achieve our 2030 goal. They've
already developed some truly innovative proposals that we are evaluating. Their enthusiasm is just more
evidenced on why I am so confident about Eversource's future.

Now I will turn the call over to Phil Lembo.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Joe. This morning, I'm going to cover 3 areas: second quarter results, the status on
several of the regulatory dockets pending and some exciting opportunities ahead for us in terms of grid
modernization and AMI that Joe alluded to.

I'll start with our results for the quarter in Slide 6. We earned $0.77 per share for the quarter,
including $0.02 per share of cost primarily relating to the transitioning of Eversource Gas Company of
Massachusetts into the Eversource systems. Excluding these costs, we earned $0.79 per share in the
second quarter and $1.87 per share in the first half of 2021. So let's take a look at each of the segment's
performance in the quarter. Our electric transmission business earned $0.40 per share in the second
quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.39 per share in the second quarter of 2020. A higher level
of necessary investment in our transmission facilities was partially offset by a higher share count there.
Our electric distribution business earned $0.35 per share in the second quarter of '21 compared with
earnings of $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2020.

Higher distribution revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. The
higher O&M was largely driven by increased storm activity in the second quarter of 2021 and higher
employee medical expenses. The higher medical expenses was mostly due to the fact that in the second
quarter of 2020, in the midst of the worst COVID in New England, many routine medical appointments
were being canceled, but this has largely returned to normal now in our area. Our natural gas distribution
business earned $0.01 per share in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020. As you know, natural gas
utilities in New England tend to have relatively neutral results in the second quarter.

Our water distribution business, Aquarion earned $0.03 per share in the second quarters of both 2021
and 2020. Beginning next year, we expect Aquarion revenues to be bolstered by a previously announced
acquisition of New England Service Company or NESC. NESC owns a number of small water utilities that
serve approximately 10,000 customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. We continue
to expect to close the transaction before the end of this year. State regulators are currently reviewing the
acquisition and its benefits to customers. Our parent and other company segment had modest second
quarter losses in both years.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Turning to Slide 7. You can see that we have reiterated our amended earnings guidance that we issued
in May. We continue to expect ongoing earnings towards the lower end of our $3.81 to $3.93 per share
guidance. This incorporates a $28.6 million pretax charge relating to our performance in Connecticut
following the devastating impact of tropical storm, Isaias last summer. We recorded the charge in the first
quarter of this year. We also continue to project long-term EPS growth in the upper half of the range of
5% to 7% through 2025, excluding the impact of our new offshore wind projects.

From our financial results, I'll turn to the status of various regulatory initiatives, and I'll start in
Connecticut. We have updated a summary of various proceedings in the appendix of our slides. I
mentioned earlier that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, had finalized the $28.6 million
civil penalty associated with our storm performance last summer. That followed the April 28 release of
a final storm performance decision that we discussed on our first quarter call. As you know, we have
appealed that April 28 decision in Connecticut Superior Court. We do not have a full schedule for those
court proceedings, but expect the case to take many months before the court renders a decision. A
scheduling conference will be held later next month. The April 28 storm order also required a 90 basis
point reduction in Connecticut Light & Power's distribution ROE on top of the $28.6 million penalty. That
pancaking of penalty forms one of the principal basis of our appeal since we believe it violates the state
law that was in effect at the time of the storm.

Additionally, hearings in the temporary rate reduction docket commenced in May will continue next month.
A supplemental hearing is scheduled for August 9, at which time, additional testimonial evidence may be
presented on certain issues, including the applicability and term of the 90 basis point penalty. PURA just
this week notified parties that written testimony on the applicability and term of that penalty may be filed
in advance of the August 9 hearing no later than August 4. CL&P's distribution ROE for the 12 months
ended March 31, 2021 was 8.86% and its authorized distribution return was 9.25%. The schedule for
this proceeding currently indicates the decision date of October 13. We will continue to update you as this
docket proceeds.

Regardless of the status of this rate review, we and our regulators share a common goal of providing
nearly 1.3 million Connecticut electric customers with safe and reliable service and to help the state meet
its aggressive carbon reduction and clean energy goals.

Turning to Massachusetts. Joe mentioned our electric vehicle initiative earlier. On July 1, we submitted
2 other proposals to the Department of Public Utilities. As you can see on Slide 8, the first was an
extension of the grid modernization plan that we began implementing with initial DPU approval back in
2018. The investments we've made on this first phase have allowed us to reduce the scope of outages,
monitor power conditions much more closely and assist in the installation of distributed energy resources
throughout the Massachusetts service territory. The program we submitted to the Massachusetts DPU
earlier this month called for the investment of another $200 million from 2022 through 2025 to further
improve substation automation, wireless communications and expand other programs that would have a
number of other benefits, including reducing peak demand and line losses.

Reducing line loss is an important element in achieving our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. In the same
docket, we're asking the DPU to take the first steps to allow us to embark on a 6-year effort to implement
advanced metering infrastructure for our nearly 1.5 million Massachusetts electric customers along with a
new communications network, media data management system and customer information system.

We project capital investments associated with the full program to be in the $500 million to $600 million
range over the period of 2023 through 2028. These technologies are critical enabling investment that
support the state's 2050 clean energy goals. And as I've mentioned previously, Connecticut is looking at
how AMI should be introduced for CL&P customers. Although PURA has acknowledged the potential for
substantial benefits that AMI can deliver, currently there is no full schedule for the docket at this time.

Finally, I just want to cover recent financings and rating agency actions. In recent months, both Moody's
and Standard & Poor's have changed CL&P's outlook to negative. Moody's changed Eversource parent
outlook to negative as well. While we're not happy with these developments, we understand these
changes are primarily related to the ongoing regulatory proceedings in Connecticut such as the temporary
rate reduction docket and the ROE penalty stemming from the Isaias report. We are pleased that

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Moody's recently affirmed PSNH, Public Service in New Hampshire's rating and outlook, recognizing the
constructive outcome of last year's distribution rate proceeding in New Hampshire.

Also, we recently filed an application to issue up to $725 million of long-term debt at Eversource Gas
Company in Massachusetts. Since we purchased the former Columbia Gas assets last year, Eversource Gas
of Massachusetts has been borrowing long term exclusively through the Eversource parent. We believe
that borrowing at the subsidiary level ultimately will be less costly for customers, and we expect DPU
decision on this application later this year. Like NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, we would expect Eversource
Gas of Massachusetts to borrow in the private markets.

Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff for Q&A.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Phil. And I'm going to turn the call back to Brandon just to remind you how to enter your
questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions]

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Thank you, Brandon. Our first question this morning is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Just starting with the PURA and sort of the 90 basis points ROE reduction, it sounds like one of the more
recent notices open the door for parties to petition for a defined penalty period versus something more
perpetual? How do we -- how should we sort of think about kind of this opening, if you will, to a fixed
length reduction versus indefinite? And then just remind us again what we should be watching for here
going forward?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Sure, Shar. This is Phil. As I mentioned, the docket is open and recently PURA did notify the parties that
they could submit testimony on the applicability of the term of the penalty. So to me, that indicates there's
a consideration of what term would be. As you know, the initial language was using the word indefinite. So
I think that's positive development in terms of setting a specific term for the penalty. So in the docket, the
information that came out last week sort of indicates that could file information there. So what we should
be looking for there is there is a process that will continue on that docket. There's an expectation that an
order would be issued in October with any changes out of their effective November 1 is the current time
line.

Shahriar Pourreza
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division

Got it. And then just lastly, and maybe just shifting to offshore wind and starting with the logistics side.
Redevelopment of the Connecticut State here in New London has had some cost increases, right, from
$93 million to roughly $235 million, obviously paid by the state. But it sounds like everything else is kind
of proceeding. Is there kind of any supply chain issues you're kind of keeping an eye on or logistics that
remain kind of unknowns.

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes. Thanks, Shar. This is Joe. I'll take that. So water work is underway at the New London port. We were
just out there for some inspections. We do have all our onshore permits. It's going very, very well. Last
week, the state finalized the funding. Any of those increases the state is absorbing. So we feel very, very
good about that. And now with regard to supply chain, there are no issues that are impacting any of our 3
projects. All of the projects have everything locked down. So we feel good about that.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

This is actually Ryan on for Jeremy. Just wanted to start on the offshore and maybe on some of the kind
of the siting process you guys are kind of talking about during the script. And thinking about the progress
you guys have been making with some of the fishermen, I know this is kind of an issue with South Fork
and Rhode Island specifically, but kind of want to just kind of get the latest value on the progress you're
making in terms of other stakeholder kind of agreements and kind of the process you're making on those
relationships?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

So thank you for the question, Ryan. We've had a lot of dialogue down there. And I think we've got
some -- a good path forward, and we've got obviously a positive decision we received in July from the
CRMC down there and positive decisions in New York as well as in Massachusetts. So we think a lot of the
concerns or at least the path is pretty clear and we feel good about it.

Ryan John Karnish
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

And then maybe just one on Connecticut. We saw you kind of get their settlement over the finish line
there. Just kind of wondering what prospects you're kind of seeing in the some stakeholders in terms of
maybe potentially settling some of these issues? And what kind of time line we might be thinking about in
terms of something coming out on that front?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes, sure. So generally speaking, a broad multiparty settlement is something that's obviously attractive
to us. We have a long history of settlements, whether it's the NU-NSTAR merger in 2012 or the CL&P
rate case or the Yankee rate case. So we feel good about that. I have been spending most of my time
in Connecticut. We've been out with multiple parties. And I think that the temperature certainly has
reduced and folks are in a good place. I think we need to prove ourselves down there, and we know that.
I think tropical storm, the recent one, Elsa, which passed through was really a good exercise for us to
show that lot of things have changed for our business. So by and large, a settlement is something that's
attractive to us. We were pleased to see that United Illuminating settlement was approved. So we see
some possibilities there.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just going back to the Connecticut docket, the temporary rate reduction docket [indiscernible] obviously
there. I'm just wondering where that stands? And do you guys expect this final order now for the rate
reduction effective [indiscernible] that's addressed as well or that's finalized as well?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Durgesh, you broke up a little bit on the question. Are you talking about the testimony from the intervener
that went in?

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

That's correct. The equity layer, Jeff. That's exactly right.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Yes. This is Phil. During the course of that proceeding, there was testimony and certainly we provided our
own input to that testimony as well as questioned the witness. So by the nature of it being part of the
questioning, I would expect that somehow it could be considered in that proceeding going forward. So
there's no specific area that is to be decided there. I think it was just a testimony that was filed by the
EOE. That's an EOE witness, that's a section of the Connecticut PURA.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just quick clarification, Phil. The AMI filing in Massachusetts, what
portion of that $500 million to $600 million that you mentioned would be incremental to the current CapEx
plans?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

We have currently no CapEx in our 5-year forecast for AMI in Connecticut or in Massachusetts. So any
spending in either state would be incremental.

Durgesh Chopra
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Got it. And do you -- do we see a final decision in mid-2022? Or is that just sort of -- like what the
response means like, is this a formal sort of yes or no, or just feedback from the Massachusetts DPU?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

So we expect a decision in 2022. Mid-year is as good an estimate as any at this stage. So this has been a
long-standing sort of desire, I think, of the commission. We certainly have a need to make a decision on
our metering infrastructure. So the timing is good. So we fully expect decision in mid-year 2022.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Julien from Bank of America.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Maybe to pick up a little bit off the last question and flip it a little bit. When you think about the various
scenarios, you have a history of executing well, you talked about upper half of 5% to 7%. There's a
variety of different pieces that are moving your puts and takes. How do you think about your confidence
level under various scenarios in the upper half here? And I'll let you answer that accordingly because
there's a lot of -- probably too many scenarios to talk about and point out here. But I'd be curious, as you
think about the sort of the decision tree here or pathway potentially?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Thanks, Julien. As we see our 5-year long-term forecast, I'm very confident in our ability to achieve
our growth expectations. As you mentioned, there are always puts and takes. That's what we do as a
management team, and that's what any company would do is manage that process and address issues
that don't go your way and look for other opportunities. So there are various puts and takes that can occur
over the course of any forecast period, but I am confident in our ability to achieve our target.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. Excellent. I'll leave that subject there. Maybe coming back to this offshore wind subject. I suppose
the highest level of observation or question back to you after Shar's question would be, given the more

coincident construction of these projects here, any considerations around logistics that we should be
focused on here, I suppose just given that they're now increasingly lining up against each other?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes. Thank you, Julien. Joe Nolan. Yes, we feel great about the timing. Our projects are really scheduled
in a perfect formation. So we do think there's a lot of opportunity there on mobilization, demobilization to
allow these projects to be able to be constructed in a very orderly fashion, and that's what really excites
us. So yes, definitely opportunities there. The timing is perfect for actually all 3 of them.

Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith
BofA Securities, Research Division

Right. Excellent. And then lastly, just coming back to this question on settlement. And I know --
I appreciate your comments earlier, curious to the extent to which you can resolve perhaps in a
comprehensive manner, all variety, including potential rate case in filing next year in the context of some
sort of settlement here. Just want to push on that subject just a tad more, if you don't mind?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes. Julien, we've -- I think you've had an opportunity to see our success in the past. We can do
settlements that are quite comprehensive. We feel confident that if we get to the table, we've got
obviously at the parties that we have great relationships with, that a comprehensive settlement is
definitely possible here. and it's something that obviously will be attractive not only to us, but I think to
a number of the parties. So obviously very, very busy time down at Connecticut right now. And so I'm
optimistic.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

So just to sort of pick up on Julien's question there on the -- and Joe, you said you were optimistic about
Connecticut and the potential for settlement. Could you give us a feeling for what the key sticking points
are? Because, as you know, Avangrid did this a month ago. And I'm just wondering how should we think
about what the -- what parties are the -- might be the key issue? Or what specific issues are the ones that
probably are the ones for us to focus on being resolved?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes, sure. I mean it's the same parties that we've dealt with. You've got the Attorney General's office, you
got the OCC, you have DEEP. I mean these are the parties, obviously, that we've dealt with in the past.
And that would be the same folks that we would see if we did enter into some settlements.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And is there any key points or key issues that are the sticking points -- that are the key things that
people are focused on that's causing more of an issue than others?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

No. No, I wouldn't say there's any sticking points. There's no specific issues.

Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And then in terms of timing, you guys gave a very detailed sort of rate case regulatory proceeding
outlook and stuff. But how should we think about -- would you expect it before the hearing or how should
we think about that?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Well, settlement is going to occur at any point, as you know, in the process. So -- and it's hard for me to
say we need to let certain things run their kind of regulatory course.

Paul Patterson
Glenrock Associates LLC

Okay. And then, Phil, you called out the ratings downgrade potential. If you guys are downgraded, other
than obviously -- I mean, obviously, impacts the cost of borrowing. But other than that, is there anything
else we should be thinking about? Is there any other sort of potential trigger on covenants or anything we
should be thinking about or anything else?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

No, Paul. There's no -- there are no other triggers that come into play here. And just for clarification,
I think we all know that being on a negative outlook doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be
downgraded. I think the agencies like to see certain progress in particular areas. So in the area that they
sort of highlighted in terms of lowering the outlook was sort of the Connecticut regulatory area. So there
are a lot of dockets going on there. And if those move in a direction that the rating agencies view as credit
positive, then that doesn't mean you're going to get the downgrade, right? They could put you back on
to a stable outlook. So -- but nonetheless, if something were to happen, there are no other triggers that
would be in effect.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Maybe I'll start by following up on that last question about the ratings agencies. I don't expect specific
numbers, but I know there -- the agency is concerned is the regulatory risk, not exactly the balance sheet.
But if they were to downgrade, how would that affect your plans for the mix of debt versus equity in the
coming years?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Well, it's a lot of hypotheticals there. I mean it's -- if that happens, I'd have to see what -- was there
something in a regulatory decision, what the impact of that would be. So I'd say we don't have any plans
at this stage to make any really adjustments in our approach to our capital structure or what we're looking
to do in terms of our debt financings. As you know, we identified that we had $700 million of additional
equity financing that we had identified a couple of years ago, that is still out there that we plan to do over
some longer-term period on a periodic ATM or something basis. And then we're issuing about $500 million
-- about $100 million a year is a better way of saying it out of our dividend reinvestment plan. So we are
continuing to do some dribbling out of equity and then we're doing long-term financings. But I don't have
any specific changes that I would highlight at this stage of the capital structure.

EVERSOURCE ENERGY FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  JUL 30, 2021

Okay. Then next question, Joe, you opened your prepared remarks talking about the positive feedback
to your preparation cohort in response to the storms. Can you give some specific examples of ways that
you've changed your protocols and strategies since Isaias? And if there are any additional new initiatives
that you're planning to roll out to help minimize storm-driven outages?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes, sure. Thank you, Andrew. One of the -- I think, the most impactful kind of system of rollout is a
community-based portal that allows communities to put their priorities in terms of public safety, block
roads, those types of items are in there. We also have crews in each of the communities that's allowed
communities to have their priorities addressed. So those are just some of the, I would say, the other piece
that really goes back to what we had done prior to Isaias because of the pandemic is we have folks that
are located in each of these cities and towns. That's something we were not able to do with Isaias.

As you know, at that point in time, everybody was in lockdown. It was a very complex recovery effort
because we needed double of everything. We had to have single workers in vehicles, we had to have
single workers in hotel rooms, and it was a very, very challenging matter. So when we had this last event
there, Elsa, things were little more back to normal and we had a lot of kind of technology portals that we
had deployed, which was very, very well received. I mean, I was out on the system. I had an opportunity
to talk to several of the cities and towns and all the feedback I received was very, very positive.

Andrew Marc Weisel
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division

Okay. Great. That's helpful. Best of luck going through the next one. Hopefully, you won't be tested
anytime soon, but hopefully, it won't be too bad.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Sophie Karp from KeyBanc.

Sophie Ksenia Karp
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

I wanted to take a stab at Connecticut again, but mainly -- from a slightly different angle. Not to sounds
like a doomer, but with the storm is becoming more frequent and some may even say a new normal, is
there a room for a dialogue there that goes beyond just and sorting through the penalties and the past
performance and establishing a regulatory framework for dealing with consecutive storms as a new normal
line as what they've seen in states -- in the hurricane belt where it has been in occurrence for a while. But
is there a room for [ legislature ] or on the commission level where you have securitizations or trackers for
that type of stuff? So any real like mechanisms that are predictable where you don't have to sort through
each storm individually as we go forward? That's all I have.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Thanks, Sophie. Some of those items have been discussed. Securitization certainly was a topic that's come
up from time to time in Connecticut in terms of storm costs. But usually in a rate proceeding where you're
looking at all your costs and what's in your cost of service, et cetera., in our last settled rate proceeding
at CL&P, we spent a lot of time on storms and what the right level of storm activity was to collect in rates
and what appropriate deferral mechanisms might be there. So there's long been a recognition that these
costs can move around and what's the best way of making sure that customer rates remain as stable
as possible, but there's still an opportunity for collecting these costs going forward. So those kinds of
discussions will continue. and the dialogue will continue.

There's nothing specifically on the table per se in terms of storm cost recovery at this stage. But we've
had discussions on various topics. We spend -- so before you get to storm recovery, one of the areas
we do is try to not have to recover, right? So that means we try to do an effective job on our vegetation

management and the capital spending that we do on technologies to restore customers quickly and
remotely. So in the -- and we spent $200 million a year on vegetation management just to -- across our
system to remove trees and open up rights of way, et cetera. So the best outage to have is not to have
it. I guess that's the best possibility. So we do things -- and the commission has been receptive to our
request for additional funding, but there's still a lot of tree work that can be done in Connecticut as in
other states, but that's an area that we continue or we'd like to continue to have a dialogue on.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.

David Keith Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

A quick follow-up just on that last line of thinking. Is there a CapEx opportunity to look for more reliability
kind of system hardening investments in Connecticut? You mentioned vegetation management and tree
trimming, which seems more on the O&M side of things, but wondering if there's more capital to deploy to
lower the impact of storms going forward in Connecticut?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Well, we do have an approved capital tracking sort of safety, reliability program that we have in
Connecticut right now that we operate under as we do in other states too. So there is -- that would not
be new. We do spend money on technologies to, again, enhance our ability to prevent outages or in the
event that you do have an outage to recover quickly. So there is an opportunity, and we currently have a
mechanism in place to do that.

David Keith Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Okay. Got it. Shifting to offshore wind. I was just -- wanted to clarify what gave you the comfort this
quarter to put specific year, specific dates out there for Revolution and Sunrise? Was it the progress that
you saw at BOEM on the schedule that let you kind of crystallize those years?

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. I'd say that's the primary driver. We've said when we first moved off the date, we said as soon as we
get more clarification, we would go back and work with our partners with Orsted and develop a schedule.
So in the case of Revolution Wind, we certainly -- we have that in place. For Sunrise, it's soon to get
in place. So we're, I guess, cautiously optimistic on that date, and we'll have to wait until we see more
information out of BOEM to be more certain. But that is it. We've seen movement and we have much more
clarity now on dates than we did a year ago.

David Keith Arcaro
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That makes sense. And then just kind of last quick one. Just wondering if there's any thoughts
you might have on the Massachusetts RFP and your competitive positioning there for the next offshore
wind project. Are there advantages you might be able to bring to the table especially as some of the
infrastructure comes online for your other projects that you could potentially lean on?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Sure. Like all state RFPs for when we're evaluating it right now, look at how it fits into our plan there. We
expect other states as well to have it. So it's under consideration.

Vice President of Investor Relations

Next question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.

Steven Isaac Fleishman
Wolfe Research, LLC

I apologize if this was asked, but just there's a lot of different issues in Connecticut that you might be able
to settle on, I guess, if you get to that point of a settlement. Just curious if there's a way to deal with kind
of the need to file a rate case every 4 years? Could that be part of this? Or is that something that has to
happen no matter what?

Joseph R. Nolan
President, CEO & Trustee

Yes, Steve. It's Joe. Absolutely. That could be part of any type of a comprehensive settlement. If that was
something that was important to the parties, that's something we would definitely put on the table.

Philip J. Lembo
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And I'll add to that. That's really more of a legislative mandate, Steve, and it requires PURA to review
the rates. So if the settlement -- if there's information there that would be deemed as a review, that could
take care of that requirement. But that 4-year sort of review is more in the legislative space.

Jeffrey R. Kotkin
Vice President of Investor Relations

Looks like we're all set. We don't have any more folks in the queue. So we want to thank everybody
for joining us today. If you've got any follow-up, please give us a call or send us an e-mail, and have a
wonderful weekend.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now
disconnect.
