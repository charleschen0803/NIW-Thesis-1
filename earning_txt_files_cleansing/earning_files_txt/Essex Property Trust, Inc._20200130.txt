ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Statements made on this conference call
regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions
and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. A number of factors could cause
actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be
found on the company's filings with the SEC.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for
Essex Property Trust. Thank you. Mr. Schall, you may begin.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, everyone, for joining our fourth quarter 2019 call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow
me with comments, and Adam Berry is here for Q&A.

Today, I will review our 2019 results, summarize our expectations for 2020 and provide an update on the
West Coast investment markets.

Beginning with our results, 2019 was a successful year for Essex as we generated 6.4% core FFO per
share growth, representing over 50% better growth than contemplated in our original guidance. Same-
property NOI grew 3.9% in 2019, which was at the high end of our original guidance, reflecting stronger
job growth than we had assumed. For example, Q4 2019 job growth averaged 2.3%, 50 basis points
above our initial 2019 estimate. Once again, the tech-dominant markets in Seattle and Northern California
are leading the way with recent job growth of 3.3% and 2.6%, respectively. Southern California, where
economic growth generally resembles the United States, recently added jobs at a rate of 1.5% on a
trailing 3-month basis. In addition, continued apartment construction delays resulted in less competition
in 2019. We estimate that approximately 33,000 apartments were completed in 2019, about 7% less than
expected. We continue to believe that tight construction labor market conditions will prevent significant
acceleration of supply deliveries. John will provide more color on fundamentals in a moment.

Our initial outlook for 2019 did not assume a significant improvement in the cost of debt and equity
capital. In early 2019, we eagerly bought back our stock at a significant discount to consensus net asset
value. As volatility in the capital markets abated and our cost of capital improved, we altered our business
plan and began actively pursuing investment opportunities. As a result, we are pleased to report that we
exceeded the high end of our acquisition and preferred equity guidance ranges from the focused effort of
our investment team.

In 2019, we added ownership interests in 8 properties for $856 million, as further detailed on Page S-15
of the supplemental. These communities are mostly located in the tech centers along the West Coast in
submarkets we know well and expect to be additive to the portfolio's growth profile. We also committed to
over $140 million to new preferred equity or subordinated debt investments, significantly better than our
production in 2018.

In summary, 2019 demonstrated how we attempt to add value throughout the economic cycle. 2019
was also an important milestone for Essex as we celebrated 25 years as a public company with some
notable achievements, a 17% compounded annual rate of return for our shareholders since the IPO
through the end of 2019. In other words, $100 invested in our IPO would be worth over $5,000 today
with dividends reinvested. Through several economic cycles, our business model has generated an 8.4%
compounded growth rate in FFO per share and a 6.4% rate of growth in our cash dividend, which has
increased every single year. We were very pleased to learn that Essex was recently added to the S&P

500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. I'd like to thank all of the long-standing partners, the Essex team and
shareholders who've contributed to the company's achievements over the last quarter century.

Turning to our outlook for 2020. We continue to see healthy demand for rental housing. Recent job
growth for our West Coast markets continues to exceed the 1.7% forecast for 2020 on Page S-16 of
the supplemental. However, we continue to believe that job growth will likely decelerate in 2020 given
tight labor market conditions and a low unemployment rate, which was 2.7% in the Essex markets as of
November, down 50 basis points from a year ago.

Turning to Slide S-16.1 in our supplemental. We highlight a central theme of our West Coast focus. The
chart on the right of this slide demonstrates that job growth has remained strong on the West Coast
and reaccelerated in 2019, diverging from the rest of the nation. On the left side of the chart, we note
that multifamily permit activity in our metros peaked in 2018 and has declined about 14% from that
peak. Again, a divergence from the recent trends outside our markets. Rising construction costs and a
challenging regulatory environment continued to compress development yields in most of our markets,
which should lead to fewer supply deliveries in the future.

Our delay-adjusted supply estimates for 2020 have not changed from our original estimates last quarter.
Notable changes year-over-year indicate about a 30% reduction in Seattle apartment supply in 2020 and
about a 45% increase in Northern California. Tight labor market conditions on the West Coast continue to
push incomes higher. Per capita personal incomes are estimated to have increased 6% in our markets in
2019, significantly higher than the U.S. average of 3.9%.

Personal income growth has outpaced rent growth in most of our markets since 2016, which is leading
to improved rental affordability. Consistent with this trend, the percentage of customers who moved out
for financial reasons or a rent increase was almost 16% in 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2019, this factor
accounted for less than 8% of those moving out. Despite last year's outsized media coverage of the failed
IPO, WeWork, or the disappointing stock performance of other unicorns, the outlook for economic growth
and new jobs in our markets remains favorable in 2020.

Having closely followed Silicon Valley for the past 4 decades, we are not surprised to see volatility with
respect to VC-backed companies. The venture capital model assumes many failures, which are more
than offset by the hypergrowth of the most successful investments. Bay Area venture capital investments
dipped in the second half of 2019 but remain at healthy levels, well above this cycle's average pace of
investment.

We continue to track over 26,000 job openings listed in our markets by the top 10 largest tech firms, a
12% increase compared to a year ago. The largest tech companies continue to add commercial square
footage at a rapid pace, which John will comment on in a moment. Overall, we are tracking over 38 million
square feet of office construction in our core markets, which is almost 70% preleased and underlies the
need for more housing.

Turning to the investment markets. Cap rates remain stable with A-quality properties in locations trading
in the high 3% to low 4% range, while Bs trade 25 to 35 basis points higher. In this environment, we are
looking primarily for A-minus to B-minus quality communities in markets with the best long-term growth
prospects. Six communities we acquired from our co-investment partner earlier this month are consistent
with this strategy. We are pleased to increase our stake in these high-quality communities while earning a
$6.4 million promote from significant value creation for our partners and shareholders.

The majority of our development pipeline will be leasing up in 2020. We have experienced our share of
development delays due to a challenging construction labor market. However, we remain pleased with the
initial customer response at our development communities and the current leasing pace. We continue to
pursue development opportunities but often see a better risk-reward relationship within preferred equity
and other structured investments.

That concludes my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to John.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Thank you, Mike. For the full year, we achieved 3.4% year-over-year same-store revenue growth, which
was an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year's growth rate. Huge thank you to our E-team for
their outstanding work in improving the customer experience while delivering top results. Our fourth
quarter 2019 results were fantastic with 4% revenue growth over the prior year's comparable quarter. This
was driven by strong market and bolstered by our shift in strategy to increase occupancy in preparation
for both the seasonally slower demand period and expected elevated supply in the fourth quarter of 2019
and the first quarter of 2020. This resulted in 30 basis points growth from the increased occupancy. We
additionally had 40 basis points growth from other income, which included some onetime items such as
lease breaks.

Overall, our markets continue to show strength, driven by year-over-year job growth, 2.3% in the fourth
quarter of 2019, which exceeded our expectations by 40 basis points. Income growth continues to outpace
rent growth, improving affordability in our markets.

Turning to 2020. Our guidance of 3.1% revenue growth at the midpoint contemplates rent growth for our
portfolio of 3%, consistent with long-term CAGRs in our markets, and what is outlined on the S-16 in our
earnings package. Additionally, we have factored in a slight reduction in occupancy of 10 basis points as
well as the negative impact of rent rollbacks related to the recently passed California Assembly Bill, AB
1482, which is a 10 basis point headwind for our California communities. Regarding expenses in 2020,
we continue to see pressure on utilities, taxes and wages with offsets in controllables, resulting in our
midpoint guidance of 3% for our year-over-year operating expense growth.

In terms of supply, the bulk of the new apartment deliveries continues to be in downtown location.
We project that 2020 deliveries will be about 65% lower in our suburban submarkets compared to the
downtown urban submarkets consistent with 2019. Only 12% of Essex' portfolio is concentrated in
downtown urban submarkets. We estimate the demand/supply ratio in our markets, assuming it takes 2
new jobs to absorb each new home, to be 1.7x, meaning demand is continuing to exceed supply across
our West Coast markets.

Lastly, we continue to drive our vision of optimizing our portfolio's performance through our strategic
tech investments, various platform initiatives and asset optimization through data science and analytics.
Recently, we implemented a new lead management system in our call center and plan to roll it out to
the communities this year. Also in the pipeline is our plan to upgrade 20,000 units with smart home
technology and roll out our mobile maintenance platform 2.0 across the company.

Shifting now to an update on our markets. In Seattle, our same-store revenues in the fourth quarter were
led by Seattle CBD with 5.4% year-over-year growth, while other Seattle submarkets grew between 4.4%
and 5%. On jobs, Seattle remained the strongest major U.S. market for job growth in the fourth quarter,
growing 3.3% year-over-year. This growth was mainly due to an additional 32,000 jobs in the top 4 paying
industries, a 57% increase from the prior year.

Regarding major tech activity in the market in recent years, Amazon has committed to a sizable footprint
of nearly 3 million square feet in the Bellevue area while recently putting up 770,000 square feet for
sublease in Seattle. Although we're seeing some local geographic movements, several other major tech
companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook have recently expanded their footprints in Seattle. As
mentioned on a prior call, Apple announced it would expand its Seattle workforce by more than 2,000
employees by 2022, a significant increase from its current census of 450 employees. Other activity in
Seattle includes Airbnb expanding by 60,000 square feet and Bank of America committing to 116,000
square feet of Amazon sublease.

On the other side of the Lake Washington in Bellevue, Facebook preleased an additional 325,000 square
feet, while Alibaba expanded their footprint by 50,000 square feet. Office supply and demand is strong in
the market with over 9 million square feet of office space under construction, 79% of which is preleased.

Multifamily supply in Seattle was down substantially in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to decline
about 30% in 2020 from 2019. Combination of strong income and job growth as well as declining supply is
leading to tight market rental condition.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Moving to Northern California. Year-over-year same-store revenues in the fourth quarter were led by
San Francisco achieving 5.4% growth, followed closely by San Mateo at 5.2%, Santa Clara at 4.6% and
Alameda at 4%. Job growth in the Bay Area averaged 2.6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. San
Francisco, San Jose and Oakland grew at 3%, 2.9% and 1.8%, respectively. The Bay Area continues to
maintain higher job growth in top-paying industries compared to the bottom-paying industries. Office
expansion in the Bay Area remained robust in the fourth quarter. This includes biotech expansion activity,
about 540,000 square feet made up of Amgen's new lease in downtown San Francisco and Zymergen's
new lease in Emeryville.

In the South Bay, Google expanded by over 800,000 square feet, adding a new lease in Sunnyvale in
addition to acquiring a trio of Cisco buildings in San Jose. Airbnb grew their South Bay footprint by signing
a 300,000-square-foot lease in Santa Clara. There is currently over 15 million square feet of office space
under construction in the Bay Area, over 70% of which is preleased.

Looking at 2020 multifamily deliveries in the Bay Area. San Francisco deliveries are expected to be slightly
higher than in 2019, most of which is concentrated in downtown San Francisco and San Mateo. San Jose
is expected to see twice as many deliveries in 2020 than in 2019. And in Oakland, supply deliveries will
remain elevated in the broader market throughout 2020 with significant supply continuing to be delivered
into downtown Oakland, while Fremont will get an influx, half of which will be for-sale condos.

Heading further south to Southern California, year-over-year same-store LA. County revenues for the
fourth quarter were up 3.5% led by Woodland Hills with 5.5%, West LA with 3.7% and the Tri-City
submarket with 3.7%. The LA CBD submarket continues to decline with revenues down 1.6%. LA job
growth in the fourth quarter was 1.5%, 10 basis points above the U.S. average. On supply, we estimate
consistently high deliveries throughout 2020 in LA County. Deliveries in the LA CBD submarket are
expected to remain high at 4% of stock but down materially year-over-year. Our West LA and Woodland
Hills submarkets will see more new supply in 2020.

Moving down to Orange County. Year-over-year fourth quarter revenues were up 4.2% in the South
Orange submarket and 3.1% in the North Orange submarket. Total 2020 supply in Orange County and
San Diego remained consistent with 2019. However, deliveries in both counties are expected to decelerate
through the year.

Lastly, in San Diego, our year-over-year fourth quarter revenues were up 2.8% led by the Oceanside
submarket with 4.9%, followed by Tula Vista with 4% and North City with 3.3%. Job growth for the period
was a healthy 2.3% year-over-year led by professional business services, which made up almost 1/4
of the growth. Apple made progress on their plans to grow their footprint in the San Diego market by
preleasing 200,000 square feet of office space in the Sorrento Valley.

Our Q1 renewals have been sent out at about 4.4%, and our portfolio is currently at 97.2% physical
occupancy with our availability 30 days out at 3.9%.

Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Angela Kleiman.

Angela L. Kleiman
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, John. I will start by providing some color on our 2020 guidance, followed by an update on
capital markets and the balance sheet.

The key assumptions for our 2020 guidance are available on Page 5 of our earnings release and S-14
of the supplemental. We are guiding to a midpoint of 3.1% property revenue and NOI growth this year.
Overall, operating fundamentals in our markets remain healthy as we continue to assume steady market
rent growth near the long-term averages and for our West Coast market to continue to outperform
the U.S. average. Compared to 2019, we are expecting a modest acceleration in Seattle and a slight
deceleration in California, largely attributed to demand and supply trends commented earlier.

Moving on to the core FFO guidance. We are expecting a growth rate of 4.2% at the midpoint in 2020. As
discussed on our previous call, we had a short-term headwind from the repayment of a highly accretive

mortgage-backed security, which generated a 17% internal rate of return for Essex shareholders. The
lost income from this investment accounts for approximately $0.18 of the headwind in 2020 or 1.3% of
our 2020 FFO growth and mostly explains the sequential decline in core FFO between our fourth quarter
results and the first quarter forecast.

Our 2020 guidance also includes the recent acquisition of a 45% joint venture partners interest in
$1 billion portfolio. We expect to recognize a $6.4 million promote from this transaction as well as a
remeasurement gain in excess of $225 million, which incorporates small impairments of approximately
$18 million recognized in the fourth quarter. This gain and promote will be recognized in the first quarter
of 2020, and both are excluded from core FFO. We remain committed to our co-investment platform as it
provides for an alternative source of capital and an attractive risk-adjusted return for our investors. Over
the past 3 years, we have generated incremental earnings for our shareholders from promote income
totaling approximately $66 million.

Lastly, on capital markets activities. In the fourth quarter, we issued a $150 million 10-year unsecured
bond at an effective 2.8% interest rate and prepaid several mortgages with 2020 maturities.
Consequently, we only have $280 million of maturities to refinance this year. We continue to maintain our
discipline to optimize our cost of capital and will remain thoughtful and opportunistic. Our balance sheet
metrics remain strong with over $800 million of available liquidity.
That concludes my prepared comments, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] First question is from Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

With the move to a high occupancy strategy, what are you guys assuming for blended lease rate spreads
for 2020? And then could you also tell us what the spreads look like for the fourth quarter of '19?

John F. Burkart
Chief Operating Officer

Sure. This is John speaking. So the -- going forward, what we are looking at in guidance, again, is 3.1%.
And that's really made up of about 1% -- or sorry, 3% rent growth as we have on our S-16 as well as
some other income. When you say the blended, it would blend to that. We pretty much do not push our
renewals above the market. We keep them consistent with the market, so they really run together. And
that keeps it simple, and it keeps it focused on the customer experience, which is critically important.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

And so what is that blended number versus what it was in '19?

John F. Burkart
Chief Operating Officer

Sure. So in '19 -- 2019, all in, obviously our revenue came in at about 4 -- well, 4% for the fourth quarter,
3.4% for the year, and that was really about 3.2% scheduled rent, which would be the blended number,
and the remaining amount relates to other income items.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Got it. And then just curious what led CPPIB wanting to really dissolve that -- the venture? And what
opportunity set do you see across those 6 communities?

Angela L. Kleiman
Executive VP & CFO

It's Angela here. The -- we have an excellent relationship with our JV partners. And the exit really relates
to the timing of the investment. These properties were formed as individual joint ventures, and most
of them were formed back around 2010. So at this point, we're near that 10-year term, and so it made
sense to have that discussion for the exit. And so going forward, we actually have continued to have active
conversations about future opportunities as they come up. But as you know us, we decided to put an asset
or investment in a joint venture, it's really driven by a function of trying to optimize our cost of capital. So
it depends on where the stock is trading, where the asset sales are coming and et cetera.

Austin Todd Wurschmidt
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Did you consider, I guess, selling outright? Or was the plan all along, really, to buy out their interest?

Angela L. Kleiman
Executive VP & CFO

Well, you see that we actually sold one of the assets in the joint venture in the fourth quarter as well,
and that was MaSo. And so -- and that was a very attractive sub-4 cap rate sale. And so we do evaluate

9

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

whether it makes sense to bring it on this wholly owned or -- really, it's what's the best return for our
shareholders.

Operator

Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb, Piper Sandler.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

So just following up on Austin's question on the CPPIB. Can you just provide a little bit more color on
funding? Was there anything transacted? Or was this sort of an even trade? And then two, Angela, what
the benefit is for 2020? Obviously, you guys are working hard to backfill that CMO. So just curious how
much this played a role in providing an FFO assist for 2020?

Angela L. Kleiman
Executive VP & CFO

So Alex, I'll talk about the funding, and then Mike will chime in on the overall strategy. On the funding,
we used our line of credit to bridge the closing, but our intent is to finance -- refinance with long-term
debt. And on the equity portion, since the portfolio is actually unlevered, we won't need to raise as much
equity to be leverage neutral. So this will allow us to be opportunistic in our equity issuance or we may sell
assets, depending on market conditions.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. And Alex, I'll just add real quickly. Keep in mind that we had a promote, which is noted in the press
release, and we also have a different tax base than what the tax base would be at market. And therefore,
our yield is a little bit higher. And that helps make these transactions attractive to us.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. But maybe I missed it, did you provide what benefit this is on an FFO to...

Angela L. Kleiman
Executive VP & CFO

Oh, you know what, it's incorporated into our guidance. And so if you look at our -- we have a line on
accretion from external activities. That does include the CPP transaction among others.

Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division

Okay. And then second question is, Mike, your favorite topic, regulation and taxation. So with all the fun
of Prop. 10 2.0, Prop. 13 split roll, maybe you can just address your thoughts on what you guys see the
governor in Sacramento as far as increased taxation, if they do the split role, and then how you think the
Prop. 10 2.0 is shaking out at this point?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Alex, I think it's a good question, and it came up very early in the call today, so all good. So as
I probably reported recently or actually last -- late last year, there were 18 bills that were signed by
Governor Newsom dealing with housing. The biggest one was 1482, which was the statewide rent control
initiative. Following up on that, there's been some pretty big allocations of funding for housing, $1.75
billion last year and $500 million that has been discussed as part of the '20 to 2021 budget. And so I think
that the political environment here is to try to wait and see what happens with these large investments
and with 1482 as opposed to going to the ballot box and trying to create a whole different scenario with
Prop. 10 2.0. So I think that the politics of the matter are the legislature has acted, and the state is

Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

10

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

funding the housing shortage issue to a pretty substantial extent and let those things run the course. So
that's what we hope happens.

Obviously, Prop. 10 2.0, they submitted around 950,000 signatures in December. We're still waiting to
see if the ballot qualifies. I'd say that compared to the first go-round, obviously we're early innings, and
so the proposal has not received a great deal of attention at this point in time. And -- but as I go back to
think about Prop. 10, the early polling was that it would pass, and that was noted obviously throughout
the investment community. And it was, in fact, overwhelmingly defeated in the end. And even though this
current proposal is a little bit more palatable to the owners, I still think that it will be difficult to pass. So
-- and by that -- or in support of that, I would suspect that it will be a -- an ongoing discussion, and we
will have an entity that will essentially commit to a robust opposition to Prop 10 2.0. And again, given the
outcome of the last go-round, I expect that we'll be successful once again.

Operator

And our next question is from Shirley Wu, Bank of America.

Shirley Wu
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

So my first question is for John. So as you go into this new first half of the year with more downtown
supply, and you're really focusing on that occupancy, I just kind of wanted to get the sense of, in terms
of cadence of that 10 basis points of occupancy headwind, how is that going? How do you anticipate
that to play out through '20? Is it going to be pretty much an equal spread? Or is it going to see more
deceleration in the first half versus second?

John F. Burkart
Chief Operating Officer

Well, good question. So let me step back a little bit and explain the occupancy or why we made an
adjustment. We take a lot of effort -- put a lot of effort into understanding supply in the marketplace. And
of course, we know from history that seasonally, demand slows down in the fourth quarter and the first
quarter. So as we ended up the third quarter, we held out as long as possible, and then we rapidly made
some changes to increase occupancy, getting ready for what we saw as a little bit of market disruption,
and most certainly in Northern California, where the supply was going to hit the market during this
lower demand period. As we continue through into the -- in the first quarter now, we're still at good
occupancy, and we expect to most likely carry that occupancy. But the reason why we did it is to put
ourselves in a position of strength, so we don't have to. So we -- if we start to see some isolated pockets
of lower pricing, we may hold back and allow a little bit of occupancy to go down a little bit. So we position
ourselves well, remembering every time we walk in a lease at the beginning of the year, it impacts the
entire year, of course, 12 months. So we really got -- have our position -- ourselves positioned strong. All
that said, I expect our occupancy will be higher in Q1. It will go down in Q2 and Q3 and then pick back up
in Q4. Does that answer your question?

Shirley Wu
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division

Yes. That was extremely helpful. And for my second question, Angela, so previously, you did mention the
earlier redemptions, which played out in 4Q. So I was just kind of curious, is there still that expectation
for more deals in your portfolio to be redeemed early? Or are those mostly done so far? And in terms of
pipeline, what's in the work to backfill some of those deals?

Angela L. Kleiman
Executive VP & CFO

Shirley, that's a good question. We do expect heavier redemptions in 2020. And I think you may recall
that we have talked about carefully our investments tend to have a 3-year life. And sometimes, they
get extended longer, which is terrific. And so the redemption timing can be lumpy. So as for 2020, the
redemption outside of the mortgage-backed security investment and so on the preferred equity, a [ mezz ]

is about $145 million. And it's -- between the first half and the second half, it's pretty even and maybe a
little bit heavier in the second half. And of course, you have this probably somewhere around 110-ish, so
that's the cadence. As far as the pipeline, Adam would chime in on that?

Adam W. Berry
Chief Investment Officer

Yes. Shirley, this is Adam. We're pursuing and underwriting several deals in parallel at this point on the
pref equity side. It -- these deals inherently have a long lead time, just like any development deals. So
when they actually come to fruition, it can always be an unknown, but we are pursuing many and have
quite a few in the pipeline.

Angela L. Kleiman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And Shirley, you may recall, we have a guidance of between $50 million to $100 million, so it's a
$75 million midpoint. So that's a good number to -- for modeling purposes. And then the one thing I'll
add is really the timing on this funding because they do lag a little bit, and so you want to layer that
consideration.

Our next question is from Nicholas Joseph, Citi.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

You highlighted the decrease in permit in your markets. But given the current pipeline and the tight
construction environment that you talked about, when do you expect the actual benefit from decline in
terms of deliveries?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. Nick, it's Mike Schall. I think that when we look at permits, you're looking a few years out, and there
is a natural lag there. So connecting the drop in permits over the last couple of years, I think we're still
looking down the road in terms of when that actually comes down. Keep in mind that California, unlike
many places around the nation, has a much longer period as you go through the permitting process and
delivery process. And I think that's complicated to some extent by the lack of or the tight labor markets in
construction in terms of getting things finalized and moving ahead. So I'd say we're looking beyond 2021
to really see a significant impact.

Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc, Research Division

And maybe following up on Shirley's question. And I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about
continuing to pursue development but seeing better risk-adjusted return with preferred equities and the
other structured investments. Obviously, you can get a better return from those, but there's a difference in
duration and length of investment. So how do you think about the size of both of those and the stickiness
of the cash flows?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I'll start big picture, and then Adam can take it from there. Generally speaking, it's a risk/reward
equation, and we will do direct development. And I would say more at the bottom of the cycle because
conditions at the bottom of the cycle are typically better. And by that, I mean there's less pressure on
construction cost. The cities are more receptive to development because they're trying to keep their
construction labor force at work. And so they're more willing to [ forgive ]. As you go through the cycle,
more and more impediments, and I can use a variety of examples for that: public artwork projects that

12

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

are part of your deal, more difficulty in getting the phasing or temporary certificates of occupancy, et
cetera. So the headwinds become more substantial. And so within the preferred equity, I mean we're
looking at the same deals we otherwise could do as a direct developer, but we are looking at that risk/
reward continuum. And we're saying, "Hey, all things being equal, let's do acquisitions and preferred
equity as opposed to more direct development."

So having said that, I'll turn it over to Adam because we -- he has been pretty active at looking at
development deals, and it's not that we are -- and actually, he's found a couple that he likes. So we're
looking at both. We just try to make good [ customer ] decisions and certainly where we are in the
economic cycle. And again, construction cost increases and all the other related factors come into play.

Adam, do you want to add to that, what you're looking at?

Adam W. Berry
Chief Investment Officer

Briefly, yes, I mean we continue to underwrite and track all the land deals throughout our markets.
Unfortunately, though, given dramatic increases that we're seeing in the construction costs relative to
where NOI growth has been, we just -- we've been able to see this real-time through our pref equity
program. Generally speaking, we aren't seeing the necessary yield premium to really pursue the majority
of the development deals out there. As Mike mentioned, there are some that fit into that parameter and
provide the adequate risk-adjusted return. But for the most part, deals are tough to pencil right now.

Our next question is from Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Just 2 questions, kind of both Seattle related. You guys spoke pretty positively about job growth out there,
the strength that you're seeing. And I think you mentioned supply was going to be coming down. When I
look at your 2020 outlook, you've only got, at the midpoint, about a 20 basis point acceleration in revenue
growth in Seattle. And I'm just wondering, the commentary would suggest maybe the market is a bit
stronger than that. So I'm just trying to figure out, are you just trying to be a little cautious here? Is there
something that keeps you more or less flattish? Or how do we sort of interpret that?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Sure. That's a fair question. And at this point in time, you're right, Seattle is doing really terrific. Its rents
are roughly 5% up year-over-year. At the same time, the unemployment is very low. It's around 1.7% in
that zone. So we do expect the employment growth rate to slow down, and that's partly driving it. We're
showing in our S-16, employment slowing down pretty significantly across the board, still staying 50 basis
points over the U.S. average for the Essex portfolio but slowing down because of the low unemployment,
and Seattle has the lowest unemployment of all the areas. So that's the scenario that we have out
there. At this point in time, obviously employment is beating that expectation and would love to see that
continue.

Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Okay. And then I guess kind of the other side on the expenses, clearly, you had very low expense growth
in Seattle. I know there were some kind of tax benefits, real estate tax benefits you got. Can you just, sort
of, remind us of the aggregate benefit in 2019 from that that kind of acts as maybe a headwind on the
expense side in 2020?

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Sure. That's a good question there. On the Seattle property tax, it was an interesting year in 2019 in that
our property tax bill actually came in lower than 2018, and it was all driven by assessment build. And so
what that means is, definitely, from a year-over-year perspective, we have challenges on the comp. In
terms of how we think about Seattle property tax, because it's not -- it's one of those numbers that are
just not as noble.

So in 2019, it was 3% lower than the prior year from the assessments. But the 5 years before that, the
increases were between 13% to 17%. So in 2020, what we tried to do is kind of thread the needle and
looking at like a base run rate of 6%. And then you add into it the refunds, we're looking at low single
digits, the 8%, 9% for Seattle property tax increase.

Our next question is from Neil Malkin, Capital One Securities.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

I'm not sure if you answered Austin's question in the beginning in terms of the new and renewals that you
had in 4Q, but just curious as what you're kind of seeing in January for new and renewals, and what the
occupancy stands at for the portfolio today?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes, sure. So let me go back to make sure I answer that. I may have missed that. So in the fourth quarter,
new rents were about 2.2%., and renewals were about 3.5%. And really, the bigger difference was in
Northern Cal, where the supply was coming into the market. Going forward, in the first quarter, I'll answer
a question on renewals. They went out at about 4.4%. Today, market rents are 2% to 3% up year-over-
year. And that's really a factor of where the slow demand period. So again, it always is a little bit wonky in
December and January. We expect us to -- we expect to achieve the market rents we have laid out in our
S-16. And of course, the strongest market, as I had already mentioned, is Seattle.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Right. And then what's the occupancy?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Oh, occupancy is 97.2%.

Neil Lawrence Malkin
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division

Okay. Great. And then the next one, preferred investments, obviously, you've highlighted is what you guys
are choosing to do in terms of capital allocation. Just curious on the -- either the current book or the ones
you're underwriting, is there an option? Are you trying to get options to actually roll your preferred into
equity or essentially take ownership of those deals when they complete? Or is the financing market just
too easy to -- for the developer to sort of get permanent financing?

Adam W. Berry
Chief Investment Officer

So this is Adam. We look at it several ways. I'd say the most basic kind of down the middle of the fairway,
pref deal is going to be paid off after a certain period of time whether it be 2, 3 years. We do -- however,
with every deal, we have that conversation where there are potential hybrids, where there is that potential
to convert into equity, and it is on a deal-by-deal basis. And we're seeing probably a little more of that
opportunity now given where we are in the cycle.

Our next question is from Rich Anderson, SMBC.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

So on the MAA call this morning, they kind of outlined sort of the silver lining of supply that the rents
are 25% above their in-place rents, and so it's an opportunity for them to deploy some redevelopment
and so on. And so a little bit of a good in a bad situation. Do you see a similar dynamic in your markets
considering you also are sort of a B, B plus type of product? Is the incoming news supply, while
problematic, provides some opportunities for you to redevelop and sort of find that middle ground
between what's being delivered and where your market -- where your rents are today?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Rich, it's a good question, and I'll start in lateral to John after that.

I guess from our perspective, you can't produce a B. So they're -- and therefore, all the supply is in the A
category. So the closer you are to the A, the more impacted you are by the concession environments and
the new deliveries. So in addition to that, you have this -- where is this supply going, which tends to be
more urban downtown as opposed to suburban. So all of these things are factored into that equation. And
I think that we are seeing the best opportunities to redevelop in the suburban B markets. And so I would
suspect that that will continue.

John, anything I missed there?

John F. Burkart
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. No, I think you picked it up.

Richard Charles Anderson
SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division

Great. And then second question, perhaps, for anyone. But any comment on Park Merced, I know you
guys were in that years ago and not this time with AIMCO jumping in. I'm curious if you took a hard look
at it, soft look at it, not looked at it at all? Anything, any kind of color would be interesting.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes, Rich, this is Mike again. It was pretty broadly marketed, and so it wasn't as if that was a quiet deal.
It was marketed around. And when I think about our preferred equity business, we think about really 2
things. One is development deals where we're coming in at the last minute just before start -- just before
the start, so we know what the construction costs are. So we are trying to take that construction cost risk
off the table in those deals. And then we also will do preferred equity on stabilized portfolio, which actually
was the first go-round that we had with Park Merced, when we -- as you alluded to, we had invested in
it once before at a much lower value, by the way. And so this transaction is neither of those because it is
looking at the development deals and trying to assess how they might look. And so it didn't really fit our
basic strategy, and we will, from time to time, deviate a little bit from our strategy if we really see a lot of
value. But yes, we just didn't think that was applicable or appropriate at this time.

I was wondering on the CPP portfolio, if you could provide some color on where the assets are located?
Do they contribute immediately to the same-store pool? Or will it be 24 months from now? And also
how do you think the performance of this portfolio will be on a same-store basis relative to your existing
consolidated assets?

Michael J. Schall

John, so as Angela mentioned, we sold Masso in Q4. So that was in Downtown San Francisco. And so --
and Angela, why don't you take it from here?

Angela L. Kleiman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. And the rest of the portfolio, it's all throughout Northern California. So we have one in San Mateo, one
in Dublin, one in Pleasanton so in the East Bay, and San Jose, and of course, Walnut Creek. So those are
the locations, but it's all Northern California. And as you know, we built these and have operated them.
So we know the assets very well and certainly like them very much and glad to have all of them into our
consolidated portfolio. They will be in the same store next year because, as you may recall, we roll them
in, and it'll -- we'll have 1 year of comparable results before we add them to the same-store pool.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. And can you just remind us why the co-investments generally are accounted for under the equity
method when you own, in many cases, 50% or more of the joint venture?

Angela L. Kleiman
Executive VP & CFO

Yes. It's an off-balance-sheet because of the control reasons. Our partner have essentially comparable
approval authorities on basic items like budgets and financing, and so it's really a technical reason.

Piljung Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

So is there anything different in asset management that you're going to do as you take these assets under
your control?

John F. Burkart

Yes. This is John speaking. No, not at all. The -- operationally, asset management-wise, we operate all
of our assets in a consistent way. Our partnerships -- we have great relationships, and we don't have a
Essex way and then the other way. It's, I call it, the family. It's all one way. We operate it in an integrated
approach across the board, so there won't be changes there. We do like the locations of the assets quite
a bit. They're in the technology markets that are growing, and we're excited about that. But there's not a
change like -- would happen when we're buying an asset from a third party.

Operator

Our next question is from Rich Hill, Morgan Stanley.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Mike, maybe I'll start with you. Just wanted to think about the age of your portfolio and sort of the age of
your assets within your portfolio and how that influences your capital allocation decisions to maybe buy
some assets and sell others.

Michael J. Schall

spglobal.com/marketintelligence

16

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Sure, Rich. Yes. Our portfolio, as you note, is a little bit older than other portfolios, and I would attribute
most of that to the fact that we produce less than 1% of our stock -- of our housing stock per year. And
therefore, as you can imagine, over 20 years, you produce less than 20% of your stock, and therefore,
80% of your portfolio is more than 20 years old. So just a fact of life, and we think that this is a very good
thing that we don't produce a lot of housing in general. And so I think it's just -- that is the nature of our
markets, and we are a reflection of our markets.

In terms of opportunity, again, I would say you can't build a B. And therefore, you see less competition.
And so I'd say, generally speaking, at the early part of the cycle, maybe the As outperform the Bs. And as
you get later on in the cycle, the Bs outperform the A. So all of those broader themes are out there. And
then I would also say that as the A product becomes more luxury oriented, it opens the door toward very
thoughtful redevelopment programs where we can add value and add a yield that is higher than the cap
rate and benefit both from the growth embedded in the redevelopment program and the increase in the
value of the portfolio when you cap it out. So it's kind of all those things.

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Got it. That's helpful, Mike. John, quick question for you. Look, we definitely agree that there's not enough
supply of apartments relative to demand sort of picking back up for what Mike said. And so look, I think a
lot of the questions on this call have been about supply, which is obviously a near-term consideration. But
we've always thought demand and job growth is a big long-term driver over the medium to long term. So
I was wondering if you could just maybe take a step back and help us think about what are you looking for
in your West Coast markets where demand could accelerate to the upside? And maybe what makes you --
what would leave you a little bit more cautious?

John F. Burkart
Chief Operating Officer

Sure. What we see right now is, as I mentioned, we have great demand in the Seattle area. And that
combination with the great demand and the decline in supply is tightening up the rental market quite a
bit. That's terrific. As it relates to cautious, it gets back to just the temporary impact, the disruptive impact
of the supply entering the market. And that, again, is largely located around the downtown locations.
There's some level of that certainly in LA, although LA is getting a little bit better, a little bit less supply
than last year, still downtown LA is problematic. Oakland to some extent, but of course, Oakland is -- you
have to understand Oakland. It fits into the broader Bay Area. And so whereas LA -- downtown LA sits
there in its own market. Oakland is really interrelated to San Francisco because people take BART across.
So you have to look at the demand in a broader area there. But it's the supply that causes some concern,
and it's temporary as you noted. Does that answer your question?

Richard Hill
Morgan Stanley, Research Division

Yes. Yes, yes, it does. It sounds like what you're saying is that the demand side of the equation remains
very, very strong. And although tech is diversifying across the United States, tech remains very strong and
the economies you operate in are quite diverse.

John F. Burkart
Chief Operating Officer

That's true. And I would say with the tech, it is -- it does -- it is going across the U.S., but the
headquarters are still here and the highest paying jobs are still here. So it's -- they're doing a natural
thing as far as taking more of the back office and moving that out and then taking other components of
the business but the creative design, the top-notch aspect of the tech really still located in West Coast.
You find that in each of the different companies that are out here, the major companies. And so it's that
and the incomes that are tied to that which really drives income growth, and that is certainly beneficial.

John William Guinee
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division

Great. Just building on the current discussion, the great affordability migration is alive and well. And
although you have a really good property tax-driven competitive advantage in your markets and with an
ability to really grow outsized FFO. Any chance you would ever look at the higher-growth markets whether
it's Denver, Phoenix, Austin, Portland, places like that?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

John, it's Mike. Well, we've been in Portland before and exited Portland, and we do look at it from time to
time. It's definitely on our list. Portland, the reason why we exited is because they had an urban growth
boundary that they essentially kept expanding, and we convinced ourselves it was not supply constrained.
So I guess it depends on what housing and how these markets adjust. So in our experience, it's not just
the apartment supply, but relatively inexpensive single-family housing meant that essentially as soon as
rents get to a certain level, people go, "You know what? I don't need to pay this rent anymore. I'll just
go and buy a house." And so we look at that dynamic of what the -- what we charge for rent and what
the comparable house and how difficult it is for our renter base to be diluted by homeownership. And so if
we could find markets that satisfy and that look appealing from both those perspectives, good job growth
and the overall amount of supply is somewhat limited and the transition from a renter to a homeowner
is somewhat limited. We think that that is a good market. Practically speaking, and we go through this
process with our Board every year in terms of current markets and other possible markets. So Portland is
definitely on that list. And there are some other markets that are on the list as well. Generally speaking,
they are the more supply-constrained markets.

Our next question is from Hardik Goel, Zelman & Associates.

Hardik Goel
Zelman & Associates LLC

As I look at your guidance, your same-store revenue guidance, just focusing on Northern California, that
range of 2.6% to 3.6%, can you give me some color around what has to happen in the market for 2.6% to
be achieved? And then what has to happen for 3.6% to be achieved? What are the scenarios there?

John F. Burkart
Chief Operating Officer

Well, it really revolves around supply of new homes and then demand and that interaction. The -- we
obviously believe we're going to hit the midpoint. That is the probable target. But the impact -- the
disruptive impact of supply coming into the market in Q1 could negatively impact things. Again, at that
point, you're locking in rents, lower rents possibly, for a longer period of time for the year. On the other
side, if supply gets delayed and it moves into the higher demand season, Q2, Q3, that's beneficial. So it's
a range we expect to hit the midpoint. We knew there's enough supply/demand dynamics going into this.
But if they move around a little bit on us, that will adjust that. Does that make sense?

Hardik Goel
Zelman & Associates LLC

No. It does. And just as a quick follow-up, I noticed you guys are going to be planning on being net
acquirers and you discussed why with your cost of capital. Just the type of product you're looking to buy,
is it going to be more of selling older stuff that others see us value-added and buying recently built stuff?
What is kind of the niche there that you're targeting?

Okay. So on the dispo side -- this is Adam. On the dispo side, we're going to target the assets that
have been slower growing within the portfolio in order to maximize our overall portfolio growth. On the
acquisition side -- on the disposition side, our target is between $100 million and $300 million. As you
noted, we expect to be net acquirers this year. And again, we're looking at just increasing shareholder
return overall. So we're going to be looking at our higher-growth markets. And as Mike alluded to earlier
in the call, we're going to be looking in that probably A-minus to B category. The brand-new stuff, as
we've seen over the last few years, given where that -- the supply is coming, that product has not grown
nearly as well as the Bs.

Hardik Goel
Zelman & Associates LLC

Got it. And then are there plans to renovate something when you buy it? Or is this something you like to
look for something that's already -- that doesn't need any incremental capital?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. This is Mike. Yes, we do just about everything. So if it needs a renovation plan, we will build that
into the pro forma. And if it's in good-quality shape, we will look at that as well. I mean we're really sort
of agnostic as to where the property is from, again, that, let's say, the B minus to A level. It's all about
growth as Adam suggested. And if that growth comes from redevelopment, we're happy with that. If it
comes from us understanding the market and growth rate a little bit better than everyone else, so be it.
Again, we're totally focused on what is the return of what we're buying versus -- compared to the portfolio
as a whole. And that's how we make those decisions.

Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division

Just one question for me. John, you mentioned there is a 40 bps lift to other income this quarter largely
due to lease break fees. It's a lot larger than the last several years in the fourth quarter. So just curious,
what's driving the outsized lease break fees right now?

John F. Burkart
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. Lease breaks was one component. It's the biggest component and I called that out. There was other
items as well. But yes, what was driving the lease breaks really relates to the supply that was coming into
the market in Q4. And again, that goes back to our decision as we saw that the supply was going to start
hitting the market, and we filled up or increased occupancy. We did anticipate this type of thing to happen.
But you go into the low demand period. The concessions start to increase at the new supply, and you get
to about 8 weeks free in some cases, and people will break their lease and transfer. So that's what was
driving it.

Michael J. Schall

Actually, John, I can add that the move out to purchased homes was -- has recovered a lot and was at

any more attractive in certain submarkets? And any chance we see some of the under-construction
apartment projects go condo before leasing?

Michael J. Schall

Yes. And that is a good question. One of the conundrums that we've experienced over the last several

that that's the case at all. In fact, if anything has gone the other way, we've produced more rental housing
-- much more rental housing than we have for-sale housing, and that's been an ongoing dynamic. So we
haven't seen that spread that we had hoped for in pricing a condo versus an apartment value and which,
of course, is what triggers that. And with the recent past increases in the price of the single-family home
being in the minus 3, I think in San Jose to about 1% in the best of our locations. It hasn't helped that
condo versus apartment valuation.

Okay. And then I think I heard you guys say that the negative impact of 1482 is 10 basis points in 2020.
Given your supply issue commentary, do you guys really have that many units where you'd be raising
rents by more than 5% plus inflation this year if you could?

John F. Burkart
Chief Operating Officer

Yes. So where the -- this is John. Where that negative impact comes -- hits the revenue, it really relates to
short-term rentals and the premium associated with that. And so oftentimes, at the end of a lease, we will
always give our customers the options they want. And on the short -- if they want a shorter-term option,
there's a premium related to that, and 1482 restricts that premium, and so that's where the 10 basis point
headwind comes from.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. And does 1482 restrict fees for like parking and other stuff? And is it based on gross or net effective
rents? In other words, most of the apartment REITs are operating on an effective rent basis. Does 1482
lead you to offer a higher face rent and then use concessions to get to essentially a market-rate level? Or
does the legislation see through that game?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

That's a great question. And like a lot of legislation, things aren't always spelled out as much as we would
all like. So that's not necessarily contemplated in the legislation. My sense is that it will get addressed in
the courts. But it's really focused on rental revenue and not other revenue. But as far as the details of
that, I think it will get resolved somewhere in the future.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. And so there's no clarification right now whether or not it applies to face rents or net effective?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

We interpret it as being applied to face rents.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL |  JAN 30, 2020

Okay. So if a unit was renting -- if market rent was $1,000 for 12 months, you guys could theoretically
raise that rent to $1,200 and offer 2 months free and be in the same place economically and have the
ability to have more greater rent growth in the 5% plus inflation by just discounting less?

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes. I mean first, let's go back a step. So the 1482 really impacts renewals, right? When a unit goes
vacant, it's the market rent. So at the end of the lease period, we typically and the residents typically
respond to direct renewal. There's not generally concessions in there, and we are not anticipating going
that direction.

Robert Chapman Stevenson
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division

Okay. Just curious, given your sub-50% turnover, and it keeps heading south every year whether or not
you get into a situation where you actually are going to need at some point greater turnover.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Yes -- no, I mean frankly, I love the fact that we have lower turnover. I think it's reflective of quality of
service out of the assets as well as being fair. We meet the market. We're not trying to push rents beyond
the market. We're fair in how we price things. And again, I think that the site teams are doing a terrific
job. So I think the lower turnover is reflective of that. I'm not sure it's going to go much lower than that.
It -- there's a natural need for people to move.

Operator

We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr.
Michael Schall for closing comments.

Michael J. Schall
President, CEO & Director

Thank you, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today and look forward to seeing many
of you at the upcoming Citibank Conference. Have a good day. Thank you.

Operator
This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your
