ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Hello, and welcome to the Robert Half First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Our host for today's call are
Mr. Keith Waddell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Robert Half; and Mr. Michael Buckley, Chief
Financial Officer.

Mr. Waddell, you may begin.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Hello, everyone. We appreciate your time today. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that the
comments made on today's call contain forward-looking statements, including predictions and estimates
about our future performance. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds.
However, they're subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release
and our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update the statements
made on today's call.

During this presentation, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures and reference these figures
as, as adjusted. Reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental
schedule to our earnings press release.

Our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for Accountemps, OfficeTeam, Robert Half
Technology and Robert Half Management Resources include their intersegment revenues from services
provided to Protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. This is
how we measure and manage these divisions internally. The combined amount of divisional intersegment
revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed. The supplemental schedules just mentioned, also
include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2018 through 2021.

For your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the Investor Center of our
website, roberthalf.com.

We're extremely pleased that our first quarter results exceeded the high end of our guidance and reflect
a broad-based recovery that's well underway. Protiviti's revenues grew 35% year-on-year, reflecting
continuing momentum across its wide array of service offerings, including very strong managed solutions
with staffing. This is Protiviti's 14th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains. Our staffing
operations significantly outperformed their historical sequential trends, led by small and medium-sized
businesses and permanent placement, which grew 22% sequentially.

I continue to be impressed with the adaptability of our teams in navigating the new hybrid and remote
work models with our clients and candidates, helping them grow and find meaningful work.

Company-wide revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter of 2021, down 7% and from last year's
first quarter on a reported basis and down 8% on an as-adjusted basis.

Net income per share in the first quarter was $0.98, increasing 24% compared to $0.79 in the first quarter
a year ago.

Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $68 million. In March, we distributed a $0.38 per
share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $44 million. We also acquired
approximately 797,000 Robert Half shares during the quarter for $61 million. We have 9.2 million shares
available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.

Our return on invested capital for the company was 37% in the first quarter.

Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Buckley.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

Michael C. Buckley
Executive VP & CFO

Thank you, Keith, and hello, everyone. Let's start with revenues. As Keith noted, global revenues were
$1.398 billion in the first quarter. On an as-adjusted basis, first quarter staffing revenues were down 18%
year-over-year. U.S. staffing revenues were $759 million, down 19% from the prior year. Non-U.S. staffing
revenues were $242 million, down 15% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. We have 322 staffing
locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.

In the first quarter, there were 62.3 billing days compared to 63.1 billing days in the first quarter 1 year
ago. The current second quarter has 63.4 billing days, equivalent to the second quarter 1 year ago.

Currency exchange rate movements during the first quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-
over-year staffing revenues by $17 million. This impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue
growth rate by 1.4 percentage points.

Now let's take a closer look at results for Protiviti. Global revenues in the first quarter were $397 million,
$316 million of that is from business within the United States and $81 million is from operations outside
the United States. On an as-adjusted basis, global first quarter Protiviti revenues were up 35% versus the
year ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 37%. Non-U.S. revenues were up 26% on an as-adjusted
basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $6 million and
increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 2 percentage points. Protiviti and its independently
owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.

We remind you that changes to the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as SG&A
or, in the case of Protiviti, costs of services, with completely offsetting changes in the related trust
investment assets classified separately below SG&A. Previously, they were both classified as SG&A. Our
historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-GAAP measure of
combined segment income. This is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for
interest income and amortization of intangible assets.

For your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on Page 7,
highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations
for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020. This is a non-GAAP disclosure so we also show a reconciliation to
GAAP.

Turning now to gross margin. In our temporary and consultant staffing operations, first quarter gross
margin was 38.8% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the first quarter 1
year ago.

Our permanent placement revenues in the first quarter were 11.2% of consolidated staffing revenues
versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter 1 year ago. When combined with
temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 160 basis points compared
to the year ago first quarter to 45.6%.

For Protiviti, gross margin was 26.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to 27.6% of Protiviti revenues 1 year
ago. Adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation expense related to changes in the underlying trust
investment assets, as previously mentioned, gross margin for Protiviti was 26.9% for the quarter just
ended compared to 26.3% 1 year ago.

Company-wide SG&A costs were 30.3% of global revenues in the first quarter compared to 29.4% in
the same quarter 1 year ago. Changes in deferred compensation obligations related to increases in
underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percent of revenue by 0.8% in the
first quarter and decreasing SG&A by 2.4% in the same quarter 1 year ago. When adjusted for these
changes, company-wide SG&A costs were 29.5% for the quarter just ended compared to 31.8% 1 year
ago.

Staffing SG&A costs were 37.3% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.3% in the Q1 -- in
Q1 2020. Included in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

the underlying trust investment assets of 1% in the first quarter compared to income of 3% related to
decreases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter 1 year ago.

When adjusted for these changes, staffing SG&A costs were 36.3% for the quarter just ended compared
to 35.3% 1 year ago. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 12.5% of Protiviti revenues compared to
17.3% of revenues in the year ago period.

Operating income for the quarter was $139 million. This includes $12 million of deferred compensation
expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets. Combined segment income was
therefore $151 million in the first quarter. Combined segment margin was 10.8%.

First quarter segment income from our staffing division was $93 million, with a segment margin of 9.3%.
Segment income for Protiviti in the first quarter was $57 million, with a segment margin of 14.4%.

Our first quarter tax rate was 26% compared to 32% a year ago. The 2020 rate was elevated based upon
the estimated lower coverage of nondeductible tax items due to lower pandemic-impacted revenues.

Moving on to accounts receivable. At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable was $800 million and
implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 51.4 days.

Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in
the first quarter and so far in April all adjusted for currency and billing days. Our temporary and consultant
staffing divisions exited the first quarter with March revenues down 12.5% versus the prior year compared
to an 18.9% decrease for the full quarter.

Revenues for the first 2 weeks of April were up 9% compared to the same period 1 year ago. Permanent
placement revenues in March were up 24.2% versus March of 2020. This compares to an 8.1% decrease
for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of April, permanent placement revenues were up 154% compared
to the same period in 2020.

We provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we've seen during the first
quarter and into April. But as you know, these are very brief time periods, and we caution against reading
too much into them.

With that in mind, we offer the following second quarter guidance. Revenues, $1.435 billion to $1.515
billion; income per share, $1 to $1.10. The midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue
increase of 31% on an as-adjusted basis, including Protiviti. Midpoint EPS of $1.05 would represent an all-
time high for the company.

The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows: revenue
growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing up 23% to 26%; Protiviti up 47% to 49%; overall up 30% to
32%.

On the gross margin percentages, temporary and consultant staffing 38% to 39%; Protiviti 27% to 29%;
and overall 40% to 41%. SG&A as a percent of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment
impacts, staffing 35% to 37%; Protiviti 12% to 14%; overall 29% to 30%.

And segment income, staffing 9% to 10%; Protiviti 14% to 15%; and overall to 11%.

Full year capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs $85 million to $95 million, with $15
million to $20 million in the second quarter.

Our tax rate 26% to 27%, and shares at $112 million.

We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned
in today's press release and in our SEC filings.

Now I'll turn the call back over to Keith.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

Thank you, Mike. Our staffing results accelerated during the quarter, indicating a faster early cycle pace
of recovery than we've experienced in the past. This was very broad-based and seen across geographies,
lines of business, client size and skill levels. As I mentioned earlier, small and medium-sized businesses
led the way after being more negatively impacted during the peak of the pandemic. The NFIB recently
reported that 42% of small businesses had job openings they could not fill, which was a record level. This
bodes well for us.

Our investments in advanced AI technologies have allowed us to adapt quickly to a new marketplace
where remote and hybrid work has become commonplace. Together with our people, these technologies
enable us to find solutions to meet the critical talent and consulting needs of our clients across broader
resource pools. Protiviti continues to thrive with multiyear double-digit growth and a pipeline that is highly
diversified across both solution offerings and client segments. Our blended solutions complementing
Protiviti's offerings with contract talent, allows us to be extremely nimble and cost-effective in response to
client needs, and we expect this offering to be an increasing part of our business going forward.

We're excited about our current momentum and our prospects for the balance of 2021 and beyond,
buoyed by the strength of our brands, our people, our technology and our professional business model.

We'd also like to thank our employees for making possible 2 recognition awards we've received just in the
last few days. These are Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work for in 2021 and Forbes' Best Employers
for Diversity 2021.
Now Mike and I would be happy to answer your questions. Please ask just one question and a single
follow-up as needed. If there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions.

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.

Andrew Charles Steinerman
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division

It's Andrew. Keith, I wanted to ask you if you felt the U.S. has entered a brand-new economic expansion,
which bodes for particularly strong years of revenue growth at Robert Half? Or is there's something about
the 2020 recession that was just different than past recessions, and it really kind of lands us more where
we were in 2019 in terms of the economy, which really only supported mid-single-digit revenue growth on
an ongoing basis for Robert Half?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, Andrew, we would say that it feels very traditional early cycle. And just to quantify that a little bit,
we looked at the first 3 quarters post trough for the recovery post dot-com, for the recovery post financial
crisis and for the recent. And as an example, 3 quarters post trough, first time temp up 13%, perm up
18%. After the financial crisis, temp up 9%, perm up 34%. And this time, temp up 18%, perm up 56%.
Further, if you look at the peak to trough decline, those declines on the temp side are pretty consistent
across those 3 cycles.

Our people would tell you that the recovery feels very classic, that there's improving demand broadly
across all the dimensions that I talked about, that, as always, clients cut deep. They've got lean staff.
As transaction volumes improve, as projects restart, they need more help. They need to restore their
workforce, many times, upskilled. And so for us, it feels very classical. Traditionally, we've got a nice 3- to
5-year runway once we get into recovery, which we believe we're well underway as we've spoken about.

Operator

Your next question is from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

Keith and Michael, first of all, congratulations on the stellar results. I'd like to talk about Protiviti.
Specifically, wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the stellar results that they ended up
having. As you mentioned, 14 straight quarters, 35% growth. If we take a look at the -- what you're
forecasting here going into the second quarter, can you just dimensionalize how much of the uplift is
because you're getting more opportunities, broadly speaking more at bats versus an improvement in
terms of the win rate and really gaining share?

And then can you also talk a little bit about what are some of the drivers? You did say it was broad-based,
but I'm wondering if you could give us some commentary with regards to the public sector work, the IT
work, SPACs, and obviously, we can see the results in terms of staffing in terms of what's being eliminated
for the intersegment revenues. So obviously, that continues to go well. But just wondering if you can give
us some more color there?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Sure. And so, as you said, we're very proud with the 35% growth rate, and it splits pretty evenly between
what I'll call core, their core solutions, tech risk and compliance internal audit, which grew 18% year-on-
year, totally exclusive of public sector and blended solutions. Blended solutions then grew 124%, adding
17 points to the growth rate. So you've got 18 points of the growth rate coming from core. You've got 17
points of the growth rate coming from blended solutions. And by the way, those blended solutions then
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence

8

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

split about 50-50 between public sector and nonpublic sector. So that sizes, if you will, the contribution of
public sector.

If you then look at their core solutions, in tech, which they've been very strategic about picking their
shots as to practice areas, they've been very strategic about making the right hires at the right levels,
including very senior levels. And so they're in cyber, they're in privacy, they're in digital transformation,
data analytics. As I've talked before, tech consulting is now the largest core solution area for Protiviti. Risk
and compliance remains very strong, anti-money laundering, consumer lending regulatory enforcement,
our regulator exam preparation, all very good.

Internal audit, as you spoke about, clearly benefiting from IPOs and SPACs. Further, they've got clients
reinstating their internal audit budgets that have been cut last year during the pandemic, which also
lead to our very aggressive -- conservatively aggressive, we would call, for Q2 with the budget for the
guidance.

The interesting thing about the public sector is it's -- in blended solutions with staffing generally, it's not
just U.S. in that we now have some sizable engagements outside of the U.S. which are contributing.
So we're very pleased with that. As we've talked before, those public sector engagements are around
unemployment, housing assistance. A new and large opportunity we're seeing is in the education space.
There's a lot of funding going to K-12 and higher-level, college-level institutions that are going to get a lot
of funding that are going to need help distributing and accounting for those funds.

We've been pleased about the renewals that we've gotten where we already are, and we're organizing or
mobilizing as we speak to take advantage of this education opportunity. So it's one of those times where
virtually every core solution area as well as the additional work we're getting in blended solutions not only
from public sector, but from nonpublic sector as well, so that we've got a Q2 revenue guide for Protiviti for
up 40%.

Mark Steven Marcon
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division

That's great. Just to be 100% clear, I mean it sounds like you're obviously getting all sorts of different
opportunities. Can you comment a little bit just on the win rate relative to the Big 4 because I suspect you
are continuing to win more, the performance confirm that, number one? And number two, on the public
sector, one of the things that we sometimes hear push back on is that the sense is, "Well, those are just
temporary, they're only going to be here for another few months to a year and then they're going to fade."
What's your sense?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, on Big 4 win rates, understand that the Big 4 are frenemies. On the one hand, we compete with
them; on the other hand, when they're conflicted because of their external audit engagements, we're the
first party they refer to because we don't compete with them on external audit like the other Big 4. So I'd
say our win rate is consistent and rising, particularly in the blended solutions area where they simply don't
have the capabilities that we have.

And on this issue of sustainability with public sector, and I guess, transitory is a word that our Fed
Reserve Chairman likes to use. We've been very transparent that clearly there's a bulge dimension to
the transaction volumes we're helping with. But we've also been clear that we believe we're building new
relationships that we can leverage as they improve their processes, as they improve their controls, as they
modernize their technology. So we're certainly aware that there's a window of time where we're going to
have a very intense relationship with these state and local government and even local school districts, and
we're working very hard to extend those.

We've been very positively surprised or pleased with the extensions we're seeing sometimes into the
second and third quarter with this -- the work that we're already doing. So clearly, there's a bulge element
to what's going on public sector, but it's not only bulge and we think there's an opportunity. And the point
I've tried to make is, and by the way, totally excluding it, Protiviti is still growing 18%. And so that other

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

17 points of growth is gravy and we love it, and we think we can leverage it for longer term. But their core
business is growing 18%. That's a big number.

Operator

Your next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

I wanted to shift the discussion over to the perm segment, which really had a really good quarter, much
better than, I think, most people expected. Can we get a little color where you're seeing that trade, either
in the type of clients or the type of jobs they can place in?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

The great news, Jeff, is that it's across clients. And I would say perm placement is more SMB than the
temporary side, and we are overall. So almost by definition, if it's perm, it's SMB. But as I referred
to earlier, it's bifunctional area, meaning it's accounting and finance and its technology and its legal
and it's marketing and creative. It's by skill level. So it's for the transactional level people, accounts
payable, accounts receivable, payroll, general ledger as well as the higher senior accountants, accounting
managers, controllers. So it's very broad. It's broad across geographies not only within the United States,
but outside of the United States as well.

Good news is candidates are getting more confident to make job changes. Plus being at home, frankly,
makes it easier for them to confidentially interview with our recruiters. So that's good for perm, very
broad, very robust. We've got huge momentum going into the quarter. We gave you our post-quarter
numbers, which were triple-digit growth. So perm, as our people would say, is white hot at the moment.

Jeffrey Marc Silber
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research

Okay. That's great to hear. Can we shift over to the international piece of your business. Can you just give
us a little bit of color by country? And also, do you have any exposure in Mexico?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the latter part is easy. We do not have exposure to Mexico. And we don't do a lot of country-by-
country discussion. I would call out that Germany and the U.K. had particularly good quarters. But frankly,
there was nice recovery across our geographies in Europe and in Asia. So -- all right.

Operator

Your next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

The pace of the early cycle recovery has been fastest than you've ever seen. But I guess I was just curious
if you could compare it a bit to 2019 levels? I guess what I'm trying to get an idea of is how much more is
just left in terms of just pure catching up to pre-pandemic before we start thinking about what the future
growth looks like?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Right. Good question. So we're about just over 20% below 2019 for the temp side, and were about 15%
below 2019 on the perm side. And at our current pace, we fully expect to blow by 2019 sooner rather than
later.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Okay. And just the other question I had quickly was in terms of competition, are you seeing any changes
in the competitive behavior just given, obviously, this big catch-up going on, and I'm wondering if things
are the same or if dynamics have changed?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

And is your question regarding our contract employees we put on engagements or in our internal staff?

Manav Shiv Patnaik
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

No, I meant just more from competition with the On Assignments and other vendors of the world?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I'd say, On Assignment is a competitor and a very specific and relatively small part of our business,
particularly since they focus on mid- and large-cap companies. Even in tech, we focus a lot on SMBs as
well. So there's not a lot of apples and apples there. But I'd say the competitive landscape as to pricing
vis-a-vis our competitors generally hasn't changed much at all.

Operator

Your next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.

Kevin Damien McVeigh
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division

Congratulations on the results. Keith, you talked about all-time high earnings, things like that. Do you
think with the way the business is geared you're positioned for structurally higher margins? Or is it maybe
some inability to hire or excess capacity amongst the staff? How are you thinking about the margin
trajectory of the business relative to where your staffing levels are internally?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well -- and so when we talk about profitability, those discussions have to start with gross margins. And
as we talked before, traditionally, in a downturn peak to trough we're down 300 basis points. This time,
we were only down 100. We're now back to pre-pandemic levels, pay bill spreads have recovered. We've
got lower fringe rates because our higher pay rate divisions make up more of our mix, meaning more of
the payroll isn't subject to payroll tax. And we've also got this tranche of full-time contractors we've talked
about that have higher margins, and that's growing as well.

Temp-to-hire conversions, currently 3.1%. They got -- they were 3.5% in 2018, 2019. They've been as
high as 4% to 5%. So there's some upside there. We would caution in the short term, like for Q2, Q3, we
are projecting some sequential reduction in temp gross margin up to 40 basis points because we've got
to pay our temporary contract staff for time off to get their vaccine and time off to recover from that if
needed. But that's a short-term or, hopefully, transitory thing.

On the SG&A front, from a headcount level, given we're still below even 2019, as I just said, we still think
we've got capacity with existing staff, which, on average, is more tenured than it's been in the past. That
said, particularly on perm and replacement because of its very rapid growth rates, we're going to begin to
slowly add to internal staff there as well.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

Super helpful. And it sounds like from a sourcing candidates, there's no issue there. Is that right? Or how
is it from a candidate perspective?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

I'd say that candidate supply is more nuanced than meets the eye. On the one hand, they're resistant for
on-site opportunities either because they're concerned about COVID, they don't like the commute times,
they don't have child care, they've got school uncertainty for their children, they've got unemployment
benefits.

They've also got out-of-market opportunities as well as local opportunities. And many times, if they
don't live in a big city, they live outside of a big city, but they've got an opportunity now to get big city
pay without even having to move there. So it's a very nuanced situation with candidates. But the good
news is it allows us to add more value because it's more complicated for clients themselves to source
candidates, particularly outside their local markets. So the combination of our experienced recruiters and
the technology that we've developed, give us an opportunity to add value, I would argue, in a new way
and an increased way because of all these candidate nuances.

I think clients are understanding as they try, as they always do to some degree, add people on their own.
It's a different world. It's a more complicated world. And I think relative to clients doing it themselves,
and relative to our traditional competitors, which are local regional firms, they just don't have the
capabilities. They don't have the recruiter relationships, particularly out of market, such that if anything,
our competitive positioning is better than ever.

Your next question is from Gary Bisbee with BofA Securities.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

So the first one on the blended staffing, tremendous success you continue to have. Does that have any
discernible impact on gross margins in the temp staffing business, either up or down? Or is it generally
relatively representative of what they are when you're staffing those people out to an external client?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, so first of all, the staffing temp gross margins we report are not impacted at all by that because it's
been pushed over to Protiviti. If you're asking how the gross margins on the business with clients that's
serviced by both compares to our general -- our normal gross margins, I'd say they're at or maybe a little
above, which is fantastic given that the client base skews much larger and typically, staffing by itself going
to those larger clients would have some margin pressure. That's been avoided by going to market together
with Protiviti.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

But so, is it safe to then say, hey, temp gross margin, 10 points roughly above Protiviti so the revenue
growth there is helping Protiviti margins because of that delta? Or is that the way you price it?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, and so I would say the blended solutions reported in Protiviti are a credence to Protiviti's margins in
large part because there's no bids time or utilization reduction because these people are 100% utilized.
They are only paid when they're working by and large. So that utilization differential makes them accretive
for Protiviti's gross margin because the large portion of Protiviti's workforce is full-time and utilization
management has a huge impact on their margin structure.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

Got it. And then even you give a sense of public sector versus non-public sector, even if we back out a
portion of the public sector, it really feels, like, the blended solutions have gained tremendous momentum
in the last year but even the last several quarters. I guess what...

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Absolutely. Right. You take half of total blended solutions away, and what you have left is blended
solutions that are not public sector. And those area doing good, too.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

Right. And half of year-to-year growth, I think. So it's $30 million or similar to what you said the last few
quarters, the rest of it would be traditional. Is that a reasonable...

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Correct. The rest of it is doing very well.

Gary Elftman Bisbee
BofA Securities, Research Division

Okay. And why has the momentum picked up? Is it just you're selling it more aggressively? Or the clients
are responding? Just trying to think about the durability of the drivers of that momentum.

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, I'd say we're selling it more aggressively, we're consciously adding to developers that focus on
selling just that service. We're adding to subject matter expertise on the Protiviti side that manages
those projects. And so with the success, we've had success to get success. As I said earlier, it's now gone
international, which is really great. It's not just a U.S. thing. We've got some wonderful wins outside of
the U.S. So globally, people on the staffing side and the Protiviti side, they just see that it works, and they
also see that nobody else has it.

Your next question is from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities.

Tobey O'Brien Sommer
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Given the sort of odd nature of the decline and robust rebound to date, how do you think about bill rates
and sort of compensation inflation in this cycle?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

It's -- I would say wage inflation is usually our friend. And as the candidate side tightens, which it's
already doing and is expected to further that, not only do we traditionally pass-through the higher pay
rate, but it also gives us an opportunity to also widen our spread a bit. So you can look back 25 years,
and you can see that wage inflation is our friend. I think any reasonable person would project that there's
going to be some wage inflation as things improve.

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

Okay. On the social costs that typically dampen gross margins exiting the recession and then provide a
nice tailwind for subsequent years of recovery. How is this cycle perhaps different?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, the interesting one is on state unemployment. And this time around the states to get the federal
subsidies had to agree not to charge the claims to individual company accounts but instead to keep them
in a general pool. And I could make the case that we're not going to benefit by that because the general
pool increase will likely or could be argued to be less than what the increases would be had all the claims
been charged to our account.

I mean it's been forever the case across the staffing industry that during downturns the previously
working temporary employees file a lot of unemployment claims that stay with us for 3 to 5 years as the
states average that into their rates. So I'm cautiously optimistic that because the elevated claims that
we read about every day by and large haven't been charged to our individual accounts, that the one pool
concept will benefit us more than it will hurt us, but only time will tell. I don't know that.

Your next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.

Hamzah Mazari
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

So over the past few calls, there's been questions about just your capacity, and you mentioned it a little
bit earlier on the call about having capacity remaining in the business. I guess just maybe ask it slightly
differently. I guess, at the current capacity levels, and given the trends in the business that you're seeing
right now, how long do you think you can go without having to hire internally? It sounds like you're doing
a little bit in perm or expect to. But I guess, in the overall business, when should we expect that to ramp?
Or at what point in the cycle would you want to ramp hiring?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Well, clearly, on the temp side, we think we've got a couple of quarters anyway that we'll be just fine
with the existing staff. And understand that there's a productivity benefit to us with internal remote
work because we no longer have to staff every single office for peak demand but instead, one office
can be assisted by a neighboring office or a distant office remotely when they have peak demands. My
point is we should be more efficient going forward than we've been in the past because we can share
our internal resources across larger areas. So it's not just a matter of because we are recovering, given
prior productivity levels, we need X number of staff. As I've also talked about, the average tenure of our
existing staff is much longer than normal, which also impacts our need to hire.

So long story short, as you referenced, we're beginning to hire in perm probably a couple of quarters from
starting in temp. But even there, it will be at a slower pace than it might otherwise have been because
we've got the benefits of remote work. We've got the benefit of our technology tools that we've seen really
pay off from us for the last 3 or 4 quarters.

Hamzah Mazari
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Great. Just one more and I'll turn it over. And just on M&A, I know you've done some smaller deals
within Protiviti. Is there anything specific to Protiviti that you guys are looking at currently? Are there any
chunkier deals? Or should we expect any smaller deals throughout the remainder of 2021?

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 21, 2021

Well, I'd say that Protiviti is always looking for solution areas for practice groups that fit culturally and
strategically over what they're trying to do. They did the identity management deal last quarter. And so I'd
say stay tuned, but it's just -- it's part of ordinary course of business that they're looking for the practice
areas, smaller consulting firms many times that have the same kind of cultural Big 4 background that they
have.

Your next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

You mentioned that public sector work lifted Protiviti growth by 17% in the quarter. How much did it
benefit temp staffing growth by?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Virtually 0. And it's a very important point, and I'm glad you asked the question. The public sector work,
while it starts in the lines of business on staffing, it gets eliminated. So that intersegment elimination line
you see eliminates all of that work. So the growth rates for temp staffing are not impacted by the public
sector work, it's ex public sector. The public sector is over on the Protiviti side. And as I just mentioned,
you just mentioned, it's about half of their growth rate, but half of 35% is still a really big number.

Keen Fai Tong
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Got it. Very helpful. And then if you look at performance in the temp staffing business in the U.S. and
compare that to Europe, how would you compare the various trajectories of the recovery?

M. Keith Waddell
Vice Chairman, President & CEO

Amazingly consistent. If you look at temp and perm, and we disclose U.S. versus non-U.S., I would say
they're amazingly consistent. It's amazingly consistent.

Okay, I think that's our last question. Thanks, everyone, for joining.
