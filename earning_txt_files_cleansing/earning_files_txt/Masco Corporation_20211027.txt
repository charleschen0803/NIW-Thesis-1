MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Presentation

Operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Masco Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name
is Jamaria, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being
recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to David Chaika, Vice
President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.

David Chaika
VP of Investor Relations & Treasurer

Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2021 Third Quarter Conference
Call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and John Sznewajs, Masco's Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter earnings release and the presentation slides that
we will refer to today are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will
open the call for analyst questions. [Operator Instructions]

If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at (313) 792-5500.

Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-
looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks
and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial
metrics. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise
noted. We reconcile these adjusted metrics to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which
are available on our website under Investor Relations.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Keith.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm proud of the way
our team continues to execute in these dynamic times. In the third quarter, sales increased 11%, our
fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit top line growth. This was against a strong 16% comp from last
year. This growth came as we continued to face significant supply chain challenges. Certain raw materials
were hard to come by, such as resins, microchips and even pallets. Freight congestion in ports and lack
of trucking capacity contributed to increased delays in shipping and receiving goods and labor shortages
continue to be a challenge. I would like to thank both our employees and our tremendous supplier
partners who together have worked tirelessly to address these challenges. They have kept our plants
running and our customers supplied, resulting in outstanding top line performance.

Operating margin for the quarter was 17.5% as we executed our planned transition to a more normalized
level of SG&A expense to support our brands, innovation and new products.

Moving to our segment performance, beginning with Plumbing. Sales increased 15%, excluding currency,
led by exceptional growth in North America and international faucets and showers and our spa business.
These results highlight the strength of our Plumbing platform diversity across geographies and channels.
To support our continued international growth, Hansgrohe recently announced plans to invest in a new
manufacturing facility in Serbia. This additional capacity will enable further growth and further strengthen
Hansgrohe's capabilities to service customers. We plan to invest approximately $100 million in this project
over the next 3 years.

In our Decorative Architectural segment, sales grew 4% against a robust 19% comp from the third quarter
of 2020.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Pro paint had an exceptional growth of over 45% in the quarter, helping to offset moderating demand in
DIY paint.

DIY paint declined mid-single digits against a tremendous comp of over 25% in the third quarter of
2020. We continue to see indications of DIY paint demand stabilization as demand was fairly consistent
throughout the quarter.

When compared to our third quarter 2019 sales, our DIY paint sales were up over 20%, a clear indication
of a reengaged homeowner and strong home improvement fundamentals.

Lastly, Behr paint was recently recognized as the Home Depot Partner of the Year in the paint department.
This recognition was a result of successfully keeping the Home Depot in stock during the DIY surge last
year. Our continued investment and our joint effort to grow the pro paint category and our commitment
to bringing new and innovative products such as our recently launched BEHR Dynasty to Home Depot.
Each of these has contributed to tremendous growth for both Behr paint and The Home Depot and this
recognition is a testament to the strength of our partnership.

Moving on to capital allocation. We continued our share buyback activity during the quarter by
repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $128 million. In addition, we anticipate deploying approximately $150
million in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases to over $1 billion for the year.

Now let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation. The second half of 2021 is
largely unfolding as anticipated. We experienced low double-digit inflation in the third quarter, and we
expect mid-teens inflation in the fourth quarter. We have taken pricing actions across both segments
and expect to achieve price cost neutrality by year-end. It has been an extremely dynamic year. And our
supply chain and commercial teams have done an exceptional job managing through the many challenges.

Because of this outstanding execution and continued strong demand for our products, we are maintaining
the midpoint of our previous guide and expect to achieve earnings -- full year earnings per share in the
range of $3.67 to $3.73.

Lastly, before I turn the call over to John, we are pleased to share with you that our comprehensive 2020
corporate sustainability report is now available on our website. This report demonstrates our commitment
to environmental, social and governance responsibility.

During a year of unparalleled change, our team members remain committed to maintaining our strong
reputation for ethical business practices, reducing our environmental impact and enhancing our DE&I
efforts. I'm proud of the hard work we are doing every day to ensure that our employees feel a sense
of inclusion, belonging and support. Our progress in ESG is a priority for our Board, and our executive
leadership team. I hope you will take the time to read more about how our long-term sustainability
influences the way we run our business, operate our facilities and contribute to the community.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to John for additional details on our third quarter results. John?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on
adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.

Turning to Slide 7. Demand for our industry-leading brands remain strong, and our teams executed
exceptionally well in a dynamic environment. This resulted in another strong quarter of double-digit top
line growth. Sales increased 11% against an impressive 16% comp in the third quarter of last year.

Net acquisitions contributed 2% to growth, and currency had a minimal impact. In local currency, North
American sales increased 9% from 6%, excluding acquisitions. This strong performance was driven by
outstanding execution to achieve volume growth in pro paint, faucets, showers and spas and by increased
selling prices.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

In local currency, international sales increased a robust 15% or 18%, excluding acquisitions and
divestitures against the healthy 9% comp. Gross margin of 34.2% was impacted by higher commodity
and logistics costs in the quarter. We expect this inflation will have peak impact on our P&L in the fourth
quarter. We will offset these costs with additional pricing actions and productivity initiatives and expect to
exit this year price cost neutral.

SG&A as a percentage of sales was 16.7%. As planned, during the quarter, we increased certain expenses
such as headcount, advertising and marketing, to a more normalized level to support our brands. We
expect this increase to continue into the fourth quarter as these costs continue to normalize.

Operating profit in the third quarter was $385 million, with an operating margin of 17.5%. Our EPS was
$0.99.

Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing growth continued to be strong, with sales up 16% against the 13%
comp in the third quarter of last year. Net acquisitions contributed 2% to this growth and currency
contributed another 1%. North American sales increased 16% or 10% excluding acquisitions. Delta led
this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth driven by strength
in their e-commerce and trade channels. With strong brand recognition and [ channel ] relationships, Delta
continues to drive consumer demand for its products.

Watkins Wellness also contributed to growth in the quarter as both demand and our backlog remains
strong. International plumbing sales increased 15% in local currency or 18%, excluding net acquisitions.
Hansgrohe delivered strong growth as demand continued to improve across Europe in numerous other
countries.

Hansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China and the U.K. all grew double digits in the quarter. Segment
operating profit in the third quarter was $248 million, and operating margin was 18.7%. Operating profit
was impacted by the planned increases in SG&A that I mentioned earlier as well as an unfavorable price/
cost relationship. This was partially offset by strong incremental volume. We anticipate additional SG&A
increases in commodity inflation will most significantly impact this segment's operating margins in the
fourth quarter. we will mitigate the commodity inflation with additional pricing and productivity actions and
expect to be price cost neutral as we enter 2022.

For full year 2021, we continue to expect Plumbing segment sales growth to be 22% to 24% with
operating margins of approximately 18.5%.

Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural sales increased 4% for the third quarter and 3% excluding
acquisitions. Our DIY paint business declined mid-single digits in the quarter, against a more than 25%
comp in the third quarter of last year. Despite this decline, DIY paint demand appears to be stabilizing as
we have seen relatively consistent demand since July.

When comparing to Q3 2019, our third quarter DIY sales are up over 20%. Our Propane business
delivered exceptional growth of more than 45% in the quarter as paint contractors are applying top-rated
Behr paint to more commercial and residential projects. We expect demand in this channel to remain
strong as propane contractors report growing demand for their services. When comparing to Q3 2019,
our third quarter Pro sales are up over 35%. Segment operating margin in the third quarter was 19% and
operating profit was $166 million. Operating profit was impacted by lower volume, increased commodity
costs and higher marketing expense to support the new BEHR DYNASTY product launch, partially offset by
higher net selling prices.

For full year 2021, we continue to expect Decorative Architectural sales growth will be in the range of 2%
to 5% and operating margin to be approximately 19%.

Turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet is strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.3x. We ended the quarter
with approximately $1.9 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion
revolver. Working capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions of 17%.

Finally, we repurchased more than 15.2 million shares in 2021 for $878 million. This is approximately
6% of our outstanding share count at the beginning of the year. We expect to deploy approximately $150

million for share repurchases or acquisitions in the fourth quarter as we continue to aggressively return
capital to shareholders.

And turning to our full year guidance. We have summarized our expectations for 2021 on Slide 11. We
continue to anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to 16% and an operating margin of approximately
17.5%.

Lastly, we are maintaining our 2021 EPS estimate midpoint but narrowing the range to $3.67 to $3.73,
representing approximately 19% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. This assumes a 252 million
average diluted share count for the year. Additional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide
14 of our earnings deck.

With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Keith.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Thank you, John. Demand for our products and home renovation remains strong and at a much higher
level than experienced in 2019. When you compare our third quarter performance to Q3 2019, revenue
is 28% higher. Operating profit is 29% higher. Operating margin is 10 basis points higher, and adjusted
earnings per share is an outstanding 62% higher. With our demonstrated supply chain excellence, and our
ability to offset inflation with price, we believe we are well positioned to carry this momentum into 2022
and deliver margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth consistent with our long-term outlook. We look
forward to sharing our detailed 2022 outlook on our fourth quarter call in February.
With that, I'll now open the call up for questions. Operator?

Question and Answer

Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

Congrats on the results in a pretty tough environment here. First question on the pro paint strength.
Recognizing some of the drivers of broader sort of do-it-for-me strength here and the project demand,
John, you just mentioned. Just given how strong it was, was there -- is there anything else where you
think you may have had some sort of structural success in boosting awareness or market share of BEHR
PRO? Or conversely, should we be aware of any more transitory benefits perhaps as customers are sort of
hustling to find paints where they can, and you guys have done a great job of keeping BEHR PRO in stock.
How should we think about that balance?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Matt, this is Keith. I'll take this, and John, you can add in if you have other comments. I think there
are a few things that really contributed to that 45% growth that we saw in the quarter in pro. First and
foremost, we had really outstanding supply chain execution. I can't say enough about our supply chain
teams, our research and development teams that were able to move formulations and our suppliers.
We've been working with this supply base and have been pretty consistent in our supply register for like
20 years. So those relationships really paid off in our hard work and supply chain and R&D. So really good
availability of product and supply chain execution in general.

We continue to invest in our brands. We've talked about that and we've talked about that last quarter, and
we continue to invest in our brands. And having that leading brand, having the leading quality, having the
leading service levels, all contribute, especially in tough and dicey times like we've just gone through. And
we continue to execute in terms of new product introductions and our innovation pipeline such as BEHR
DYNASTY, a new line of aerosol paints, interior stains, [ Cox ] and other adjacencies.

So our ability to not only have that supply chain execution, but continue with the basics of the business of
investing in the brands and executing new product introductions all paid off. And I think all those things
are helping to drive demand. And we saw that in our performance in the 45% growth that we saw in pro,
and we think that's enabled us to get new customers. And now it's up to us to develop the loyalty, which
we've demonstrated an ability to do. So it was a very challenging quarter for us across paint, both pro and
DIY, but I'm happy with the execution.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. Matthew, the only thing that I would add to Keith's comments is that I think it's also a reflection
of investment that we've made over many years in this program with feet on the street, both calling on
outsiders on paying contractors as well as the investment of people inside Home Depot stores. And also
Home Depot's investment in this program. So it's the joint partnership that we developed after the pro
that I think really helped drive the success that we experienced here in the third quarter.

Matthew Adrien Bouley
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division

That's great color there. Second one just on the Asian supply chain where you guys have a relatively
robust footprint. So just I guess a 2-parter, any quantification you can give maybe on sort of the near-
term cost impacts of everything going on with ocean shipping and transportation from Asia. And then just
longer-term thoughts on any sort of supply chain repositioning that sort of come about as a result of all
these recent challenges.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Sure, sure, Matthew. Not probably like everyone else that's reported so far this earnings season, we faced
supply chain challenges coming across the Pacific. Yes, and we have seen elevated costs to get containers
across to the United States. And we see also as a result, seeing delays in getting product through the port
systems here in the United States, whether it's on the West Coast or any of the other ports that we bring
product in.

So the good news is, even though we've experienced some of that, we have also, as a result of pass-
through some of the price increase down because of the raw material inflation, but because of some of the
logistics inflation that we've experienced. And so that is -- we feel good about our ability to get that price,
and that's a portion of which allows us to feel good about being price cost neutral as we exit here in 2021.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, just to add a little bit to John's comments, I think not strictly in the Asian supply chain. But overall,
when you look at inflation, we're experiencing -- we experienced low double-digit inflation in the third
quarter, and we're expecting in that mid-teens region in the fourth quarter. And as John mentioned, good
work on our commercial teams, and then we will exit the year in price cost neutral.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.

Susan Marie Maklari
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

My first question is just following up on some of the exposure in terms of inflation and inputs there. Can
you talk a bit to what you're seeing in terms of some of the core commodity exposure, things like maybe
copper, brass, any of the sort of chemical inputs on the paint side. And I know you talked about seeing
that mid-teens inflation in the fourth quarter, but just any more detail on how to think about where --
what those trends are.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Sure. As I think we've all read and seen broadly across the industry, there's been a broad-based inflation,
and we're experiencing that same thing. We're seeing it in metals. Zinc and copper, as you mentioned, and
that's across both our segments, particularly in the hardware and the decorative piece of architectural as
well as, obviously, in brass and plumbing. We're seeing them in polymers. And again, that's across both
our segments. Resins and paint, plastics in our plumbing valve drain, for example, with our cross-linked
polyethylene and our cartridges for the valves. We're seeing it there. And then again, same sort of story
across both segments and logistics, container costs continue to escalate. Even things like pallets and,
of course, over-the-road trucking costs associated with some labor constraints that are broadly there in
the trucking industry. So it's broad-based inflation. And we expect to continue to see that in the fourth
quarter. And as we mentioned, done some good work, and we'll continue to do work in the fourth quarter
as it relates to achieving price cost neutrality by the end of the year.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Susan, maybe to put a finer point on Keith's comments. I think for the fourth quarter, that will
probably be the peak of inflation for the year. I suspect we'll feel mid-teens inflation in total across the
company. Probably low teens in the plumbing segment and probably high teens in our paint business. So
pretty significant inflation. But as Keith mentioned, the team have done a terrific job of working to offset
those costs here as we exit 2021.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division

Okay. That's very helpful color. And then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing
across the various channels within plumbing. I know that you kind of highlighted some strength within
the e-commerce as well as the trade channels there. Can you just give us some commentary on how the
various channels are moving? And any implications as we think about the margin trajectory there as some
of those maybe continue to strengthen?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

We're really seeing, again, strong broad-based growth in plumbing. So if you look at geographically, as
we spoke in the prepared remarks, international is strong. We were very, very good growth in China, in
the U.K. and in Germany, which are our core markets for Hansgrohe and then good growth here in North
America. With regards to channel and slicing it up by channel, very strong performance in e-commerce.
We've invested our best and brightest talent there. We've invested our capital in terms of acquisitions to
build, and we've been working for a number of years in terms of our internal capabilities from logistics to
pick and pack quantities of one to handling returns, marketing and generating more efficient search, a
better purchase journey for the consumers, et cetera.

So a lot of work has gone into that, but we saw real strong growth, particularly in Plumbing and e-
commerce and also in the trade channel. And then strong -- as we mentioned, strong pro growth in paint.
So a really good performance across multiple channels and multiple geographies. And I think Susan, that
speaks to the work we've done in terms of the portfolio of driving affordable, smaller ticket items that are
involved in quicker remodels, if you will, and smaller jobs as well as obviously being part of that bigger
ticket job when executed. So that diversity across geographies, channels, price points, et cetera, has
really delivered for us a nice robust portfolio, and I think that's a big part of it.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Susan, maybe give you a little bit more color on one specific channel. Let me talk a little bit about the
e-commerce channel and the recent acquisition of Kraus and how that aided our e-commerce growth.
So Kraus we bought in the beginning, really at the tail end of last year, and the integration is going well,
and they continue to perform above our expectations. When we've made some good investments along
with Kraus' complementary products and online presence, and they help to actually strengthen some of
Delta's market-leading offerings to drive future growth. One of the things we specifically have done is with
the help of Kraus, we've launched Delta branded sinks online utilizing their offering. And this is really a
good contributor to growth here in the back half of 2021. So e-commerce Delta was strong in e-commerce
before we acquired Kraus -- the Kraus acquisition has really complemented Delta's strength in the online
channel to accelerate its growth.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

Really exceptional results across the segments, particularly in paint in light of what some of your peers
are saying. So I have a couple of follow-ups. Keith, I know you mentioned a couple of things around your
kind of your supply chain partners and how you've kind of successfully managed there. But it is striking in
terms of your ability to not just get product, but keep the inflation lower than what I think most of your
public peers have talked about in that segment. So I'd love to hear just a little more detail or color on
exactly kind of how you've managed this or what you think you've done differently than some of your
peers over the last few months?

Keith J. Allman

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

At the risk of maybe being redundant to what I've already talked about. I can't overstate what our supply
chain teams have been able to do. And it's a product of a great partnership with Home Depot and the
simplification and the focus that we have. We work hard to understand the Home Depot consumer, and
we work hard to understand the Home Depot supply chain. And fundamentally, everything that we do is
geared towards and focused on that customer and those consumers. And because of that, I think that
makes us fleet a foot. It makes us -- it helps us be able to do the sorts of things that we need to do and
react quickly when times get tough. It's just -- it's mind boggling when you think about the types of
formulations that we had to go through in our R&D department in terms of changes and revalidations to
be able to move from one supplier to an x, be it on colorant or resins and really, that's across our entire
business, but specifically in paint.

I think when you look at our formulations and how -- what goes into our formulations and what was
particularly tight in terms of capacity, I think that gave us a little bit of advantage. And it has not been
easy. We have changes the challenges, and we continue to have challenges. But fundamentally, I do think
it has to do with the extreme focus and dedication we have on a specific customer or the consumers and
the ability to manage that versus, say, having a more complex lineup where we have different types of
coatings and different types of customers and those sorts of things. So it's an attribute to simplification,
80/20 focus on our teams and absolutely the highest quality workforce, particularly in supply chain and
R&D.

Michael Glaser Dahl
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division

That's great. And then just as a follow-up, BEHR DYNASTY specifically, can you help us kind of size what
the contribution was from a top line perspective in the quarter? And you talked about some increased
marketing costs around that. Just how should we be thinking about that program in the fourth quarter and
on a go-forward basis? And how has the adoption been or the sell-through?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Mike, it's John. So I think the impact on the quarter was relatively light. There was a small load in of
about $20 million in the quarter. So obviously, it helped the top line growth number but it wasn't a huge
driver of the overall growth.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. We're excited about DYNASTY. I'll tell you, it's going very well. It's our best paint ever, best scuff
resistant most one color, high color fast drying, lead certified GREENGUARD. It's just extremely good
paint. It's our highest price point yet. But when you match it with those attributes, it's a good value.
I mean, my father bought some of it. Let me tell you he's [ excited as they get ] and well, that's only
1 point. It's indicative to what kind of value this can bring. And it's an example of how our deep and
extended relationship with Depot can really help. We consistently bring that innovative new products and
market-leading attributes, and we do that. I like to think of our teams right and above their weight class.
We are focused and to your earlier question on supply chain, it kind of shows itself here with DYNASTY,
very happy with DYNASTY in the launch.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

Congrats on a really impressive quarter and a challenging backdrop. And great to see demand being really
strong here. Any color on how you're thinking about organic growth as we look out to 2022 since your
comps to get a little tougher in the first half? And how much line of sight do you have?

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

VP & CFO

Yes, Phil, it's John. You're right. The comps as we go into the first part of 2022 will be tough. Obviously,
when we post 31% growth in Q1 and 53% growth in Q2 in plumbing, I should say, 25% overall, 24% in
Q1, 24% in Q2. And those accounts to go up against. I said, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks,
we've got continued good backlogs in a number of our businesses, and we've got visibility into. We
mentioned the fact that Watkins, our wellness business, continue to have a very strong backlog of
probably several hundred million dollars. Our Plumbing businesses, both Hansgrohe and Delta, to the
extent that we look at their backlogs, they are bigger than they would historically be at this time of the
year, given the seasonality of things generally slowing down. So we do think that the first part of growth
going into the first part of '22 will be good, but obviously, we're up against some pretty tough comps.
Beyond that, Keith, I don't know, paint is -- we got a little bit less visibility into the backlog of paint other
than on the pro business, where we see some of the commercial projects coming through.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I'd add our international markets are also recovering nicely. And we'll have more detail on 2022 in our
fourth quarter call.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Phil, I would say that if you think about the macro trends where we stand right now, the macro trend
is really set up for a good 2022. The 2 big ones that we watch because it really does impact our low-
ticket repair/remodel portfolio of products that we have, our existing home turnover and home price
appreciation. As you know, those 2 have been very good. And you layer those 2 on to the fact that the
consumer's balance sheet is very good. All statistics say that $2 trillion of more savings as a result of the
pandemic that the consumers are sitting on now. And the fact that the home is for the vast majority of
consumers, it's their largest investment. We think this environment bodes well for continued investment in
homes. We're hearing about backlogs of big-ticket projects with contractors. So we think the supply chain
tightness that the consumers have experienced have contributed to that backlog of big ticket projects. And
so going into '22, we think the environment is set up for good growth.

Philip H. Ng
Jefferies LLC, Research Division

That's really helpful. Any color on how you're thinking about when supply chain kind of normalizes and
appreciate some of these challenges. I think there was an expectation for maybe restocking inventory
in the channel in the fourth quarter. Any color on how that has kind of progressed? Is that more of an
opportunity when we think about 2022 as well?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. It's very difficult to predict the supply chain in this environment. I think some things will have a
little bit more lasting impact. I think logistics will probably remain tight well into '22, if you will, the blood
pressure metric that we look at is our fill rates coming from our supply base and our timeliness and
accuracy of delivery dates versus promise. And those are starting to improve. Now we have a long way to
go. We're not back to where we need to be. But I would say in terms of our supply and incoming, we are
starting to see some improvement and a little bit of stabilization as we look at those 2 key metrics.

Just looking at Decorative on the implied 4Q guidance, it's somewhat similar revenue growth compared to
3Q. Do you expect a similar pro out performance to continue through the end of the year?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. We -- I think, again, we would expect the pro to remain strong as we go through the balance of the
year. whether it's going to be the same 45-plus percent growth we realized in Q3 is yet to be determined.
But based on what we're hearing from Pro contractors based on the projects that we're hearing in terms of
contracts or backlogs, we do think the Pro demand will continue to be quite good.

Adam Michael Baumgarten
Zelman & Associates LLC

Okay. Got it. And then just on the SG&A spend kind of normalizing. When do you expect to reach that full
normalized run rate? Is it by the end of this year? Or will it drag into next year?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

They'll probably drag into next year, Adam. If you think about our SG&A spend, we've talked since the
beginning of the year, about $40 million of spend that we pulled out of the system last year during the
height of the pandemic. And we'll slowly layer that back in over the course of the next several quarters.
Keith mentioned earlier, we're investing in our brands. We're investing in innovation, we're investing in
headcount and it's all reflecting itself in some of the top line growth that you witnessed today that we
reported today. So some of that investment, we'll be mindful of it. We're not going to just let it all flow
back in. So suffice to say that our businesses have their fingers on the dials and are actively managing
that cost as it comes back in.

Your next question will come from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Just given the rising price points and inflation, just wondering if you could speak on any change in mix
that you might be seeing in plumbing and paint, if that's being impacted at all.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Garik, mix really wasn't that big of an issue in the quarter. There may have been a little bit of slightly
favorable mix in plumbing as we've seen a little bit greater strength in Europe, which can tend to be --
mean we get more projects, which means our Axor brand does a little bit better. And maybe some of our
spa business has trended to a little bit more of a favorable mix. But beyond that, it's -- it wasn't all that
impactful in the quarter.

Garik Simha Shmois
Loop Capital Markets LLC, Research Division

Okay. And then to the extent you can provide a little bit more color on your expectations for margin
expansion in 2022, recognizing you provide more guidance after next quarter. But given you're going to be
likely exiting this year price/cost neutrality, would you anticipate margin expansion across your businesses
to begin early in the year.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

We've talked about this, and we haven't changed our outlook. And that is that we have a nice drop down
on incremental volume. We'll exit the year at price cost neutrality. There still is questions about where

commodities will move, if at all, in 2022 and a commitment that if they do, we will handle that as we
have in the past with productivity and further price if needed. So when we throw that all together, as
we've talked in the past, we're looking at margin expansion, not in the hundreds of basis points, more
in the tens of basis points, but our commitment and how we drive our leadership teams and how we
structure our variable compensation for those teams is growth above market and margin expansion. That's
fundamentally part of our culture and how we drive our businesses and that's what we will achieve in '22.

Your next question will come from the line of Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities.

Deepa Bhargavi Narasimhapuram Raghavan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Let me start with some October trends. Just curious how that has trended so far? Are you seeing any
seasonality or rebounding? Anything that you're able talk to on October so far, please?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes. I think we've really moved to talking about our quarter and how we've exited the quarter, and we're
not going to get into slicing and dicing that up on a monthly basis. And the reason is because there's ebbs
and flows, there's different parts of our businesses, launch products, have fill and different things happen.
So it's just -- it's more productive and a better indicator for how we're doing for our business if we stick to
the quarter.

Deepa Bhargavi Narasimhapuram Raghavan
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division

Okay. Understood. How about the quarter then? Any surprises, either positive or negative during Q3? And
anything that you would point us out as we move into 2022 to be aware of that we shouldn't probably
carry forward.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

In terms of surprises, not -- it's playing out as we expected. As I said in our opening comments, I will say
that while I have a high expectation of our supply chain team, I was pleasantly surprised and happy to
see how well we really performed. We talked about it in paint. The same could be said in plumbing, and
that had a real impact on our business and how we fared competitively. So that was -- while maybe not a
surprise, it certainly was nice to see, and I'm proud of the teams.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Keith Hughes.

Keith Brian Hughes
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

Questions in plumbing. I guess looking at the growth both in North America and Europe, can you give
some sort of a feel how much of that growth in your units and how much of that growth is price/mix?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Keith, as we look at it, we did see good volume growth in plumbing, both domestically and internationally.
So -- and don't get any acquisitions contributed to growth as well. But if you could factor out the
acquisitions, I'd say if you had to wait the 2 of volume mix versus price, I'd say you come you're much
more heavily weighted on volume than you would on price in the quarter.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Okay. Looking at the difference in growth rates, excluding acquisitions between North America and
international, international that a bit higher. Was there certain regions internationally that really stood out
that pushed it higher than the U.S.?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes. So internationally, yes, the 3 that we mentioned that grew double digits were Germany, China and the
U.K. And as you might expect, Germany and China had a relatively easy, comps compared to -- given the
third quarter of last year. China was actually growing nicely in the third quarter of last year, continued to
grow. So that was a bit of a positive surprise for us, just the strength of the Chinese market over there.

But other than that, if you factor out those 3 large markets, but if you're broadly across the 140 markets
that Hansgrohe sells into, nearly all experienced some form of growth. I mean there are a couple of small
-- very small markets that we sell into that didn't grow. But I'd say 135 of the 140 countries we sell into
grew in the third quarter.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

A couple of questions on dec arc, specifically paint, Keith, I'm reminded about how Behr has this long-
standing history of just excellent fulfillment, and it was good to see that, I guess, that really was a
standout again this quarter. In the DIY segment of the business, if we look at things kind of in terms of
kind of a 2-year stack in your commentary. It kind of suggested that there might have been a modest
volume acceleration in 3Q. But I'm assuming that -- I'm just wondering, was that all just price? Did you
actually see any kind of volume acceleration in 3Q? And then on the Pro side of the business, builders
scrambling around sending guys to Home Depot to go get paint to get homes closed. I'm wondering how
much of a benefit do you think that was to be up 45% and do you think that business can be sticky?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

So a couple of parts to your question. Firstly, yes, we did see some positivity in terms of gallonage when
you look at DIY Q3 '21 versus Q3 '19. So we did see some slight positive gallonage there in terms of
overall volume. Obviously, with the price, we saw some very nice revenue volume when you do that
comparison stack over '19. In terms of -- was our supply chain performance versus competition to factor
and getting a look from some pros, I would say yes. And it's incumbent on us to make that as sticky as we
can. And we'll see, I'll tell you, I feel good about it.

This new DYNASTY brand is being applied and installed by some professionals. We're obviously seeing our
pro line of paint that continues to be installed by professionals, and it's working well. And the brand has
pulled with consumers. And so when you think about the pro and the resi repaint as well as some of the
commercial and more multifamily looks that we're getting, I think we fare well. But it's incumbent on us to
start to develop that kind of loyalty in those pros like we have in other pros. So I think it was certainly a
factor, and we'll work as hard as we can to make it sticky.

Stephen Kim
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division

Yes. Certainly, you have the opportunity, so that's good. If you look at -- I just wanted to clarify one thing
about your many comments on cost inflation. Were there any subsegments worth calling out, let's say,
lighting or hardware or Hansgrohe or whatever. Where you actually were price cost neutral already in 3Q?
Or where you expect to be price cost neutral in 4Q? I don't just mean by year-end, but I mean, actually in
4Q. And could you comment specifically on labor inflation in your outlook?

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

CEO, President & Director

Yes. I'm not going to get into slicing and dicing it by individual commodities or products or segments and
that sort of thing as it relates to price cost. But in terms of labor, that continues to be a challenge as we
talked about. And that's one of the things that we're working very hard to do as it relates to programs,
whether it's white collar or blue collar as it relates to safety in our factories and programs for different
work engagements, if you will, or different work methodologies as it relates to work from home or hybrid
or coming to the office sort of thing to appeal to as much of the labor as we can. And that includes, in
some cases, some wage increase and wage inflation. So yes, labor is an issue. And I think that's globally
across industry, but we're also seeing that.

Your next question will come from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Congratulations on a great quarter. A lot of great execution. I wanted to just -- you talked about trying
to achieve price or you will achieve price cost neutrality by the end of the year. And I guess I'm just
wondering about the extent to which with that push on pricing here in the second half, how much
carryover pricing you would have into 2022. And also, if I could just get some clarification around that
price/cost comment. You noted that you'd be price cost neutral in plumbing, but if you mentioned it for
Decorative Architecture, I may have missed that. Are you expecting with the higher inflation in Decorative
Architecture to be price cost neutral by year-end there as well?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Yes, we are across Masco.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. And carryover pricing for 2022? What are your thoughts there?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, David, there will be some carryover pricing to 2022. We're getting to more color on that on our fourth
quarter call in February.

David Sutherland MacGregor
Longbow Research LLC

Okay. All right. I guess second question, just obviously, a very strong market share performance in pro
paint. But can you just talk about where else within your product mix, you may have gained share in the
quarter?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

We had a very, very solid performance in plumbing, plumbing trade, in particular, e-commerce continues
to be -- we believe we're a leader in e-commerce, and we continue to, we believe, gain share. I'll tell you
that it's very difficult to accurately pin down overall market volume in a particular quarter. So that we'll
see as we end the year and we go through our models that we use to estimate total market size. But I
believe we're gaining share in trade plumbing and e-commerce. Certainly, we think we're gaining share
in our spa business and our wellness business in Watkins, -- That continues to perform quite well. And
when I look at our growth in Europe versus what our competition is doing, I believe we're gaining share in
Hansgrohe as well. But again, it's difficult. I'd like to speak with absolute numbers and run it through our

market model and it's very difficult to see the actual market size quarter-to-quarter. But we're doing well
in Watkins, doing well in Europe with Hansgrohe, certainly in plumbing and the propane we talked about.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Ken Zener from Key.

Kenneth Robinson Zener
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Keith, up 4% headline. As noted, the volumes were down, which contributed to that operating margin.
Could you maybe discriminate if you look at the pain PPI index, it says PPI was up about 10% in the third
quarter. Could you maybe give us a sense of that pricing magnitude? And then for those 3 buckets that hit
operating margins, the volume, commodity costs and marketing expenses, can you maybe give us a sense
of magnitude of those buckets? That's it.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, Ken. So in terms of our paint inflation that we felt in the quarter, we were up mid-teens inflation in
paint. So that was the inflation that we felt in that and obviously had an impact on the margin that we
developed. In terms of -- I'm not familiar with the PPI index or -- but I think that addresses your question.

Kenneth Robinson Zener
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division

Right. And then the impact for the volume versus the other -- the commodity costs for the margin impact?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

So if you think about -- yes, so obviously, with volumes being down, that had a pretty negative impact on
the margins as well as some of the investments that we put back into the business during the quarter. I
think those are the 2 probably the bigger impacts with pricing being a small offset to those.

Operator

Your next question will come from the line of Steven Ramsey from Thompson Research Group.

Steven Ramsey
Thompson Research Group, LLC

Some of our recent channel checks point to some companies reducing SKUs to focus on better margin,
better volume, products given the supply chain issues. Are you doing this in any product categories? And if
so, would it be on a near-term or long-term basis?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Part of our ability to perform as well as we did with respect to supply chain. And this was in plumbing was
simplifying our assortment for a limited period of time. It was for a couple of months, I believe, in that
range to allow our suppliers to do less changeovers, have longer runs and ultimately do a better job of
supplying our customers. So there was a little bit of that, but it was short-lived. It helped out, as I said,
our supply base with longer run. But that was basically simplification in 80/20 thinking as part of the
Masco operating system, and we applied that in this case, during this tough issue around supply chain.
But that's over for the most part, those SKUs are back in line. And that's, again, part of what gives me
confidence that we're starting to get some relief on some of these issues as it relates to supply chain,
particularly from our great supplier partners.

MASCO CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL |  OCT 27, 2021

Great. And then maybe taking that topic and thinking broader the supply chain and labor issues, are they
forcing you to make changes to fill demand and support margins in the near term that will have to be kind
of reversed or changed in a major way as the supply chain environment normalizes over the next 1 year
plus.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Could you restate that question for me? I wasn't tracking with you, I apologize.

Steven Ramsey
Thompson Research Group, LLC

I guess what I'm getting at is the near-term changes to manage this environment that you're having to
make will those have to be reversed in a major way as the supply chain and labor market normalizes over
the next 3 to 6 quarters?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

No. No, no reversing of any kind of things. I was just indicating that we did take some of our lower-volume
complexity off-line for a couple of months to give our suppliers a breather to lengthen their runs. That's
all.

Operator

We do have a question in queue from a participant that did not record their name or their firm name, but
they are calling from a 216 area code.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

It's Eric Bosshard, Cleveland Research. Two things, first of all, the incremental pricing. Do you have to
take incremental pricing now or in 4Q to offset the incremental inflation?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Yes, we will be implementing price in the fourth quarter, Eric, to help offset that inflation, yes.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

In both -- is that in both businesses?

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

Across the company.

Eric Bosshard
Cleveland Research Company

Okay. Okay. And then secondly, in terms of faucets or plumbing, I'm curious if you're seeing within the
business any change in mix in terms of what consumers are buying as you've raised price or as you're
managing a product offering, if you've seen any notable change in behavior from consumers.

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

Not really, no. The mix change has changed, as John talked about, was relatively smaller and more
associated with different regions growing that tend to be higher mix like Europe growing quite well and

that tends to be higher mix in our spas continue to grow, which is a higher price point. But no, we're not
seeing any mix shift as it relates to pricing changes?

Operator

And we do have time for one final question which will come from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe
Research.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wolfe Research, LLC

Just wanted to hop on for a couple items that I don't think have been touched on yet. Clearly, very strong
growth in the pro paint business. Just wanted to understand, in order to make it stickier, have you all
started targeting, I don't know, local or regional builders for exclusive contracts or any other kind of sales
strategies to make sure that this momentum continuous moving forward?

Keith J. Allman
CEO, President & Director

We're not going to get into the competitive nature in terms of our sales force execution and what we're
going after. But fundamentally, that's about understanding the value that we bring and then targeting
the customers that would appreciate that value the most. So we're not going after all of our -- every pro
that's out there. We definitely are segmenting. And that's part, again, of our 80/20 simplification where
we believe we have the best chance that's where we'll put our sales efforts. So we are targeting our sales
approach, and we are looking at different attributes for those specific customers. I won't go and say
specific long-term contracts or anything of that sort. I won't get into specifics. But along those lines of
targeting our offer to what the customer values the most is exactly what our culture is about.

Truman Andrew Patterson
Wolfe Research, LLC

Okay. And then on the M&A strategy, you're generating strong free cash flow $850 million of cash on the
balance sheet. Could you just give an update of your overall strategy there, the pipeline of deals and
valuations. We've been hearing that they're fairly elevated.

John G. Sznewajs
VP & CFO

It's John. I think a good way to think about our M&A strategy is take a look at the 4 recent acquisitions
we've done in the last year. So we did 4 -- of the 4, each of them are very aligned with the strategy of
one of our business units. So in the case of Kraus, Delta is looking to grow their e-commerce strategy and
Kraus is a great complement to Delta's already strong presence in the e-commerce channel, and it's going
to enhance that.

Similarly, in -- we bought Steamist, one of the leading steam shower businesses that focuses on
Delta's strength that the trade -- their trade business with that -- with the steam shower businesses in
demand. It's a hand in glove there. Obviously, the applicator business that we bought earlier in the year,
complements Behr's paint offering. And then the dream -- the high-style dream business we bought in
Europe complements Hansgrohe's high-style showers and faucets.

And so if you think about where we're focusing our efforts, it's on the smaller bolt-on tuck-in type
businesses that have an alignment with the strategy of one of our business units. And really, that's really
focusing on both paint and plumbing. So our team that we've got in place is doing a great job of the
cultivation of smaller businesses. I would anticipate there will be future acquisitions. Obviously, we can't
foreshadow the timing of those, but teams working hard. Part of the reason that we're focusing on the
treatment also is, to your point, the valuations as you move up in terms of the size are quite high. I mean
-- and so we see better value in the lower middle market. And so that's where we're focusing our efforts
at this time. And then I think we'll continue to focus on our efforts in that lower middle market over the
coming months and quarters.
